Stern [1], Thiruvallur R. Gowrishankar [1], Kyle C. Smith [1], and James C. Weaver [1] _[,][\u2217]_,\n\n\n1 Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Institute for Medical Engineering and Science,\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA;\n\n\n_\u2217_ Corresponding author\n\n\n**Cell experiments with large, short electric field pulses of opposite polarity reveal a remarkable phe-**\n**nomenon: Bipolar cancellation (BPC). Typical defining experiments involve quantitative observation of**\n**tracer molecule influx at times of order 100 s post pulsing. Gowrishankar et al. BBRC 2018 503:1194-1199**\n**shows that long-lived pores and altered partitioning or hindrance due to inserted occluding molecules**\n**can account for BPC. In stark contrast, the Assisted Discharge (AD) hypothesis, Pakhomov et al. CellMol-**\n**LifeSci 2014 71(22):4431-4441; Fig. 6, only involves early times of a microsecond down to nanoseconds.**\n**Further, well established terminology for cell membrane discharge relates to membrane potential decays**\n**shortly after pulsing. Discharge is silent on molecular or ionic transport, and does not address the fact**\n**that tracer molecule uptake vs time is measure at about 100s after pulsing ceases. Our critique of AD**\n**notes that there can be an association of AD with BPC, but associations are only necessary, not sufficient.**\n**A BPC mechanism hypothesis must be shown to be causal, able to describe time-dependent molecular**\n**influx. The two hypotheses involve very different time-scales (less than a microsecond vs 100 s) and**\n**very different quantities (volts/s vs molecules/s). Unlike pore-based hypotheses the AD hypothesis lacks**\n**explicit molecular transport mechanisms, and does not address the greatly delayed measured molecular**\n**uptake. We conclude that AD is an implausible candidate for explaining BPC.**\n\n\n**Basic approach:** Use general features of established science for plausibility estimates. This biophysics/physics\nmethod has often been used to obtain rough estimates of the plausibility of reported results, new concepts,\ntheoretical constructs, etc. Testing is widely used, and can be extended to biophysics, including bioelectrics. In\nthe present (biophysics of bioelectrics) order of magnitude (OOM) estimates can be compelling.\n\n\n**Four examples of order of magnitude estimates of plausibility using generally accepted science.** These\n\nare:\n\n\n(1) Implausibility of small 50-60 Hz fields causing cancer [1],\n\n\n(2) Plausibility of animal sensing of very small electric fields [2],\n\n\n(3) Plausibility of biological detection of small chemical reaction rates [3], and\n\n\n(4) Plausibility of nsPEF causing _\u223c_ 100 to 1000-fold more pores than conventional electroporation [4].\n\n\nHere we argue that AD (Assisted Discharge) is an implausible mechanism of bipolar cancellation (BPC). Our\ncritique does not presently apply to excitable cells, as it considers only what is generally known about electroporation (EP), or nanopores, in non-excitable cells. We consider generally accepted science found in the EP\n\n\nPage 1\n\n\n**Figure 1:** \u201cBipolar pulses may assist cell membrane discharge and reduce the membrane time above the critical\nvoltage. Cell membrane is charged ( _bottom_ ) by a monopolar pulse ( **a**, _top_ ) or a bipolar pulse ( **b**, _top_ ). The membrane voltage (arbitrary units) goes from the baseline ( _solid line_ ) to the critical electroporation voltage ( _dashed_\n_line_ ) and above it. The time when the membrane voltage exceeds the critical level is shown by _shading_ . The bipolar pulse reduces this time but does not bring the voltage below the negative critical value. See text for details.\u201d\nThis figure is Figure 6 from [5].\n\n\nliterature. We purposefully do not include experiments carried out by MURI investigators, before and during the\nMURI funding. The rationale is simple and basic: We want to understand what can be expected given established science, mainly publications in the biophysics literature before BPC was considered. Accepted science\ndoes not change just because someone wants to assume that BPC observed at _\u223c_ 100 s is part of AD. \u201dAssisted\ndischarge\u201d means discharge is faster (assisted) because of very large nsPEF fields that make so many pores that\nthe membrane conductance is greatly increased. And that increased conductance is the cause of the more rapid\n(assisted) discharge through the heavily porated regions of the cell membrane. It has nothing to do with tracer\nmolecule data and observations that occur much later, viz. at _\u223c_ 100 s. Here the established scientific facts are:\n\n\n(1) What is generally known about passive and porated cell membrane charging and discharging [6, 7, 8]. See\nFig. 2, with both passive (150 mV/cm) and heavily porated (24 kV/cm) examples.\n\n\n(2) What is known broadly about nanoporation due to nsPEF. Here a number of quantitative models that are\nbroadly consistent with experiments are considered [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The general, established fact is that many small pores (nanopores) are created, which creates large membrane\nconductances.\n\n\n**Basic background and key definitions for BPC.** A defining feature of BPC is experimentally measured decrease in the ratio of tracer molecule influx into a cell for a bipolar pulse (BP) compared to a unipolar pulse (UP).\nElectric field pulses are followed by cell membrane electrical discharge within a few microseconds or less. In\nsharp contrast, tracer influx occurs over a long time (1 - 100 s) after the pulses. This is not trivial: after the\nproposed important discharge, the measured effect is seen 6-8 orders of magnitude displaced in time. This\nmeans the electrically initiated molecule (tracer) transport is an exasperatingly slow process. What can account\nfor this?! How can an early electrical event (discharge) lead to a greatly delayed tracer influx that defines BPC?\nThis essential basic feature is missing. Further, for both UP and BP 24 kV/cm there is immediate poration. A\nnon-porated (passive) membrane is not involved, inconsistent with Fig. 6 of Pakhomov et al. 2014 [5].\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n**Figure 2: Response of small and large amplitude electric fields.** These results show that assisted discharge\nonly occurs for a passive membrane with negligible conductance change (zero electroporation; low strength\nelectric field small channel conductance). The 150 mV/cm, 200 ns unipolar pulse (top left) creates 26 pores in\ncontrast to a 24 kV/cm, 200 ns unipolar pulse (bottom left) that creates 1 _._ 6 _\u00d7_ 10 [6] pores in a 5 _\u00b5_ m radius cell.\nAs in Fig. 6 of Pakhomov 2014 [5], the bipolar case has a much faster discharge after the first half of the BP\npulse. However, this occurs only for small electric fields that cause negligible electroporation. But to elicit BPC\nlarge fields ( _>_ 10 kV/cm) are used, it is a contradiction. Response of two unipolar pulses (with no gap) for the 150\nmV/cm and 24 kV/cm fields are shown in the right column. In all cases pores are created early (rapidly) on the\nfirst pulse and the large conduction is \u201cremembered\u201d.\n\n\nFor perspective, passive (normal) discharge time constant of a cell is about 100 ns to 1 _\u00b5_ s for typical mammalian\ncells [6, 7, 8]. Electroporated cells have spatially distributed pores of various lifetimes, so the effective, local\nconductivity varies spatially and temporally, a complication that is readily addressed by using integrated cell\nsystem models [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19].\n\n\nFor the nsPEF (nanosecond pulsed electric fields) needed to elicit BPC there is an additional feature: As shown\nby the Schoenbach-MURI (ODU) [4] a broad finding is that nsPEF with field strengths of order 10-100 kV/cm\nand sufficiently short pulses (of order 2-1,000 ns) approximately 100-1,000 more pores are created, not limited\nto the outer, plasma membrane (PM), but pores are also created in many organelles within the cell, including\nbacterial-size mitochondria with double membranes. This means that the discharge times are much more rapid.\nAll of the above is a condensed version of what is now established nsPEF biophysics.\n\n\nTo our knowledge the Assisted Discharge (AD) mechanism hypothesis for bipolar cancellation (BPC) was introduced by Pakhomov and co-workers, see their Fig. 6 and associated text, included here as Fig. 1, but it has\n\n\nPage 3\n\n\nno equations [5]. Subsequent publications cite the AD hypothesis. We find six significant flaws, identified and\ndefined below.\n\n\nFlaw #1: There is no quantitative description or prediction of tracer molecule influx, the key measured biophysical quantity that defines BPC. For an illustration of what is needed for a physics-based theory or model we cite\n\u201cwhat Fermi told Dyson\u201d, a one-page commentary in Nature [20]. Here Fermi states: \u201cOne way, and this is the\nway I prefer, is to have a clear physical picture of the process that you are calculating. The other way is to have a\nprecise and self-consistent mathematical formalism. You have neither.\u201d The AD hypothesis provides a qualitative\npicture (Fig. 1; Fig. 6 from [5]), but there are no mathematical calculations that quantify tracer molecule entry into\na cell long after a pulse and its associated electrical discharge (normal or \u201cassisted\u201d).\n\n\n**Figure 3: Passive and Standard EP model response of an isolated cell model** in response to a 10 kV/cm, 5\nns rise/fall time, 60 ns unipolar pulse (left) and a 60 ns + 60 ns 10/-10 kV/cm bipolar pulse (right). The passive\nmodel response is shown in solid line and the EP model response is shown by the dashed curve. The passive\nmodel response for a unipolar pulse shows the transmembrane at the pole increasing to over 4 V (for illustration\nonly) and discharging with a time constant of around 100 ns. However, when EP is included, the response shows\na reversible electrical breakdown (REB): a rapid increase in transmembrane voltage followed by a decrease\nto a plateau which rapidly reaches zero after the pulse ends ( _<_ 1 ns). In the case of the bipolar pulse, the\ntransmembrane voltage decreases much faster (along the lines of assisted discharge) to a smaller negative\npeak before decaying to zero with a time constant of around 100 ns. With the inclusion of EP, there is no REB\npeak during the second half of the BP. Instead the transmembrane voltage remains around -0.44 V. REB is\ncharacterized by a rapid increase in transmembrane voltage at the onset of a pulse which leads to a burst of\npore creation leading to a large increase in membrane conductance. This REB increase in conductance brings\ndown the transmembrane voltage magnitude, limiting pore creation even before the pulse ends. REB is seen as\na plateau in transmembrane voltage following a transient spike. As the unipolar pulse response (left) shows that\nwithout EP, post-pulse transmembrane voltage decays with a time constant of 112 ns while significant EP causes\nthe transmembrane voltage to decrease much faster with a time constant of 10 ns.\n\n\nFlaw #2: There is no electroporation \u201ccritical value\u201d, but instead measurement thresholds. There is no phase-transition\ntype behavior with a rather sudden change, here involving increasing \u2206 _\u03c6_ m (membrane potential or transmembrane voltage). The horizontal dashed line(s) in Fig. 6 in [5] are detection or measurement thresholds that depend\non both pore creation rates at different cell membrane locations, and also on experimental measurement capabilities. There is nothing \u201ccritical\u201d about these events. Instead they are measurement thresholds for either actual\nor Gedanken experiments, governed by signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Continuum theories and molecular dynamics\n\n\nPage 4\n\n\nsimulations are consistent regarding the conditions needed to observe effects due to significant poration for particular experimental conditions (cell geometry and size, pulse waveform, etc.). Detection (measurement) theory\nis well known in physics (and therefore biophysics involving bioelectrics) [1, 3, 21, 22, 23].\n\n\nFlaw #3: Orders of magnitude different time scales. For typical mammalian cells passive discharge occurs over\ntimes of 100 nanoseconds to a few microseconds; active discharge due to applied fields can be much faster if the\nfield creates many pores ( _e.g._ nsPEF). But influx of tracer molecules occurs long afterwards, with tracer influx\ntime scales of 1 to 100 seconds. The AD mechanism offers no explanation for this huge discrepancy.\n\n\nFlaw #4: Cell models must be 2D or 3D, with both an \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d. This feature is needed to account\nfor field and ion/molecule transport both \u201caround\u201d and \u201cthrough\u201d the porated plasma membrane (PM). A cell\nmodel cannot be represented by a local planar membrane model. This is widely recognized in the literature\n\n[19, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19].\n\n\nFlaw #5: Small field pulses should yield Schwann (passive) model behavior. Pulses too small to create nanopores\nshould automatically revert to well-known passive membrane behavior (Fig. 2) [6, 7, 8]. It is not enough to explain\nBPC. The model must also be consistent with all other relevant biophysical behavior, e.g. response of cells to\npulses too small to create large permeabilities or conductances in cell membranes. Passive model responses\ndo not account for the many orders of magnitude increase in membrane conductance and the resulting drop in\ntransmembrane voltage magnitude (Fig. 2).\n\n\nFlaw #6: AD occurs mainly for non-porating fields (Figs. 2, 3). But, fields that elicit BPC create over 10 [5] pores, a\n\n_\u223c_\nvery large number. These pores cause a much faster membrane discharge ( 10 ns) after the pulse.\n\n\nIn general, the literature contains lots of results for pore behavior after pore creation. This undercuts the idea that\none should avoid treating what happens above the critical membrane potential, which is the implication of the AD\nmechanism hypothesis.\n\n### **Acknowledgments**\n\n\nSupported partially by AFOSR MURI grant FA9550-15-1-0517.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\n[1] R.
