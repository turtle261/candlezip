      "abstract": "In this thesis we develop the cohomology of diagrams of algebras and then\napply this to the cases of the $\\lambda$-rings and the $\\Psi$-rings. A diagram\nof algebras is a functor from a small category to some category of algebras.\nFor an appropriate category of algebras we get a diagram of groups, a diagram\nof Lie algebras, a diagram of commutative rings, etc.\n  We define the cohomology of diagrams of algebras using comonads. The\ncohomology of diagrams of algebras classifies extensions in the category of\nfunctors. Our main result is that there is a spectral sequence connecting the\ncohomology of the diagram of algebras to the cohomology of the members of the\ndiagram.\n  $\\Psi$-rings can be thought of as functors from the category with one object\nassociated to the multiplicative monoid of the natural numbers to the category\nof commutative rings. So we can apply the theory we developed for the diagrams\nof algebras to the case of $\\Psi$-rings. Our main result tells us that there is\na spectral sequence connecting the cohomology of the $\\Psi$-ring to the\nAndr\\'{e}-Quillen cohomology of the underlying commutative ring.\n  The main example of a $\\lambda$-ring or a $\\Psi$-ring is the $K$-theory of a\ntopological space. We look at the example of the $K$-theory of spheres and use\nits cohomology to give a proof of the classical result of Adams. We show that\nthere are natural transformations connecting the cohomology of the $K$-theory\nof spheres to the homotopy groups of spheres. There is a very close connection\nbetween the cohomology of the $K$-theory of the $4n$-dimensional spheres and\nthe homotopy groups of the $(4n-1)$-dimensional spheres.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a notion of the center and radius of a subset A\nof metric space X. In the Euclidean spaces, this notion can be seen as the\nextension of the center and radius of open/closed balls. The center and radius\nof a finite product of subsets of metric spaces, and a finite union of subsets\nof a metric space are also determined. For any subset A of metric space X,\nthere is a natural question to identify the open balls of X with the largest\nradius that are entirely contained in A. To answer this question, we introduce\na notion of quasi-center and quasi-radius of a subset A of metric space X. We\nprove that the center of the largest open balls contained in A belongs to the\nquasi-center of A, and its radius is equal to the quasi-radius of A. In\nparticular, for the Euclidean spaces, we see that the center of largest open\nballs contained in A belongs to the center of A, and its radius is equal to the\nradius of A.",

      "abstract": "The condition number of a smooth convex function, namely the ratio of its\nsmoothness to strong convexity constants, is closely tied to fundamental\nproperties of the function. In particular, the condition number of a quadratic\nconvex function is precisely the square of the diameter-to-width ratio of a\ncanonical ellipsoid associated to the function. Furthermore, the condition\nnumber of a function bounds the linear rate of convergence of the gradient\ndescent algorithm for unconstrained minimization.\n  We propose a condition number of a smooth convex function relative to a\nreference polytope. This relative condition number is defined as the ratio of a\nrelative smooth constant to a relative strong convexity constant of the\nfunction, where both constants are relative to the reference polytope. The\nrelative condition number extends the main properties of the traditional\ncondition number. In particular, we show that the condition number of a\nquadratic convex function relative to a polytope is precisely the square of the\ndiameter-to-facial-distance ratio of a scaled polytope for a canonical scaling\ninduced by the function. Furthermore, we illustrate how the relative condition\nnumber of a function bounds the linear rate of convergence of first-order\nmethods for minimization of the function over the polytope.",

The exocenter forms a boolean algebra and the central elements\nof the GPEA correspond to elements of a sublattice of the exocenter which forms\na generalized boolean algebra. We extend to GPEAs the notion of central\northocompleteness, prove that the exocenter of a centrally orthocomplete GPEA\n(COGPEA) is a complete boolean algebra and show that the sublattice\ncorresponding to the center is a complete boolean subalgebra. We also show that\nin a COGPEA, every element admits an exocentral cover and that the family of\nall exocentral covers, the so-called exocentral cover system, has the\nproperties of a hull system on a generalized effect algebra. We extend the\nnotion of type determining (TD) sets, originally introduced for effect algebras\nand then extended to GEAs and PEAs, to GPEAs, and prove a type-decomposition\ntheorem, analogous to the type decomposition of von Neumann algebras.",

      "abstract": "We describe a simple Monte Carlo simulation method to calculate the\nfree-energy cost of localizing a single monomer of a polymer confined to a\ncavity. The localization position is chosen to be on the inside surface of the\nconfining cavity. The method is applied to a freely-jointed hard-sphere polymer\nchain confined to cavities of spherical and cubic geometries. In the latter\ncase we consider localization at a corner and at the center of a face of the\nconfining cube. We consider cases of end-monomer localization both with and\nwithout tethering of the other end monomer to a point on the surface. We also\nexamine localization of monomers at arbitrary position along the contour of the\npolymer. We characterize the dependence of the free energy on the cavity size\nand shape, the localization position, and the polymer length. The quantitative\ntrends can be understood using standard scaling arguments and use of a simple\ntheoretical model. The results are relevant to those theories of polymer\ntranslocation that focus on the importance of the free-energy barrier as the\ntranslocation process requires an initial localization of a monomer to the\nposition of a nanopore.",

This approach leads to several results, which are illustrated here.\nAmong these are a new and more direct procedure for determining the exact form\nof the distribution of the mean, a correspondence between the distribution of\nthe mean and the parameter of a Dirichlet process, a characterization of the\nfamily of Cauchy distributions as the set of the fixed points of this\ncorrespondence, and an extension of the Markov-Krein identity. Moreover, an\nexpression of the characteristic function of the mean of a Dirichlet process is\nobtained by resorting to an integral representation of a confluent form of the\nfourth Lauricella function. This expression is then employed to prove that the\ndistribution of the mean of a Dirichlet process is symmetric if and only if the\nparameter of the process is symmetric, and to provide a new expression of the\nmoment generating function of the variance of a\n  Dirichlet process.",

The tour of a map along one of its\nspanning trees used by Bernardi may be generalized to hypermaps and we show\nthat it is equivalent to a dual tour described by Cori and Mach\\`\\i. We give a\nbijection between the spanning hypertrees of the reciprocal of the plane graph\nwith $2$ vertices and $n$ parallel edges and the meanders of order $n$ and a\nbijection of the same kind between semimeanders of order $n$ and spanning\nhypertrees of the reciprocal of a plane graph with a single vertex and $n/2$\nnested edges. We introduce hyperdeletions and hypercontractions in a hypermap\nwhich allow to count the spanning hypertrees of a hypermap recursively, and\ncreate a link with the computation of the Tutte polynomial of a graph. Having a\nparticular interest in hypermaps which are reciprocals of maps, we generalize\nthe reduction map introduced by Franz and Earnshaw to enumerate meanders to a\nreduction map that allows the enumeration of the spanning hypertrees of such\nhypermaps.",

Scientific contributions to the SWoT are many, and the diversity of\narchitectures in which they are expressed complicates comparison. To unify the\npresented architectures, we propose an architectural pattern, LMU-N.
