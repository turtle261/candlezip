A sufficient condition for the injective hull of a\n\n\ncritically compressible module to be critically compressible is also provided.\n\n\nFurthermore we prove sufficient conditions for a critically compressible module to be\n\n\ncontinuous. In addition, some characterization of critically compressible modules in\n\n\nterms of CS modules, nonsingular modules and cyclic modules are also provided.\n\n\n**Key Words: -** CS modules, continuous modules, uniform modules, compressible modules,\n\n\nself-similar modules, injective and quasi injective modules.\n\n\n(2000) Mathematics subject Classification: 16D50, 16D70, 16D80\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\nThroughout all rings have non-zero identity elements and all modules are unital\n\n\nright \ufffd\ufffd modules. Any terminology not defined hare may be found in McConnell\n\n\nand Robson [19] and Gooderl and field [18]. J. Zelmanowitz considered compressible\n\n\nmodules in detail in a series of papers [8, 9, 10, 11 and 12]. Zelmanowitz introduced\n\n\nthe concept of a weakly primitive ring as a ring having a faithful compressible\n\n\nmodule. Following [8] the right R-module M is called compressible if for each non\n\nzero submodule \ufffd of \ufffd, there exists a monomorphism \ufffd: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. In [13], author\n\n\nconsider a problem due to Zelmanowitz and study under what condition a uniform\n\n\n1\n\n\ncompressible module whose non-zero endomorphisms are monomorphisms is\n\n\ncritically compressible and they have provided positive answer to this problem for the\n\n\nclass of nonsingular modules, quasi-projective modules. In [13], it was proved that the\n\n\nconcepts of compressible and critically compressible modules are equivalent over\n\n\ncommutative rings or duo rings.\n\n\nZelmanowitz [8] claimed that a \u201ccompressible uniform module whose nonzero\n\n\nendomorphisms are monomorphisms would be critically compressible _\u201d_ . In [2] it was\n\n\nproved that for a commutative ring compressible and critically compressible modules\n\n\nare equivalent and the author called the above statement the \u201cZelmanowitz\n\n\nConjecture\u201d _._ Zelmanowitz also raises a question that under what conditions a\n\n\ncompressible uniform module whose non-zero endomorphisms are monomorphisms is\n\n\ncritically compressible.\n\n\nKhuri [14] introduced the notion of retractable modules (slightly compressible\n\n\nmodules) and gave some results for non-singular retractable modules when the\n\n\nendomorphism ring is (quasi-) continuous. Khuri considered retractable modules in\n\n\ndetails in series of papers [14, 15, and 16].\n\n\nThis paper is organized in two sections. In section 1 we give preliminary definitions\n\n\nand some results that help me to characterize critically compressible modules.\n\n\n**1. Preliminaries**\n\n\nThroughout this paper, it is assumed that R is an associative ring with an identity\n\n\nelement. Unless otherwise indicated modules are unitary left modules and\n\n\nhomomorphisms are written as right operators. If N is a submodule of M, we write N\n\n\n\u2264 M and if N is an essential submodule of M then we write N \ufffdM.\n\n\nNow we will list some definitions and results about critically compressible modules\n\n\nused in this paper.\n\n\n**Definition 1.1.** Let M be nonzero R-module. Then:\n\n\n2\n\n\n(1) M is called compressible if it can be embedded in each of its nonzero\n\n\nsubmodules.\n\n\n(2) M is called critically compressible if it is compressible and, additionally, it\n\n\ncannot be embedded in any of its proper factor modules.\n\n\n**Definition1.2.** A partial endomorphism of M is a homomorphism from a submodule\n\n\nof M into M.\n\n\n**Definition1.3.** An R-module M is called uniform if for every pair of non zero\n\n\nsubmodule N 1 and N 2, N 1 \uf0c7 N 2 \uf0b9 0. Clearly M will be uniform if every non zero\n\n\nsubmodule of M is essential submodule.\n\n\n**Example1.1.** If every nonzero partial endomorphism on M is monomorphism then M\n\n\nwill be uniform but converse is not true. For exp, Z (p [\u221e] ) is uniform Z-module. If we\n\n\ndefine f \uf0ce End z (Z (p [\u221e] )) by f ([x]) = [px]. Then f is nonzero but not monomorphism so,\n\n\nin Z (p [\u221e] ) every nonzero partial endomorphism is not monomorphism.\n\n\n**Definition1.4.** Given two R-module M and N, M is called N-injective if for every\n\n\nsubmodule N 1 of N, any homomorphism \u03b1 : N 1 \u2192 M can be extended to a\n\n\nhomomorphism \uf062 : N \u2192 M. M is called quasi injective if M is M \u2013 injective.\n\n\nConsider the following condition for a module M.\n\n\n(c 1 ) Every submodule of M is essential in a direct summand of M.\n\n\n(c 2 ) If a submodule of M is isomorphic to a direct summand of M, then it is itself a\n\n\ndirect summand of M.\n\n\n(c 3 ) If A & B are direct summand of M with A \uf0c7 B = 0 then A + B is also a direct\n\n\nsummand of M.\n\n\nM is called CS module (extending module) if it satisfies (C 1 ). M is called\n\n\ncontinuous module if it satisfies C 1 & C 2 and quasi continuous if it satisfies C 1 & C 3 .\n\n\n**Definition1.5.** A nonzero R-module M is called self similar if every non zero\n\n\nsubmodule of M is isomorphic to M.\n\n\n3\n\n\n**Definition1.6.** An R-module M is said to be rational extension of M 1, in case for each\n\n\nsubmodule B, M \uf0ca B \uf0ca M 1, f \uf0ce Hom (B, M) satisfies f(M 1 )  = 0 if and only if f = 0.\n\n\nThe injective hull of M denoted by E (M).\n\n\n**Proposition1.1.** [7, Prop.1.1] The following conditions are equivalent for a\n\n\ncompressible module M:\n\n\n(1) M is critically compressible;\n\n\n(2) Every non-zero partial endomorphism on M is monomorphism.\n\n\nAn R-module M is called polyform if every essential submodule of M is dense in M\n\n\nand M is called if every submodule of M is essential. An R-module M is slightly\n\n\ncompressible if \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd0 for every non-zero submodule X of M. Clearly\n\n\nevery compressible module is slightly compressible module\n\n\n**Proposition1.2.** If every non-zero endomorphism of a slightly compressible module\n\n\nM is monomorphism, then M is compressible.\n\n\nSince every endomorphism of M is also a partial endomorphism of M, then\n\n\nProposition1.1 can be re-written as;\n\n\n**Proposition1.3.** Let M is slightly compressible R-module. The following conditions\n\n\nare equivalent:\n\n\n(i) M is critically compressible;\n\n\n(ii) Every non-zero partial endomorphism of M is monomorphism.\n\n\n**2. Compressible and Critically compressible modules**\n\n\nIn this section, we are giving some useful results concerning critically compressible\n\n\nand compressible modules.\n\n\n**Proposition2.1.** Every compressible module over a commutative ring R is torsion\n\n\nfree.\n\n\n**Proof:** Since every compressible module over commutative ring is critically\n\n\ncompressible, then every non zero partial endomorphism on M is monomorphism.\n\n\n4\n\n\nTake any nonzero partial endomorphism on M. f \uf061 : M \uf0ae M. Suppose M is not torsion\n\n\nfree. Take a torsion element x \uf0ce M. \uf061\uf0b9 o \uf0ce R then \uf061 x=0 Now define f \uf061 (x) = \uf061 x is\n\n\nhomomorphism then f \uf061 (x) = 0 = \uf061 x \uf0de x \uf0ce Ker f, but due to critically\n\n\nCompressibility of M, f \uf061 will be monomorphism, then x=0 which is a contradiction.\n\n\nTherefore M is torsion free.\n\n\n**Proposition2.2.** Let M be compressible module. If M is cyclic and torsion free then\n\n\nM will be critically compressible.\n\n\n**Proof:** Let N be any nonzero submodule of M and f be any non zero partial\n\n\nendomorphism from N to M. Then f (n) \uf0b9 0 for some o \uf0b9 n \uf0ce N. Since otherwise f (N)\n\n\n= f (Rn) = 0, a contradiction. Now let \uf061 n \uf0ce Kerf \uf0de f ( \uf061 n) = 0 \uf0de \uf061 f (n) = 0 since M is\n\n\ntorsion free and f (n) \uf0b9 0 \uf0de Kerf = 0 Hence every nonzero partial endomorphism on\n\n\nM is monomorphism. Then M is critically compressible.\n\n\n**Proposition2.3.** If R be a torsion free ring with unity then R [R] is compressible module\n\n\nif and only if R [R] it is critically compressible module.\n\n\n**Proof:** Let R [R] is compressible module. Now R=R.1, then R is cyclic. Since R is also\n\n\nTorsion free. Then from Prop. 2.2, R [R] is critically compressible, converse is obvious.\n\n\n**Proposition2.4.** Every critically compressible module M is indecomposable.\n\n\n**Proof:** Suppose M = M 1 \uf0c5 M 2 with 0 \uf0b9 M 1, M 2 \uf0b9 M. Let p i be the projection map\n\n\nfrom M to M i for i = 1, 2. Due to compressibility of M, p i is monomorphism then Ker\n\n\np i =m j = 0 for i \uf0b9 j which is a contradiction Hence M is indecomposable.\n\n\n**Proposition2.5.** Let M be a compressible module. Then every indecomposable\n\n\ninjective module M whose nonzero partial endomorphism have uniform non singular\n\n\nkernels then M will be critically compressible.\n\n\n**Proof:** Let N be a nonzero submodule of M. Now Let f : N \uf0ae M be any non zero\n\n\npartial endomorphism on M. suppose Ker f \uf0b9 0 since Ker f is uniform, N = Ker f [by\n\n\n2, Prop. 2.2] then N is non singular. Therefore N is rational extension of Ker f [by 3,\n\n\n5\n\n\nProp 5, p. 59]. Hence f (Kerf) = 0 \uf0de f = 0 which is a contradiction. Hence Ker f = 0\n\n\nthen every non zero partial endomorphism on M is monomorphism. Then M is\n\n\ncritically compressible.\n\n\n**Proposition2.6.** Every critically compressible module is CS (extending module) and\n\n\nit is continuous if and only if every partial monomorphism is isomorphism.\n\n\n**Proof:** Let M be a critically compressible module. Then every non zero partial\n\n\nendomorphism on M is monomorphism. So M is uniform. Hence every critically\n\n\ncompressible module is CS module (extending module).\n\n\nLet f : M \uf0ae M be any non zero partial endomorphism on M. Due to critically\n\n\ncompressibility of M, f will be monomorphism. Suppose f is not surjective then f (M)\n\n\nC M and f (M) will be proper essential submodule of M. Now define g : M \uf0ae f (M)\n\n\nby g (x) = f (x), then g is isomorphism. Since M is continuous, f (M) being on\n\n\nisomorphic copy of M cannot be a proper essential submodule of M, a contradiction.\n\n\nHence f is surjective. Converse is obvious.\n\n\nWe note that, every non-zero submodule of compressible or critically compressible\n\n\nmodule is also compressible or critically compressible module respectively.\n\n\nIt is clear that if E(M) is compressible or critically compressible then M is also\n\n\ncompressible or critically compressible module respectively. Now we are giving\n\n\nsufficient condition for an injective hull of compressible or critically compressible\n\n\nmodule to be compressible or critically compressible.\n\n\n**Proposition2.7.** Let M is a critically compressible then E(M) will be critically\n\n\ncompressible if\n\n\n(1) M is stable under partial endomorphism of E (M)\n\n\n(2) E (M) is rational extension of M.\n\n\n**Proof:** Let M is critically compressible. Now suppose M [1] be any non zero submodule\n\n\nof E (M) and h : M [1] \uf0ae E (M) be any zero partial endomorphism on E (M). Suppose\n\n\n6\n\n\nKer h \uf0b9 0. Then Ker h will be submodule of E (M) \uf0de M \uf0c7 Ker h \uf0b9 0. Now f = h/N is\n\n\nany non zero partial endomorphism on M. Since M is stable under endomorphism of\n\n\nE (M). Also f \u2260 0 since E (M) is rational extension of M. Thus Ker f = Kerh \uf0c7 M \u2260 0\n\n\nwhich is a contradiction. Hence E (M) is critically compressible.\n\n\nNow if M is non-singular then rational extension of M and injective hull of M\n\n\ncoincides and this leads immediately to the following.\n\n\n**Corollary2.8.** Let M and E (M) be compressible module and M be nonsingular\n\n\nmodule stable under partial endomorphism of E (M). Then E(M) is critically\n\n\ncompressible module if and only if M is compressible module.\n\n\nA ring with unit 1 is said to be an S.P. ring if Z (M) is a direct summand of M for\n\n\nevery R-module M, where Z (M) = {x \uf0ce M \uf0ea R \uf044 0 (x)}, 0 (x) denotes the annihilator\n\n\nideal of x. _In_ [7] author claimed that if M is compressible module then M is singular\n\n\nor nonsingular. Now we are giving here the result that for a S.P. ring every critically\n\n\ncompressible module is either singular or nonsingular.\n\n\n**Proposition2.9.** Let R be a S.P. ring. Then any critically compressible module over R\n\n\nis either singular or non singular.\n\n\n**Proof.** Let M is neither singular nor non singular, then Z (M) is a non zero direct\n\n\nsummand and proper submodule of M. Now by prop. 2.4 M is indecomposable Hence\n\n\nZ (M) = M, a contradiction. Hence M is either singular or non singular.\n\n\n**Proposition2.10.** A ring R with unit 1 \u2260 0 is self similar and in which every non zero\n\n\nendomorphism is monomorphism if and only if it is a principal ideal ring without\n\n\nzero divisor.\n\n\n**Proof.** Assume R is self similar and in which every non zero endomorphism is\n\n\nmonomorphism. Then R has no zero divisor. To prove R is a principal ideal ring, Let\n\n\nS be any non zero ideal of R. Take \uf061\uf0ce R, r \uf0b9 0 then there exist a isomorphism f : R \uf0ae\n\n\n7\n\n\nRr and g : Rr \uf0ae S. Let  f (1) = xr and g (xr) = b, Now if y \uf0ce S then y = g of (a) for\n\n\nsome a \uf0ce R\n\n\ny=g o f (a.1)\n\n\n= g (a f(1))\n\n\n= a g (xr) = ab \uf0ce R\n\n\nHence, S = Rb is a principal ideal.\n\n\nThe converse is obvious.\n\n\n**Corollary2.11.** If R is a principal ideal ring without zero divisor then R [R] is critically\n\n\ncompressible.\n\n\n**Proof.** If R is Principal ideal ring without zero divisor then R is self similar in which\n\n\nevery non zero endomorphism is monomorphism (By prop. 2.10). Then from [1,\n\n\nthereon 4.1], R [R] is critically compressible.\n\n\nHence the following implications hold :\n\n\n_R is self similar in which every non zero endomorphism is monomorphism_ \uf0de\n\n\n_R is a principal ideal ring without zero divisor_ \uf0de _R_ _[R]_ _is critically compressible._\n\n\n**Proposition 2.12.** Let M be compressible module and every non zero f \uf0ce Hom R (M,\n\n\nM\u2019) is monomorphism, where M\u2019 is quasi injective hull of M. Then M is critically\n\n\ncompressible module.\n\n\n**Proof.** Let g : N \uf0ae M be any non zero partial endomorphism on M. Such that f \uf0bd N = g\n\n\nby assumption f is monomorphism and so g is monomorphism. Hence every non zero\n\n\npartial endomorphism on M is monomorphism. Then M is critically compressible.\n\n\n**Proposition2.13.** Let R be a noetherian ring and R be a module over ring R. Then\n\n\nfollowing conditions are equivalent:\n\n\n(i) R [R] is compressible module\n\n\n(ii) R [R] is critically compressible\n\n\n(iii) Monomorphism R (R, U) is non zero for every uniform submodule U of R.\n\n\n8\n\n\n(iv) Monomorphism R (R, U) is non zero for every cyclic uniform submodule U\n\n\nof R.\n\n\n**Proof.** (1) \uf0de (2) from [1, theorem 3.2]\n\n\n(2) \uf0de (3) \uf0de (4)  is clear.\n\n\nNow (4) \uf0de (1)\n\n\nLet N be any non zero submodule of R. Let m be any non zero element of N.\n\n\nBy hypothesis mR is noetherian and hence mR contains a uniform submodule U of R.\n\n\nLet u be any non zero element of U. Then uR is cyclic uniform submodule of R. By\n\n\n(4) mono R (R, UR) is non zero. Hence mono R (R, N) is non zero. Hence R [R] is\n\n\ncompressible module.\n\n\n**References:-**\n\n\n1.
