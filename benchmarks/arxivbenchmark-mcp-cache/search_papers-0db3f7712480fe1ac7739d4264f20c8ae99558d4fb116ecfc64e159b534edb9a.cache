      "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the theory of aftershocks. The history of discovery\nof the Omori law is briefly described, the initial formulation of the law is\ngiven in the form of an algebraic formula describing the decrease in the\nfrequency of aftershocks over time. An important generalization of the Oiori\nformula which is widely used in modern seismology is presented. The generalized\nlaw is also expressed by an algebraic formula, but it contains an additional\nparameter, which makes it possible to more flexibly approximate the\nobservational data. The alternative approach to the theoretical description of\naftershocks is to use the differential evolution models. To simulate the\naveraged dynamics of aftershocks, it is proposed the Verhulst differential\nequation, also known as the logistic equation. It is shown that the decrease in\nthe frequency of aftershocks with time at the first stage of evolution occurs\naccording to the Omori hyperbola, i.e. in accordance with the original wording\nof the law. The paper also proposes a stochastic generalization of the equation\nfor the evolution of aftershocks. A random function of time is added to the\nright-hand side of the logistic equation to simulate noise that affects a\ndynamic system. As a result, a stochastic Langevin equation was obtained, which\ncan be used to simulate fluctuations in the frequency of aftershocks.",

      "abstract": "The condition number of a smooth convex function, namely the ratio of its\nsmoothness to strong convexity constants, is closely tied to fundamental\nproperties of the function. In particular, the condition number of a quadratic\nconvex function is precisely the square of the diameter-to-width ratio of a\ncanonical ellipsoid associated to the function. Furthermore, the condition\nnumber of a function bounds the linear rate of convergence of the gradient\ndescent algorithm for unconstrained minimization.\n  We propose a condition number of a smooth convex function relative to a\nreference polytope. This relative condition number is defined as the ratio of a\nrelative smooth constant to a relative strong convexity constant of the\nfunction, where both constants are relative to the reference polytope. The\nrelative condition number extends the main properties of the traditional\ncondition number. In particular, we show that the condition number of a\nquadratic convex function relative to a polytope is precisely the square of the\ndiameter-to-facial-distance ratio of a scaled polytope for a canonical scaling\ninduced by the function. Furthermore, we illustrate how the relative condition\nnumber of a function bounds the linear rate of convergence of first-order\nmethods for minimization of the function over the polytope.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we study the property of normality of a number in base 2. A\nsimple rule that associates a vector to a number is presented and the property\nof normality is stated for the vector associated to the number. The problem of\ntesting a number for normality is shown to be equivalent to the test of\ngeometrical properties of the associated vector. The paper provides a general\napproach for normality testing and then applies the proposed methodology to the\nstudy of particular numbers. The main result of the paper is to prove that an\ninfinite class of numbers is normal in base 2. As a further result we prove\nthat the irrational number $\\sqrt{2}$ is normal in base 2.",

      "abstract": "Consider a non-negative number $t$ and a hyperplane $H$ of $\\mathbb{R}^d$\nwhose distance to the center of the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ is $t$. If $t$ is equal\nto $0$ and $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$, it is known that the\n$(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\\cap[0,1]^d$ is a strictly increasing function\nof $d$ when $d$ is at least $3$. The study of the monotonicity of this volume\nis extended for $t$ up to above $1/2$ and, when $d$ is large enough, for every\nnon-negative $t$. In particular, a range for $t$ is identified such that this\nvolume is a strictly decreasing function of $d$ over the positive integers. The\nlocal extremality of the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\\cap[0,1]^d$ when $H$\nis orthogonal to a diagonal of either $[0,1]^d$ or a lower dimensional face is\nalso determined for the same values of $t$. It is shown for instance that when\n$t$ is above an explicit constant and $d$ is large enough, this volume is\nalways strictly locally maximal when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of\n$[0,1]^d$. A precise estimate for the convergence rate of the Eulerian numbers\nto their limit Gaussian behavior is provided along the way.",

A diagram\nof algebras is a functor from a small category to some category of algebras.\nFor an appropriate category of algebras we get a diagram of groups, a diagram\nof Lie algebras, a diagram of commutative rings, etc.\n  We define the cohomology of diagrams of algebras using comonads. The\ncohomology of diagrams of algebras classifies extensions in the category of\nfunctors. Our main result is that there is a spectral sequence connecting the\ncohomology of the diagram of algebras to the cohomology of the members of the\ndiagram.\n  $\\Psi$-rings can be thought of as functors from the category with one object\nassociated to the multiplicative monoid of the natural numbers to the category\nof commutative rings. So we can apply the theory we developed for the diagrams\nof algebras to the case of $\\Psi$-rings. Our main result tells us that there is\na spectral sequence connecting the cohomology of the $\\Psi$-ring to the\nAndr\\'{e}-Quillen cohomology of the underlying commutative ring.\n  The main example of a $\\lambda$-ring or a $\\Psi$-ring is the $K$-theory of a\ntopological space. We look at the example of the $K$-theory of spheres and use\nits cohomology to give a proof of the classical result of Adams. We show that\nthere are natural transformations connecting the cohomology of the $K$-theory\nof spheres to the homotopy groups of spheres. There is a very close connection\nbetween the cohomology of the $K$-theory of the $4n$-dimensional spheres and\nthe homotopy groups of the $(4n-1)$-dimensional spheres.",

      "abstract": "The polarization charge $\\rho $ of an inhomogeneous superfluid system is\nexpressed as a function of the order parameter $\\Phi\n({{\\mathbf{r}}_{1}},{{\\mathbf{r}}_{2}})$.

It is\nfound that a vortex in a superfluid film creates an electric potential above\nthe film.

      "abstract": "A spin (dependent) system treatment of gravity is adopted akin to the\nSen-Ashtekar treatment. Time is reinserted into the space ``fluid'' at the\nquantum Level. This time - the Lorentzian one- is shown to be a vorticity of a\n``fluid particle'' of the space and the effect is integrated over all the fluid\nparticles to incorporate time in quantum gravity. This spacetime is viewed as a\nfluid of future light cones called the SU(2) dipoles of causality here in the\npaper.The future light cone structure is soldered internally to the new\nvariables derived in this paper to accomodate a background free physics of\nquantum strings. The emergence of spacetime is shown to be a first order phase\ntransition and that of separation of gravity from the unified field to be a\nsecond order phase transition. For the former case the cosmic time is chosen as\nthe order parameter and for the latter case the angular momentum is chosen as\nthe order parameter. A quantum blackhole thus nucleates at transition\ntemperature which is the Planck temperature, $\\tau_{pl}$. Then the SU(2)\ndipoles enable interpretation of this black hole as a gravity gauge\nSL(2,$\\mathbb{C}$) dual of the U(1) gauge ferromagnetic phase. The usual QFT\ninterpretation of this effect is the existence of locally Lorentzian\nspacetimes.",
