Guglielmi\n\n\n_Schmidt Institute of Physics of the Earth, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia_\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nThis paper is devoted to the theory of aftershocks. The history of discovery of the Omori law\nis briefly described, the initial formulation of the law is given in the form of an algebraic formula\ndescribing the decrease in the frequency of aftershocks over time. An important generalization of the\nOiori formula which is widely used in modern seismology is presented. The generalized law is also\nexpressed by an algebraic formula, but it contains an additional parameter, which makes it possible\nto more flexibly approximate the observational data. The alternative approach to the theoretical\ndescription of aftershocks is to use the differential evolution models. To simulate the averaged\ndynamics of aftershocks, it is proposed the Verhulst differential equation, also known as the logistic\nequation. It is shown that the decrease in the frequency of aftershocks with time at the first stage of\nevolution occurs according to the Omori hyperbola, i.e. in accordance with the original wording of\nthe law. The paper also proposes a stochastic generalization of the equation for the evolution of\naftershocks. A random function of time is added to the right-hand side of the logistic equation to\nsimulate noise that affects a dynamic system. As a result, a stochastic Langevin equation was\nobtained, which can be used to simulate fluctuations in the frequency of aftershocks.\n\n\n**Keywords:** earthquake, Omori law, differential model, deactivation coefficient, logistic equation,\nLangevin equation, nonstationarity, fluctuations of seismicity.\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\nThe repeated tremors called aftershocks occur in the epicentral zone after a strong earthquake\n\n[Kasahara, 1981]. For the first time the law of evolution of the aftershocks was formulated by\nFusakichi Omori. This outstanding event took place 127 years ago [Omori, 1984]. It is appropriate\nto tell a little about the history of this discovery [Davison, 1924, 1930; Utsu, Ogata, Matsu'ura,\n1995; Guglielmi, 2017].\n\n\n1\n\n\nIn 1880, John Milne, one of the founders of modern seismology, has created the horizontal\npendulum seismograph, an easy-to-use and sensitive enough device for recording earthquakes.\nWhile Milne worked in Tokyo at the invitation of the Government of the Japanese Empire. In 1887\nMilne was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He manages to convince the Royal\nSociety to allocate funds for the creation of a global network of seismic stations equipped with his\ninstruments. (By the way, the three stations Milne decided to place in Russia.) Fusakichi Omori was\na student of John Milne. He enjoyed the encouraging support of his teacher, like all the young\nJapanese seismologists of the time. An earthquake with magnitude of M = 8 occurred on October\n28, 1891. Milne's seismographs have recorded numerous aftershocks. The analysis of aftershocks\nallowed Omori to formulate the law that bears his name [Omori, 1984]. He was then 26 years old.\n\n\nAt the end of a small excursion into history, it is worth mentioning that Japan appreciated the\nmerits Milne before the country and the world. Emperor Meiji awarded him the Order of the Rising\nSun and awarded him a life pension, and the University of Tokyo elected him the honorary\nprofessor.\n\n\nOmori law states that after a strong earthquake the frequency of aftershocks\n\n\n_k_\n### n t \uf028\uf029 \uf03d    (1)\n\n_c_ \uf02b _t_\n\n#### on average hyperbolically decreases with time. Here the parameter k \uf03e 0 characterizes the event,\n### t \uf0b3 0, and the parameter c \uf03e 0 being determined by the choice of the initial condition n \uf028\uf029 0 [Omori,\n\n\n1984]. 127 years after the discovery of the law, the modeling of the evolution of aftershocks has\nalready become a fairly established field, in which a large volume and rich in interesting content\nobservational material has been accumulated which generally confirms the Omori law.\n\n\nAn important stage in the development of this area began after the publications [Utsu, 1957,\n1961] (see also reviews [Utsu, Ogata, Matsu'ura, 1995; Guglielmi, 2017]). Utsu showed that the\n\nformula\n\n\n\n_k_\n_n t_ \uf03d\n### \uf028\uf029 p\n\n\n\n\uf03d\n### \uf028\uf029\n\n_c_ \uf02b _t_\n### \uf028 \uf029\n\n\n\n\uf03d\n\n_c_ \uf02b _t_\n\n\n\n. (2)\n\n\n\n\uf02b\n\n\n\nbetter approximates observational data than formula (1). Here _p_ is some fitting parameter. It should\n\nbe noted that formula (2) was considered earlier in papers [Hirano, 1924; Jeffreys, 1938], but only\nUtsu fully appreciated its capabilities for flexible modeling of the evolution of aftershocks.\n\n\nFormula (2) is widely used in the quantitative description of aftershocks. To date, extensive\ninformation has been accumulated on the _k_ and _p_ parameters for specific events that have occurred\n\nin many seismically active regions of the planet. Here is a far from complete list of relevant works\n\n[Adams, Le Fort, 1963; Page, 1968; Usami, 1975; McGarr, Green, 1978; Iio, 1984; Ogata, 1994;\nKocharyan, Spivak, 2003; Kanamori, Brodsky, 2004; Rodkin, 2008; Narteau et al. 2009; Baranov,\nChebrov, 2012; Romashkova, Kosobokov, 2012; Saltykov, Droznina, 2014; Sobolev, 2015; Goda,\n\n\n2\n\n\n2015; Zotov, Zavyalov., Klain, 2020]. Of particular interest is the variability of the parameter _p_ . It\n\n\nvaries from case to case, but the average over the set of many measurements is quite close to unity.\n\n\nIn this paper, we try to find an another approach to the problem of the evolution of\naftershocks. Namely, instead of choosing an algebraic formula for approximating observations, we\nwill try to find simple differential equations describing evolution. For example, it is quite obvious\nthat the Omori's law (1) is equivalent to the truncated Bernoulli equation\n\n\n2\n### n \uf02b\uf073 n \uf03d 0 .      (3) Here, the dot over the symbol denotes time differentiation, and \uf073\uf03d 1/ k is the so-called\n\ndeactivation coefficient of the earthquake source [Guglitlmi, 2016]. The advantage of the simple\ndifferential model (3) compared with the algebraic formula (1) consists in the fact that the\n### deactivation coefficient \uf073 \uf028\uf029 t can be considered time-dependent in order to take into account the\n\n\nnon-stationary of rocks in the source, \u201ccooling down\u201d after the main earthquake shock. In this case,\nthe solution of equation (3) takes the form\n\n\n\n\uf0e9 _t_ \uf0a2 \uf0a2\uf0f9 \uf02d\n# \uf03d n 0 \uf0ea 1 \uf02b n 0 \uf0f2 \uf073 \uf028\uf029 t dt \uf0fa .     (4)\n\n\uf0eb 0 \uf0fb\n\n\n\n_t_\n\n\n\uf0a2\n\n_n t_ \uf03d _n_ 1 \uf02b _n_ \uf073 _t dt_\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\uf0a2\n\uf03d _n_ 1 \uf02b _n_ \uf073\n### \uf028\uf029 0 \uf0ea 0 \uf028\uf029\n\n\n\n1 \uf02b _n_\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n0 0\n\n\n## Note that formula (1) is a special case of expression (4) and can be obtained from it at \uf073\uf03d const .\n\nThe formulation of Omori's law in the form of a differential equation suggests possible\ngeneralizations of the theory. Two generalizations are proposed below. One of them has the form of\nthe logistic Verhulst equation, and the second formally coincides with the stochastic Langevin\nequation. The logistic equation models the averaged dynamics of aftershocks. Stochastic\ngeneralization is of interest in describing not only averaged evolution, but also fluctuations of\n\naftershocks.\n\n\n**Evolution equation**\n\n\nIn the paper [Faraoni, 2020] attention is drawn to the fact that equation (3) can be considered\nas the Euler-Lagrange equation of some dynamic system. The corresponding Lagrangian has the\n\nform\n\n\n2 2 5\n### L n n \uf028, \uf029 \uf03d nn \uf02b\uf073 n .      (5)\n\n\nAs is known, the Lagrange theory is based on the fundamental laws of Newtonian\nmechanics. In many specific tasks these laws allow us to choose one or another form of the\nLagrangian. For obvious reason it is practically impossible to find the Lagrangian based on first\n\n\n3\n\n\nprinciples in our case. The theory of aftershocks is purely phenomenological [Guglielmi, Klain,\n2020]. Therefore, if we try to formulate it on the basis of the Euler-Lagrange equation, then the form\nof the Lagrangian must be guessed guided by observation data and indirect considerations.\n\n\nLet us focus on the development of the theory of aftershocks in the direction indicated by\nValerio Faraoni. Let us pay attention to the fact that Lagrangian (5), from which (3) follows, has an\n### unusual structure. This structure suggests that L n n \uf028,  is represented as a series in odd powers of \uf029 n .\n\n\nWhen searching for a more general theory is natural to try first of all to restore the cubic term of the\nform \uf067 2 _n_ 3, which is missing in (5). After some trial and error the following Lagrangian was chosen:\n\n### L n n \uf028, \uf029 \uf03d n n \uf0e9 2 \uf02b n 2 \uf028 \uf067 \uf02d\uf073 n \uf029 2 \uf0f9   (6)\n\n\uf0eb \uf0fb [. ]\n\n### It is seen that (6) transforms into the Faraoni Lagrangian (5) at \uf067\uf03d 0 .\n\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation\n\n\n\uf0b6 _L_ _d_ \uf0b6 _L_\n\uf02d \uf03d 0 (7)\n\uf0b6 _n_ _dt_ \uf0b6 _n_\n\n\nwith the new Lagrangian (6) becomes\n\n\n_n_ \uf03d _n_ ( \uf067 \uf02d\uf073 _n_ ) . (8)\n\nWe got the Verhulst equation, or, as it is also called, the logistic equation [Verhulst, 1838]. It is\nwidely used in biology, chemistry, astrophysics, and other sciences, including economics and\nsociology. Let us show that the logistic equation can also be useful in the physics of earthquakes.\n\n\nThe solution of equation (8) is the so-called logistic curve. It consists of two branches. Recall\nthe form of the branch of the logistic curve, which is widely used in various sections of science. This\nis a monotonically increasing function of time. When _t_ \uf0ae\uf02d\uf0a5 function asymptotically approach\n\nzero, and when _t_ \uf0ae\uf02b\uf0a5 it seeks from the bottom to saturation at the _n_ \uf0a5 [\uf03d] \uf067\uf073 / level. This behavior\n\n\nis not characteristic of aftershoks.\n\n\nThe second branch, the existence of which is not so widely known, is entirely located above\nthe saturation level and is a monotonically decreasing function of time. When _t_ \uf0ae\uf02b\uf0a5 it tends\nasymptotically from above the saturation level. It is this branch that is of interest for the theory of\n\naftershocks.\n\n\nWe pose the Cauchy problem for the logistic equation. The selection of one or another\nbranch is carried out by choosing the initial condition. We will set the initial condition _n_ \uf03d _n_ 0 at\n\n#### t \uf03d 0 and will look for solutions at t \uf03e 0 . It is easy to show that for [n] 0 \uf03c n \uf0a5 ( n \uf0a5 [\uf03c] n 0 ) solution of the\n\n\nproblem will be lower (upper) branch of the logistic curve. Thus, when setting the Cauchy problem\nin the physics of aftershocks, the initial condition should be asked the additional restriction _[n]_ 0 \uf03e _n_ \uf0a5 .\n\n\nMoreover, it is quite appropriate to use a strong inequality\n\n\n4\n\n\n_n_ 0 \uf03e\uf03e _n_ \uf0a5 \uf03d \uf067\uf073 / . (9)\n\n\nIndeed, when _t_ \uf0ae\uf0a5 the frequency of aftershocks asymptotically approaches to the background\n\n(equilibrium) value _n_ \uf0a5 . Experience shows that as a rule after a strong earthquake _[n]_ 0 \uf03e\uf03e _n_ \uf0a5 .\n\n\nLet us show that the decrease in the frequency of aftershocks with time, which generally\nproceeds along the upper branch of the logistic function, at the first stage of evolution occurs\n## according to the Omori hyperbola, i.e. in accordance with formula (4) at \uf073\uf03d const . It is natural to\n\ncall this stage of evolution the Omori epoch.\n\n### Let us assume for simplicity that \uf067 \uf03d const, n \uf0a5 \uf03d const, introduce the notation\n\n\n\n\uf03d 1 ln 1 \uf0e6\uf0e7 \uf02d _n_ \uf0a5 \uf0f6\uf0f7\n\n\uf067 \uf0e8 _n_ 0 \uf0f8\n\n\n\n1 _n_\n_t_ \uf0a5 \uf03d ln 1 \uf0e7 \uf02d\n\uf067 \uf0e8 _n_\n\n\n\n\uf0a5 \uf03d ln 1 \uf0e7 \uf02d \uf0a5\n\n\n\n, (10)\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nand write the solution of evolution equation (8) in the following form:\n\n\n\n\uf02d 1\n## n t \uf028\uf029 \uf03d n \uf0a5 \uf07b 1 exp \uf02d \uf0e9\uf067 \uf028 t \uf0a5 \uf02d t \uf029 \uf0f9 \uf07d\n\n\n## \uf028\uf029 \uf03d n \uf0a5 \uf07b 1 exp \uf02d \uf0e9\uf0eb\uf067 \uf028 t \uf0a5 \uf02d t \uf029 \uf0f9\uf0fb \uf07d\n\n\n\n\uf02d\n\n\n\n\uf02d\n## \uf03d n \uf0a5 \uf07b 1 exp \uf02d \uf0e9\uf0eb\uf067 \uf028 t \uf0a5 \uf02d t \uf029 \uf0f9\uf0fb \uf07d .        (11)\n\n\n\nIn the Omori epoch _t_ \uf0a5 [\uf03c] _t_ 1/ \uf067 and respectively\n\n### n t \uf028\uf029 \uf03d 1/ \uf073 \uf028 t \uf02d t \uf0a5 \uf029 .  (12)\n\n\nFormula (12) coincides with the classical Omori formula (1) up to notation.\n\n\nObservational experience indirectly testifies to the plausibility of our logistic model. It is\nknown for example that over time the frequency _n_ tends not to zero, as follows from the Omori law,\n\nbut to some equilibrium value _n_ \uf0a5 .\n\n\nWe presented an idealized picture of the evolution of aftershocks. In reality the frequency of\nexcitation of aftershocks is influenced by many factors that are difficult to control. We mentioned\nabove the nonstationarity of the geological environment in the source. Among other causes of\ndeviation from the ideal picture it is necessary to highlight the impact of endogenous and exogenous\ntriggers on the earthquake source. These include free oscillations of the Earth excited by the main\nshock [Guglielmi, Zotov, 2012; Guglielmi, 2015a], round-the-world seismic echo [Guglielmi,\n2015b], seismic noises in the source, and others [Zavyalov, Guglielmi, Zotov, 2020].\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\nWe want to discuss the issue of a stochastic generalization of the evolution equation. Let's\n### change the variable n t \uf028\uf029 \uf0ae\uf06a \uf028\uf029 t \uf03d 1/ n t \uf028\uf029, rewrite equation (8) in the form\n\n\n5\n\n\n\uf06a \uf03d \uf073 \uf02d\uf067\uf06a, (13)\n\n### and add the function \uf078 \uf028\uf029 t to the right-hand side: \uf06a \uf03d \uf073 \uf02d\uf067\uf06a\uf02b\uf078 \uf028\uf029 t .     (14)\n\n\nLet us formally solve this equation\n\n\n_t_\n# \uf06a \uf028\uf029 t \uf03d\uf06a \uf0a5 \uf02b \uf028 \uf06a 0 \uf02d\uf06a \uf0a5 \uf029 exp \uf028 \uf02d\uf067 t \uf029 \uf02b \uf0f2 \uf078 \uf028\uf029 t 1 exp \uf0e9\uf0eb\uf067 \uf028 t 1 \uf02d t \uf029 \uf0f9\uf0fb dt 1 .      (15)\n\n0\n\n### Here \uf06a \uf0a5 [\uf03d] \uf073\uf067 /, \uf06a 0 \uf03d\uf06a \uf028\uf029 0 . We will consider \uf078 \uf028\uf029 t the random delta-correlated function with zero\n\n\naverage value, i.e. we put\n\n### \uf078 \uf028\uf029 t \uf03d 0, \uf078 \uf028\uf029\uf028\uf029 t \uf078 t 1 \uf03d 2 D \uf064 \uf028 t \uf02d t 1 \uf029,    (16)\n\n\nwhere the line from above means averaging. Now equation (14) should be considered as the\nLangevin stochastic equation [Klimontovich, 1982]. The new phenomenological parameter _D_ is\ndetermined by the intensity of noise affecting our dynamic system.\n\n\nSo, the relaxation of the earthquake source after the main shock is manifested in a sequence\nof aftershocks, the frequency of which decreases with time. Observational experience shows that a\nparticular sequence is characterized by a unique combination of numerous properties. One of the\nimportant tasks of the theory is to compact display the variety of properties in the form of a small set\nof phenomenological parameters. We see that the logistic evolution model contains two parameters,\n\n\uf073 and \uf067 . In the Langevin model the third parameter _D_ is added to this set. Let us consider how\n\nthese parameters can be estimated practically from the observation of aftershocks.\n\n\nThe most reliable is the deactivation coefficient in the Omori epoch: \uf073 \uf03d _d_ \uf06a / _dt_ .\n\n\nConsiderable experience has already been accumulated in measuring \uf073, and some connection\nbetween \uf073 and the magnitude of the main earthquake shock was noticed (see [Zavyalov, Guglielmi,\n\nZotov, 2020] and the literature cited therein). A rough estimate of the parameter \uf067 can be made\n\n\nusing the formula \uf067 \uf073\uf06a / \uf0a5 . As for the _D_ parameter, the procedure for its measurement has yet to\n\n\nbe developed. The general idea is that _D_ can be expressed in terms of \uf067 and the dispersion of the\n\naftershock frequency (see, for example, [Klimontovich, 1982]).\n\n\nExperimental study of variations in phenomenological parameters can enrich the physics of\naftershocks. The variation of the deactivation coefficient is of particular interest. In the Omori\n\n\nepoch, the _d_ \uf06a / _dt_ is constant by definition. From a theoretical point of view, at the end of the\n\n\nOmori epoch, the _d_ \uf06a / _dt_ value monotonically decreases and tends to zero at _t_ \uf0ae\uf0a5 . Experience\n\n\n6\n\n\nhowever shows that sometimes the value _d_ \uf06a / _dt_ \uf03d 0 is reached at _t_ \uf03d _t_ _c_, i.e. over a finite time\n\n\ninterval [Zavyalov, Guglielmi, Zotov, 2020]. Analysis of the evolution equation indicates a phase\n\ntransition of the dynamical system at _t_ \uf03d _t_ _c_ [Guglielmi, Klain, 2020]. As _t_ approaches _[t]_ [, ] _c_\n\n\nanomalous growth of seismicity fluctuations, critical deceleration (the so-called \u201cmode softening\u201d),\nand other interesting phenomena related to critical opalescence are expected [Guglielmi, 2015c].\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\nThis paper presented two models of the evolution of aftershocks \u2013 the logistic model which\ndescribes the variation in the frequency of aftershocks, and the Langevin model, which takes\naccount the fluctuations of aftershocks. A characteristic feature of the models is that they are\ndifferential. The models contain a small set of phenomenological parameters that quantitatively\ncharacterize each specific sequence of aftershocks. Models parameters can, in principle, be\nmeasured experimentally.\n\n\n**Acknowledgments** . I express my deep gratitude to B.I.
