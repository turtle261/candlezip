      "abstract": "Quotient sets have attracted the attention of mathematicians in the past\nthree decades. The set of quotients of primes is dense in the positive real\nnumbers and the set of all quotients of Gaussian primes is also dense in the\ncomplex plane. Sittinger has proved that the set of quotients of primes in an\nimaginary quadratic ring is dense in the complex plane and the set of quotients\nof primes in a real quadratic number ring is dense in R. An interesting open\nquestion is introduced by Sittinger: Is the set of quotients of Hurwitz primes\ndense in the quaternions? In this paper, we answer the question and prove that\nthe set of all quotients of Hurwitz primes is dense in the quaternions.",

      "abstract": "The dynamics of the kicked-rotor, that is a paradigm for a mixed system,\nwhere the motion in some parts of phase space is chaotic and in other parts is\nregular is studied statistically. The evolution (Frobenius-Perron) operator of\nphase space densities in the chaotic component is calculated in presence of\nnoise, and the limit of vanishing noise is taken is taken in the end of\ncalculation. The relaxation rates (related to the Ruelle resonances) to the\ninvariant equilibrium density are calculated analytically within an\napproximation that improves with increasing stochasticity. The results are\ntested numerically. The global picture of relaxation to the equilibrium density\nin the chaotic component when the system is bounded and of diffusive behavior\nwhen it is unbounded is presented.",

      "abstract": "The formalism of quantum field theory in operator form, based on the anti\nself-adjoint operators of the imaginary coordinate and momentum and the\nself-adjoint operators of the real coordinate, momentum, energy and time, is\nused in considerations of the spinor fields and related topics. The unitary\nrepresentation of the Lorentz boosts in the spin-orbital space is given. The\noperators that mirror-reflect the spin are introduced and then used in\ndiscussion of the spin parity. The conclusion that the spin is odd is used in\nthe analyze of the parity violation in the cobalt-60 beta decay and it is found\nthat the parity is not broken. The explanation why there are only right-handed\nantineutrinos and left-handed neutrinos is offered on the basis of appropriate\ntreatment of the influence of spin on momentum. The inversion of time is\ntreated within the framework of the operators of time and energy and this\nsymmetry is represented in a way that respects the Schr\\\"odinger equation and\nthis is done by the Wick rotations of involved operators and vectors of the\ncomplexified formalism.",

The approaches to defining\ncompetence of bachelor-electrician are determined. A system of competencies is\nsuggested. In order to determine the inclusion of each of the selected\ncompetencies in the formation of competence of Bachelor in Electromechanics,\nexperts' opinions were surveyed. The goals were to determine the structure and\ncontent of the bachelor's in Electromechanics competence in modeling. The\nresearch focus was to research the relationship of competence in modeling with\nother competencies of Bachelor of Electromechanics, its structure and the\ncontribution of components in the formation of competence. The object of the\nresearch was Bachelor's in Electromechanics learning process. The subject of\nthe research was the theoretical base of expertise of Bachelors in\nElectromechanics in modeling. The results of the research were the connection\nof competence in modeling with other competencies of Bachelor in\nElectromechanics, its structure and the contribution of components in the\nformation of competence. The structure and content of the electrician's\ncompetence in modeling were defined. The principal conclusions and\nrecommendations were: the system of competence in electromechanics in modeling\ninvolves three groups of competencies: the general scientific, common\nprofessional, and specific professional ones. The formation of competence of\nBachelor in Electromechanics in simulation cycle starts in mathematical and\nnatural-scientific training (the leading one is general scientific competence)\nand continues in the cycle of professional and practical training (the leading\nones are common professional and specific professional competencies).",

A calculational method in the\ncase of conventional superconductors (one order parameter) is developed and is\nextended for the case of two order parameters (s+d mixing). It is confirmed\nthat corrections tou the penetration depth, in the mean field analysis, are of\nthe order of ${H_0}^2$ where $H_0$ is the applied field. We analyze carefully\nthe possible solutions which lead to different scenarios in the physics of the\nsymmetry of the order parameter. The anisotropy in the penetration depth is\ncalculated and the temperature dependence of the magnetization is extracted. We\ndiscuss the relevant experimental results in the light of these calculations.",

      "abstract": "The spectrum of electromagnetic waves emitted by an oscillator trapped in an\nexternal potential well is studied. It is assumed that the natural frequency of\nthe oscillator is much greater than the frequency of oscillations in the\npotential well. We consider the quantum model of emission with regard to the\nrecoil effect. The highest intensity of the absorption and emission lines is\nobserved on the natural frequency of the oscillator when the recoil energy is\nequal to the energy of the quantum of low-frequency (LF) oscillations in the\npotential well.\n  A certain decrease in the amplitude of the emission and absorption lines is\nnoted caused by the oscillations of the potential well due to, for example, the\npresence of the phonon spectrum. The relaxation times of the oscillator LF\nmotion in the potential well, resulted from the phonon emission, are estimated.\nIt is concluded that these processes have no influence on the observed features\nof the emission and absorption of high-frequency photons. This model can be\napplied to description of the emission and absorption of gamma rays in the\ncrystal structures even in the presence of the phonon spectrum on condition\nthat the relaxation time of the LF movements in the potential well is greater\nthan the lifetime of the HF oscillator.",

The height of the\ntower is the number of words in the sequence. If there is no infinite tower (a\ntower of infinite height), then the height of all towers between the languages\nis bounded. We study upper and lower bounds on the height of maximal finite\ntowers with respect to the size of the NFA (the DFA) representation of the\nlanguages. We show that the upper bound is polynomial in the number of states\nand exponential in the size of the alphabet, and that it is asymptotically\ntight if the size of the alphabet is fixed. If the alphabet may grow, then,\nusing an alphabet of size approximately the number of states of the automata,\nthe lower bound on the height of towers is exponential with respect to that\nnumber. In this case, there is a gap between the lower and upper bound, and the\nasymptotically optimal bound remains an open problem. Since, in many cases, the\nconstructed towers are sequences of prefixes, we also study towers of prefixes.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we study decaying turbulence in fixed and rotating boxes in two\ndimen- sions using the particle method SPH. The boundaries are specified by\nboundary force particles, and the turbulence is initiated by a set of gaussian\nvortices. In the case of fixed boxes we recover the results of Clercx and his\ncolleagues obtained using both a high accuracy spectral method and experiments.\nOur results for fixed boxes are also in close agreement with those of Monaghan1\nand Robinson and Monaghan2 obtained using SPH. A feature of decaying turbulence\nin no-slip, square, fixed boundaries is that the angular momentum of the fluid\nvaries with time because of the reaction on the fluid of the viscous stresses\non the boundary. We find that when the box is allowed to rotate freely, so that\nthe total angular momentum of box and fluid is constant, the change in the\nangular momentum of the fluid is a factor ~ 500 smaller than is the case for\nthe fixed box, and the final vorticity distribution is different. We also\nsimulate the behaviour of the turbulence when the box is forced to rotate with\nsmall and large Rossby number, and the turbulence is initiated by gaussian\nvortices as before. If the rotation of the box is maintained after the\nturbulence is initiated we find that in the rotating frame the decay of kinetic\nenergy, enstrophy and the vortex structure is insensitive to the angular\nvelocity of the box. On the other hand, If the box is allowed to rotate freely\nafter the turbulence is initiated, the evolved vortex structure is completely\ndifferent.",
