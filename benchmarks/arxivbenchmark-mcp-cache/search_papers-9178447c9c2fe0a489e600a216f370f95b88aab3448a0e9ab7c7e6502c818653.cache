      "abstract": "The paper studies the class of all metric spaces considered up to zero\nGromov-Hausdorff distance between them. In this class, we examine clouds -\nclasses of spaces situated at finite Gromov-Hausdorff distances from a\nreference space. We prove that all clouds are proper classes. The\nGromov-Hausdorff distance is defined for clouds similarly with the case of that\nfor metric spaces. A multiplicative group of transformations of clouds is\ndefined which is called stabilizer. We show that under certain restrictions the\ndistance between the cloud of bounded metric spaces and a cloud with a\nnontrivial stabilizer is finite. In particular, the distance between the cloud\nof bounded metric spaces and the cloud containing the real line is calculated.",

      "abstract": "Enterprises are driving towards less cost, more availability, agility,\nmanaged risk - all of which is accelerated towards Cloud Computing. Cloud is\nnot a particular product, but a way of delivering IT services that are\nconsumable on demand, elastic to scale up and down as needed, and follow a\npay-for-usage model. Out of the three common types of cloud computing service\nmodels, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a service model that provides\nservers, computing power, network bandwidth and Storage capacity, as a service\nto their subscribers. Cloud can relate to many things but without the\nfundamental storage pieces, which is provided as a service namely Cloud\nStorage, none of the other applications is possible. This paper introduces\nCloud Storage, which covers the key technologies in cloud computing and Cloud\nStorage, management insights about cloud computing, different types of cloud\nservices, driving forces of cloud computing and cloud storage, advantages and\nchallenges of cloud storage and concludes by pinpointing few challenges to be\naddressed by the cloud storage providers.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, cloud computing has been widely used. Cloud computing refers\nto the centralized computing resources, users through the access to the\ncentralized resources to complete the calculation, the cloud computing center\nwill return the results of the program processing to the user. Cloud computing\nis not only for individual users, but also for enterprise users. By purchasing\na cloud server, users do not have to buy a large number of computers, saving\ncomputing costs. According to a report by China Economic News Network, the\nscale of cloud computing in China has reached 209.1 billion yuan. At present,\nthe more mature cloud service providers in China are Ali Cloud, Baidu Cloud,\nHuawei Cloud and so on. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative approach\nto solve complex problems in cloud computing resource scheduling and management\nusing machine learning optimization techniques. Through in-depth study of\nchallenges such as low resource utilization and unbalanced load in the cloud\nenvironment, this study proposes a comprehensive solution, including\noptimization methods such as deep learning and genetic algorithm, to improve\nsystem performance and efficiency, and thus bring new breakthroughs and\nprogress in the field of cloud computing resource management.Rational\nallocation of resources plays a crucial role in cloud computing. In the\nresource allocation of cloud computing, the cloud computing center has limited\ncloud resources, and users arrive in sequence. Each user requests the cloud\ncomputing center to use a certain number of cloud resources at a specific time.",

      "abstract": "The interaction of a hot, high-velocity wind with a cold, dense molecular\ncloud has often been assumed to resemble the evolution of a cloud embedded in a\npost-shock flow. However, no direct comparative study of these two processes\ncurrently exists in the literature. We present 2D adiabatic hydrodynamical\nsimulations of the interaction of a Mach 10 shock with a cloud of density\ncontrast $\\chi = 10$ and compare our results with those of a commensurate\nwind-cloud simulation. We then investigate the effect of varying the wind\nvelocity, effectively altering the wind Mach number $M_{wind}$, on the cloud's\nevolution. We find that there are significant differences between the two\nprocesses: 1) the transmitted shock is much flatter in the shock-cloud\ninteraction; 2) a low-pressure region in the wind-cloud case deflects the flow\naround the edge of the cloud in a different manner to the shock-cloud case; 3)\nthere is far more axial compression of the cloud in the case of the shock. As\n$M_{wind}$ increases, the normalised rate of mixing is reduced. Clouds in winds\nwith higher $M_{wind}$ also do not experience a transmitted shock through the\ncloud's rear and are more compressed axially. In contrast with shock-cloud\nsimulations, the cloud mixing time normalised by the cloud-crushing time-scale\n$t_{cc}$ increases for increasing $M_{wind}$ until it plateaus (at $t_{mix}\n\\simeq 25 \\, t_{cc}$) at high $M_{wind}$, thus demonstrating the expected Mach\nscaling. In addition, clouds in high Mach number winds are able to survive for\nlong durations and are capable of being moved considerable distances.",

      "abstract": "A warm cloud modification experiment was carried out in an area of 4800 Sq.Km\nin the Pune region,India, during the 11-summer monsoon (June-September) seasons\n(1973-74, 1976, 1979-86). A double-area cross-over design with area\nrandomization was adopted and an instrumented aircraft was used for seeding and\ncloud physical measurements. Finely pulverised salt (sodium chloride) particles\nwere released into the monsoon clouds (cumulus and stratocumulus) during\naircraft penetrations into the clouds at a height of 200-300 m above the\ncloud-base. The warm cloud responses to salt seeding are found to be critically\ndependent on the cloud physical characteristics e.g., vertical thickness and\nliquid water content. Clouds with vertical thickness greater than 1 km, LWC\ngreater than 0.5 gm/cubic m when seeded with salt particles (modal diameter 10\nmicro m, concentration 1 per litre of cloud air) produced increase in rainfall\nof 24 per cent significant at 4 per cent level. Shallow clouds (vertical\nthickness less than 1 km, LWC less than 0.5 gm/cubic m) when seeded showed\ntendency for dissipation. The cloud physical observations made in not-seeded\n(control) and seeded (target) clouds have provided some useful evidence to test\nthe applicability of the warm cloud modification hypothesis. The results of the\ncloud model computations suggested that moderate convergence at the cloud-base\nis essential for the cloud growth and development of precipitation in the real\nworld. Hygroscopic particle seeding of warm clouds under favourable dynamical\nconditions (convergence at the cloud-base level) may result in the acceleration\nof the collision-coalescence process resulting in the enhancement of rainfall.",

      "abstract": "As more IoT applications gradually move towards the cloud-edge collaborative\nmode, the containerized scheduling of workflows extends from the cloud to the\nedge. However, given the high delay of the communication network, loose\ncoupling of structure, and resource heterogeneity between cloud and edge,\nworkflow containerization scheduling in the cloud-edge scenarios faces the\ndifficulty of resource coordination and application collaboration management.\nTo address these two issues, we propose a KubeEdge-Cloud-Edge-Scheduling scheme\nnamed KCES, a workflow containerization scheduling scheme for the KubeEdge\ncloud-edge framework. The KCES includes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine\nfor KubeEdge and workflow scheduling strategies for task horizontal roaming and\nvertical offloading. Considering the scheduling optimization of cloud-edge\nworkflows, this paper proposes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling model and\ncloud-edge node model and designs a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine to\nmaximize cloud-edge resource utilization under the constraint of workflow task\ndelay. A cloud-edge resource hybrid management technology is used to design the\ncloud-edge resource evaluation and resource allocation algorithms to achieve\ncloud-edge resource collaboration. Based on the ideas of distributed functional\nroles and the hierarchical division of computing power, the horizontal roaming\namong the edges and vertical offloading strategies between the cloud and edges\nfor workflow tasks are designed to realize the cloud-edge application\ncollaboration. Through a customized IoT application workflow instance,\nexperimental results show that KCES is superior to the baseline in total\nworkflow duration, average workflow duration, and resource usage and has the\ncapabilities of horizontal roaming and vertical offloading for workflow tasks.",

We derive projected morphologies of all clouds and\nestimate the volume filling factor of warm partially ionized material in the\nLISM to be between ~5.5% and 19%. Relative velocities of potentially\ninteracting clouds are often supersonic, consistent with heating, turbulent,\nand metal-depletion properties. Cloud-cloud collisions may be responsible for\nthe filamentary morphologies found in ~1/3 of LISM clouds, the distribution of\nclouds along the boundaries of the two nearest clouds (LIC and G), the detailed\nshape and heating of the Mic Cloud, the location of nearby radio scintillation\nscreens, and the location of a LISM cold cloud. Contrary to previous claims,\nthe Sun appears to be located in the transition zone between the LIC and G\nClouds.",

      "abstract": "We explore the survival of cool clouds in multi-phase circum-galactic media.\nWe revisit the \"cloud crushing problem\" in a large survey of simulations\nincluding radiative cooling, self-shielding, self-gravity, magnetic fields, and\nanisotropic Braginskii conduction and viscosity (with saturation). We explore a\nwide range of parameters including cloud size, velocity, ambient temperature\nand density, as well as a variety of magnetic field configurations and cloud\nturbulence. We find that realistic magnetic fields and turbulence have weaker\neffects on cloud survival; the most important physics is radiative cooling and\nconduction. Self-gravity and self-shielding are important for clouds which are\ninitially Jeans-unstable, but largely irrelevant otherwise.\nNon-self-gravitating, realistically magnetized clouds separate into four\nregimes: (1) At low column densities, clouds evaporate rapidly via conduction.\n(2) A \"failed pressure confinement\" regime, where the ambient hot gas cools too\nrapidly to provide pressure confinement for the cloud. (3) An \"infinitely\nlong-lived\" regime, in which the cloud lifetime becomes longer than the cooling\ntime of gas swept up in the leading bow shock, so the cloud begins to accrete\nand grow. (4) A \"classical cloud destruction\" regime, where clouds are\neventually destroyed by instabilities. In the final regime, the cloud lifetime\ncan exceed the naive cloud-crushing time owing to conduction-induced\ncompression. However, small and/or slow-moving clouds can also evaporate more\nrapidly than the cloud-crushing time. We develop simple analytic models that\nexplain the simulated cloud destruction times in this regime.",
