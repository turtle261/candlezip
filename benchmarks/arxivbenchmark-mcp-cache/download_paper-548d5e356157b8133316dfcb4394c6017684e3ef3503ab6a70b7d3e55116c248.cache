OSIPCHUK\n\n\nAbstract. The present work concerns generalized convex sets in the\nreal multi-dimensional Euclidean space, known as weakly 1-convex and\nweakly 1-semiconvex sets. An open set is called weakly 1-convex (weakly\n1-semiconvex ) if, through every boundary point of the set, there passes\na straight line (a closed ray) not intersecting the set. A closed set is\ncalled weakly 1-convex (weakly 1-semiconvex ) if it is approximated from\nthe outside by a family of open weakly 1-convex (weakly 1-semiconvex)\nsets. A point of the complement of a set to the whole space is a 1nonconvexity (1-nonsemiconvexity) point of the set if every straight line\npassing through the point (every ray emanating from the point) intersects the set. It is proved that if the collection of all 1-nonconvexity\n(1-nonsemiconvexity) points corresponding to an open weakly 1-convex\n(weakly 1-semiconvex) set is non-empty, then it is open. It is also\nproved that the non-empty interior of a closed weakly 1-convex (weakly\n1-semiconvex) set in the space is weakly 1-convex (weakly 1-semiconvex).\n\n\nKeywords: convex set, weakly 1-convex set, 1-nonconvexity-point set,\nweakly 1-semiconvex set, 1-nonsemiconvexity-point set, real Euclidean\n\nspace\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe weakly m-convex and weakly m-semiconvex sets, m = 1, 2, . . ., n \u2212 1, in the\nreal space R [n], n \u2a7e 2, with the Euclidean norm, can be seen as a generalization of\nconvex sets. The notions were coined by Yurii Zelinskii [11], [12]. First, recall the\nfollowing definitions.\nAny m-dimensional affine subspace of R [n], m = 0, 1, 2, . . ., n \u2212 1, n \u2a7e 1, is called\nan m-dimensional plane. A 1-dimensional plane is also known as a straight\nline.\n\nOne of two parts of an m-dimensional plane, m = 1, 2, . . ., n\u2212 1, of the space R [n],\nn \u2a7e 2, into which it is divided by any of its (m \u2212 1)-dimensional planes (herewith,\nthe points of the (m \u2212 1)-dimensional plane are included) is said to be an mdimensional half-plane. A 1-dimensional half-plane is also known as a ray .\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Zelinskii [11], [12]). An open subset E \u2282 R [n], n \u2a7e 2, is called\nweakly m-convex (weakly m-semiconvex), m = 1, 2, . . ., n \u2212 1, if for any point\nx \u2208 \u2202E, there exists an m-dimensional plane L (m-dimensional half-plane L) such\nthat x \u2208 L and L \u2229 E = \u2205.\n\n\nThey say that a set A is approximated from the outside by a family of open\nsets A k, k = 1, 2, . . ., if A k+1 is contained in A k, and A = \u2229 k A k ([1]).\n\n\n2020 Mathematics Subject Classification.

OSIPCHUK\n\n\nIt can be proved that any set approximated from the outside by a family of open\nsets is closed.\n\n\nDefinition 2 (Zelinskii [11], [12]). A closed subset E \u2282 R [n], n \u2a7e 2, is called weakly\nm-convex (weakly m-semiconvex), m = 1, 2, . . ., n\u2212 1, if it can be approximated\nfrom the outside by a family of open weakly m-convex (weakly m-semiconvex) sets.\n\n\nThe class of weakly m-convex sets in R [n] is denoted by WC [n] m [and the class of]\nweakly m-semiconvex sets in R [n] is denoted by WS [n] m [.]\nThe properties of the class of generalized convex sets on Grassmannian manifolds which are closely related to the properties of the conjugate sets (see [12,\nDefinition 2]) are investigated in [12]. This class includes WC [n] m [. The geometric]\nand topological properties of weakly m-convex sets are also investigated in [2], [3].\nThe theory of weakly m-semiconvex sets is newish and it is based on the research\nof some subclass as well as further investigation of weakly m-convex sets also focuses\non the similar subclass. In order to determine these subclasses, we need to set the\nfollowing definition.\n\n\nDefinition 3. A point x \u2208 R [n] \\ E is called an m-nonconvexity (mnonsemiconvexity ) point of a subset E \u2282 R [n] if every m-dimensional plane\n(m-dimensional half-plane) passing through x intersects E. The set of all mnonconvexity (m-nonsemiconvexity) points of a subset E \u2282 R [n] is called the mnonconvexity-point (m-nonsemiconvexity-point) set corresponding to E and\nis denoted by E m [\u25b3] [(][E] m [\u2666] [). Moreover,][ E] [\u25b3] [:=][ E] 1 [\u25b3] [,][ E] [\u2666] [:=][ E] 1 [\u2666] [.]\n\n\nThe class of weakly m-convex sets in R [n] with non-empty m-nonconvexity-point\nset is denoted by WC [n] m [\\][ C] [n] m [and the class of weakly][ m][-semiconvex sets with]\nnon-empty m-nonsemiconvexity-point set in R [n] is denoted by WS [n] m [\\][ S] [n] m [.]\nThe disconnectedness of any open weakly 1-semiconvex set with non-empty 1nonsemiconvexity-point set in the plane was established by Zelinskii [11, Theorem 7]. Moreover, the following result is true.\n\n\nLemma 1 (Dakhil [2], Osipchuk [8]).

Moreover, if we want to construct an open set\nbelonging to the class WS [2] 1 [\\][ S] [2] 1 [with countably infinite number of components,]\nthen, instead of a triangle inside a convex set, we should throw away a closed convex\ngeneralized polygon (the convex hull of a bounded countably infinite set of points\n\n\nON WEAKLY 1-CONVEX AND WEAKLY 1-SEMICONVEX SETS 3\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nin the plane with boundary containing countably infinite number of vertices).

OSIPCHUK\n\n\nBut unlike weakly 1-semiconvex sets with smooth boundary, any open weakly\n(n \u2212 1)-convex set in R [n] with smooth boundary does not have (n \u2212 1)-nonconvexity\npoints [2, Proposition 2.3.7].\nAn example of sets belonging to the class WC [2] 1 [\\][ C] [2] 1 [can be constructed by]\ncutting an open convex set without closed convex polygon or generalized polygon\nin Figures 1 a) and 2 b) along the straight lines containing the sides and the\naccumulation points of vertices of the polygons instead of rays.

There exist domains and closed connected sets in the\nspace R [n], n \u2a7e 3, belonging to the class WC [n] m [\\][ C] [n] m [(][WS] [n] m [\\][ S] [n] m [),][ 1][ \u2a7d] [m < n][ \u2212] [1][.]\n\n\nOf special interest are the properties of m-nonconvexity-point sets corresponding to weakly m-convex sets and m-nonsemiconvexity-point sets corresponding to\nweakly m-semiconvex sets.

But they cannot be arbitrarily placed in\nthe plane. Their arrangement is constrained by property (d).\nThe methods developed to prove item (a) in Lemmas 6 and 7 allow us to obtain\nthe following result for the closed weakly 1-convex (weakly 1-semiconvex) sets in\nthe plane.\n\n\nLemma 8 (Osipchuk [9, 10]). Let E \u2282 R [2] be a closed subset such that Int E \u0338= \u2205. If\nE is weakly 1-convex (weakly 1-semiconvex), then Int E is weakly 1-convex (weakly\n1-semiconvex).\n\n\nIn this study, we focus on establishing the general topological properties of the\n1-nonconvexity-point set corresponding to an open weakly 1-convex set and the\n1-nonsemiconvexity-point set corresponding to an open weakly 1-semiconvex set in\nR [n], n \u2a7e 2.\n\n\nON WEAKLY 1-CONVEX AND WEAKLY 1-SEMICONVEX SETS 5\n\n\nFirst, we prove that The 1-nonsemiconvexity-point set E [\u2666] corresponding to an\nopen set E \u2208 WS [n] 1 [\\][ S] [n] 1 [,][ n][ \u2a7e] [2][, is open][. Therefore, we generalize Lemma 7 (a) on]\nthe real Euclidean space of any dimension n \u2a7e 2. The proof algorithm is similar to\nthe proof of Lemma 7 (a). Its essence is to find, for every fixed point y \u2208 E [\u2666] and\neach ray emanating from y, points x \u03b1 (y), \u03b1 \u2208 S [n][\u2212][1], on these rays, and the number\nd(y) > 0 such that the points x \u03b1 (y) are contained in E together with open balls of\nthe same radii d(y). This allows us to assert that any ray emanating from an open\nball with center at y and radius \u03b5 \u2264 d(y) intersects the union of the balls contained\nin E. Thus, we show that y is an inner point of E [\u2666] .\nTo find x \u03b1 (y) \u2208 E \u2282 R [2], \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], it was used the connectedness of the\ncomponents of E. Namely, there were constructed the finite number of curves\ncontained in E and such that every ray emanating from y intersects the union of\nthe curves. Moreover, it was shown that points x \u03b1 (y) are actually placed on those\ncurves and d(y) is the minimum value of the restrictions of the distance functions\ndefined on the components of E to the respective curves. This trick fails for the\nset E in the spaces of higher dimensions, obviously. But we are lucky to find not\none-dimensional compacts that meet our requirements.\nUsing the same algorithm, we also prove that The 1-nonconvexity-point set G [\u25b3]\n\ncorresponding to an open set G \u2208 WC [n] 1 [\\][ C] 1 [n] [,][ n][ \u2a7e] [2][, is open][. But in this case, we]\nshow that, for every fixed point y \u2208 G [\u25b3] and each straight line passing through y,\nthere exist points x \u03b1 (y), \u03b1 \u2208 S [n][\u2212][1], on these lines, and the number d(y) > 0 such\nthat the points x \u03b1 (y) are contained in G together with open balls of the same radii\nd(y).\nThe consequents of these two statements are that E [\u2666] is weakly 1-semiconvex for\nE \u2208 WS [n] 1 [\\][ S] [n] 1 [and][ G] [\u25b3] [is weakly 1-convex for][ G][ \u2208] [WC] [n] 1 [\\][ C] [n] 1 [,][ n][ \u2a7e] [2.]\nThe methods developed to prove the first two results allow us to generalize\nLemma 8 on closed weakly 1-semiconvex and closed weakly 1-convex sets in R [n],\nn \u2a7e 2.\nProperty (d) of Lemma 7 easily extends to all spaces with dimensions n \u2a7e 2,\nand is also inherent to weakly 1-convex sets of those spaces.\nOur final result refutes the validity of Lemma 6 (b) and Lemma 7 (b) for the\nspaces R [n], n \u2a7e 3, as we construct examples of simultaneously weakly 1-convex and\nweakly 1-semiconvex open sets in R [n], n \u2a7e 3, which non-empty 1-nonconvexitypoint sets are non-convex, bounded (or unbounded) and coincide with their 1nonsemiconvexity-point sets.\nWe give here briefly some directions for further research. Probably the most\nnatural next question to study would be to investigate the general topological properties of E m [\u2666] [,][ E][ \u2208] [WS] m [n] [\\][ S] [n] m [, and][ G] [\u25b3] m [,][ G][ \u2208] [WC] m [n] [\\][ C] [n] m [, for][ n][ \u2a7e] [2,][ m][ \u2a7e] [1.

Since U (x \u03b1, \u03b5) \u2286 U (x \u03b1, d) \u2282 E for\nthe point x \u03b1 correspondent to \u03b7 \u03b1 (y), it follows that \u03b7 \u03b1 (z) \u2229 U (x \u03b1, \u03b5) \u0338= \u2205 and,\ntherefore, \u03b7 \u03b1 (z) \u2229 E \u0338= \u2205 for any \u03b1 \u2208 S [n][\u2212][1] ; see Figure 4 a). Thus, z is a 1nonsemiconvexity point of E. Since z is arbitrary, it implies that all points of\nU (y, \u03b5) are 1-nonsemiconvexity points of E. Hence, y is an inner point of E [\u2666] . \n\nFigure 4\n\n\n8 TETIANA M. OSIPCHUK\n\n\nCorollary 1.

Since E [\u2666] is open, then for any point y \u2208 \u2202E [\u2666], there exists a ray \u03b7 \u03b1 \u2032 (y),\n\u03b1 [\u2032] \u2208 S [n][\u2212][1], not intersecting E. Then \u03b7 \u03b1 \u2032 (y) \u2229 E [\u2666] = \u2205 by Definition 3. Thus, E [\u2666]\n\nis weakly 1-semiconvex. \n\nTheorem 2. Suppose that an open subset E \u2282 R [n] belongs to the class WC [n] 1 [\\][ C] [n] 1 [.]\nThen E [\u25b3] is open.\n\n\nProof. The scheme of proving this theorem is exactly the same as for Theorem 1.\nWe fix an arbitrary point of E [\u25b3] and show that there exists a neighborhood of this\npoint which belongs to E [\u25b3] . To do so, we use Lemma 9 with respect to the points\ny \u2208 E [\u25b3] and the straight lines \u03b3 \u03b1 (y), \u03b1 \u2208 S [n][\u2212][1], and we also replace the rays with\nthe straight lines everywhere in the proof of Theorem 1. \n\nCorollary 2. Suppose that an open subset E \u2282 R [n] belongs to the class WC [n] 1 [\\] [C] [n] 1 [.]\nThen E [\u25b3] is weakly 1-convex.\n\n\nTheorem 3. Let E \u2282 R [n] be a closed subset such that Int E \u0338= \u2205. If E is weakly\n1-semiconvex, then Int E is weakly 1-semiconvex.\n\n\nProof. Suppose that Int E is not weakly 1-semiconvex. Then there exists a 1nonsemiconvexity point y \u2208 \u2202E of the set Int E.\nBy Lemma 9, for the point y, there exist points x \u03b1 \u2208 \u03b7 \u03b1 (y) \u2229 Int E, \u03b1 \u2208 S [n][\u2212][1],\nand a constant d > 0 such that U (x \u03b1, d) \u2282 Int E.\nConsider the neighborhood U (y, d) of the point y; see Figure 4 b). Since E is\nweakly 1-semiconvex, there exists a family of open weakly 1-semiconvex sets G k,\nk = 1, 2, . . ., approximating E from the outside. Then there exists an index k 0\nsuch that \u2202G k \u2229 U (y, d) \u0338= \u2205 for all k \u2a7e k 0 . For each k \u2a7e k 0, choose a point\nz k \u2208 \u2202G k \u2229 U (y, d) and draw an arbitrary ray \u03b7 \u03b1 (z k ), \u03b1 \u2208 S [n][\u2212][1], with initial point\nat z k . Consider the ray \u03b7 \u03b1 (y) parallel to \u03b7 \u03b1 (z k ). Since U (x \u03b1, d) \u2282 Int E \u2282 E for\nthe point x \u03b1 correspondent to \u03b7 \u03b1 (y), it follows that \u03b7 \u03b1 (z k ) \u2229 U (x \u03b1, d) \u0338= \u2205 and,\ntherefore, \u03b7 \u03b1 (z k ) \u2229 E \u0338= \u2205. Since G k \u2283 E, k = 1, 2, . . ., then \u03b7 \u03b1 (z k ) \u2229 G k \u0338= \u2205,\nk \u2a7e k 0 .\nSince the ray \u03b7 \u03b1 (z k ) is arbitrary, the point z k \u2208 \u2202G k is a 1-nonsemiconvexity\npoint of G k for all k \u2a7e k 0, which gives a contradiction. \n\nTheorem 4. Let E \u2282 R [n] be a closed subset such that Int E \u0338= \u2205. If E is weakly\n1-convex, then Int E is weakly 1-convex.\n\n\nProof. The proof of this theorem is the same as the proof of Theorem 3. We only\nconsider weakly 1-convex sets instead of weakly 1-semiconvex and replace the rays\nwith the straight lines everywhere in the proof of Theorem 3. \n\nProposition 1.
