      "abstract": "Cell experiments with large, short electric field pulses of opposite polarity\nreveal a remarkable phenomenon: Bipolar cancellation (BPC). Typical defining\nexperiments involve quantitative observation of tracer molecule influx at times\nof order 100 s post pulsing. Gowrishankar et al. BBRC 2018 503:1194-1199 shows\nthat long-lived pores and altered partitioning or hindrance due to inserted\noccluding molecules can account for BPC. In stark contrast, the Assisted\nDischarge (AD) hypothesis, Pakhomov et al. CellMol- LifeSci 2014\n71(22):4431-4441; Fig. 6, only involves early times of a microsecond down to\nnanoseconds. Further, well established terminology for cell membrane discharge\nrelates to membrane potential decays shortly after pulsing. Discharge is silent\non molecular or ionic transport, and does not address the fact that tracer\nmolecule uptake vs time is measure at about 100s after pulsing ceases. Our\ncritique of AD notes that there can be an association of AD with BPC, but\nassociations are only necessary, not sufficient. A BPC mechanism hypothesis\nmust be shown to be causal, able to describe time-dependent molecular influx.\nThe two hypotheses involve very different time-scales (less than a microsecond\nvs 100 s) and very different quantities (volts/s vs molecules/s). Unlike\npore-based hypotheses the AD hypothesis lacks explicit molecular transport\nmechanisms, and does not address the greatly delayed measured molecular uptake.\nWe conclude that AD is an implausible candidate for explaining BPC.",

      "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications are\nneeded to meet the extreme requirements of enhanced driving applications.\nMillimeter-Wave (24.25-52.6 GHz) or sub-THz (>100 GHz) V2X communications are a\nviable solution, provided that the highly collimated beams are kept aligned\nduring vehicles' maneuverings. In this work, we propose a sensor-assisted\ndynamic Beamwidth and Power Control (BPC) system to counteract the detrimental\neffect of vehicle dynamics, exploiting data collected by on-board inertial and\npositioning sensors, mutually exchanged among vehicles over a parallel low-rate\nlink, e.g., 5G New Radio (NR) Frequency Range 1 (FR1). The proposed BPC\nsolution works on top of a sensor-aided Beam Alignment and Tracking (BAT)\nsystem, overcoming the limitations of fixed-beamwidth systems and optimizing\nthe performance in challenging Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) scenarios, even if\nextensions to Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) use-cases are feasible. We\nvalidate the sensor-assisted dynamic BPC on real trajectories and sensors' data\ncollected by a dedicated experimental campaign. The goal is to show the\nadvantages of the proposed BPC strategy in a high data-rate Line-Of-Sight (LOS)\nV2V context, and to outline the requirements in terms of sensors' sampling time\nand accuracy, along with the end-to-end latency on the control channel.",

      "abstract": "We give a comprehensive study of bin packing with conflicts (BPC). The input\nis a set $I$ of items, sizes $s:I \\rightarrow [0,1]$, and a conflict graph $G =\n(I,E)$. The goal is to find a partition of $I$ into a minimum number of\nindependent sets, each of total size at most $1$. Being a generalization of the\nnotoriously hard graph coloring problem, BPC has been studied mostly on\npolynomially colorable conflict graphs. An intriguing open question is whether\nBPC on such graphs admits the same best known approximation guarantees as\nclassic bin packing.\n  We answer this question negatively, by showing that (in contrast to bin\npacking) there is no asymptotic polynomial-time approximation scheme (APTAS)\nfor BPC already on seemingly easy graph classes, such as bipartite and split\ngraphs. We complement this result with improved approximation guarantees for\nBPC on several prominent graph classes. Most notably, we derive an asymptotic\n$1.391$-approximation for bipartite graphs, a $2.445$-approximation for perfect\ngraphs, and a $\\left(1+\\frac{2}{e}\\right)$-approximation for split graphs. To\nthis end, we introduce a generic framework relying on a novel interpretation of\nBPC allowing us to solve the problem via maximization techniques.\n  Our framework may find use in tackling BPC on other graph classes arising in\napplications.",

      "abstract": "Extraordinarily large but short electric field pulses are reported by many\nexperiments to cause bipolar cancellation (BPC). This unusual cell response\noccurs if a first pulse is followed by a second pulse with opposite polarity.\nPossibly universal, BPC presently lacks a mechanistic explanation. Multiple\nversions of the \"standard model\" of cell electroporation (EP) fail to account\nfor BPC. Here we show, for the first time, how an extension of the standard\nmodel can account for a key experimental observation that essentially defines\nBPC: the amount of a tracer that enters a cell, and how tracer influx can be\ndecreased by the second part of a bipolar pulse. The extended model can also\naccount for the recovery of BPC wherein the extent of BPC is diminished if the\nspacing between the first and second pulses is increased. Our approach is\nreverse engineering, meaning that we identify and introduce an additional\nbiophysical mechanism that allows pore transport to change. We hypothesize that\noccluding molecules from outside the membrane enter or relocate within a pore.\nSignificantly, the additional mechanism is fundamental and general, involving a\ncombination of partitioning and hindrance. Molecules near the membrane can\nenter pores to block transport of tracer molecules while still passing small\nions (+/- 1) that govern electrical behavior. Accounting for such behavior\nrequires an extension of the standard model.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have confirmed that by augmenting acoustic features with the\nplace/manner of articulatory features, the speech enhancement (SE) process can\nbe guided to consider the broad phonetic properties of the input speech when\nperforming enhancement to attain performance improvements. In this paper, we\nexplore the contextual information of articulatory attributes as additional\ninformation to further benefit SE. More specifically, we propose to improve the\nSE performance by leveraging losses from an end-to-end automatic speech\nrecognition (E2E-ASR) model that predicts the sequence of broad phonetic\nclasses (BPCs). We also developed multi-objective training with ASR and\nperceptual losses to train the SE system based on a BPC-based E2E-ASR.\nExperimental results from speech denoising, speech dereverberation, and\nimpaired speech enhancement tasks confirmed that contextual BPC information\nimproves SE performance. Moreover, the SE model trained with the BPC-based\nE2E-ASR outperforms that with the phoneme-based E2E-ASR. The results suggest\nthat objectives with misclassification of phonemes by the ASR system may lead\nto imperfect feedback, and BPC could be a potentially better choice. Finally,\nit is noted that combining the most-confusable phonetic targets into the same\nBPC when calculating the additional objective can effectively improve the SE\nperformance.",

      "abstract": "Radios are essential for the operations of modern police departments, and\nthey function as both a collaborative communication technology and a\nsociotechnical system. However, little prior research has examined their usage\nor their connections to individual privacy and the role of race in policing,\ntwo growing topics of concern in the US. As a case study, we examine the\nChicago Police Department's (CPD's) use of broadcast police communications\n(BPC) to coordinate the activity of law enforcement officers (LEOs) in the\ncity. From a recently assembled archive of 80,775 hours of BPC associated with\nCPD operations, we analyze text transcripts of radio transmissions broadcast\n9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on August 10th, 2018 in one majority Black, one majority\nwhite, and one majority Hispanic area of the city (24 hours of audio) to\nexplore three research questions: (1) Do BPC reflect reported racial\ndisparities in policing? (2) How and when is gender, race/ethnicity, and age\nmentioned in BPC? (3) To what extent do BPC include sensitive information, and\nwho is put at most risk by this practice? (4) To what extent can large language\nmodels (LLMs) heighten this risk? We explore the vocabulary and speech acts\nused by police in BPC, comparing mentions of personal characteristics to local\ndemographics, the personal information shared over BPC, and the privacy\nconcerns that it poses. Analysis indicates (a) policing professionals in the\ncity of Chicago exhibit disproportionate attention to Black members of the\npublic regardless of context, (b) sociodemographic characteristics like gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and age are primarily mentioned in BPC about event information,\nand (c) disproportionate attention introduces disproportionate privacy risks\nfor Black members of the public.",

The study\nof pattern-avoiding inversion sequences began in two independent articles by\nMansour-Shattuck and Corteel-Martinez-Savage-Weselcouch in 2015 and 2016. These\ntwo initial articles solved the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding a\nsingle pattern for every pattern of length 3 except the patterns 010 and 100.\nThe case 100 was recently solved by Mansour and Yildirim. We solve the final\ncase by making use of a decomposition of inversion sequences avoiding the\npattern 010. Our decomposition needs to take into account the maximal value,\nand the number of distinct values occurring in the inversion sequence. We then\nexpand our method to solve the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding the\npairs of patterns $\\{010, 000\\}, \\{010, 110\\}, \\{010, 120\\}$, and the\nWilf-equivalent pairs $\\{010, 201\\} \\sim \\{010, 210\\}$.
