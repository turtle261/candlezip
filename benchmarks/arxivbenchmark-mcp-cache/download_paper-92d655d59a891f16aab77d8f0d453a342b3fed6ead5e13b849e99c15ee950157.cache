A diagram of algebras is a functor from a small category to some\ncategory of algebras. For an appropriate category of algebras we get a diagram of groups, a diagram\nof Lie algebras, a diagram of commutative rings, etc.\nWe define the cohomology of diagrams of algebras using comonads. The cohomology of diagrams\nof algebras classifies extensions in the category of functors. Our main result is that there is a\nspectral sequence connecting the cohomology of the diagram of algebras to the cohomology of the\nmembers of the diagram.\n\u03a8-rings can be thought of as functors from the category with one object associated to the\nmultiplicative monoid of the natural numbers to the category of commutative rings. So we can\napply the theory we developed for the diagrams of algebras to the case of \u03a8-rings. Our main\nresult tells us that there is a spectral sequence connecting the cohomology of the \u03a8-ring to the\nAndr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology of the underlying commutative ring.\nThe main example of a \u03bb-ring or a \u03a8-ring is the K-theory of a topological space. We look\nat the example of the K-theory of spheres and use its cohomology to give a proof of the classical\nresult of Adams. We show that there are natural transformations connecting the cohomology of the\nK-theory of spheres to the homotopy groups of spheres. There is a very close connection between\nthe cohomology of the K-theory of the 4n-dimensional spheres and the homotopy groups of the\n(4n \u2212 1)-dimensional spheres.\n\n\n##### Acknowledgments\n\nFirstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Teimuraz Pirashvili, for all of his useful advice\nand support throughout this project and for introducing me to the subject of \u03bb-rings.

later\nused in group theory by Atiyah and Tall. A \u03bb-ring R is a commutative ring with identity, together\nwith operations \u03bb [i] : R \u2192 R, for i \u2265 0. We require that \u03bb [0] (r) = 1 and \u03bb [1] (r) = r for all r \u2208 R.\nThere are more complicated axioms describing \u03bb [i] (r 1 +r 2 ), \u03bb [i] (r 1 r 2 ) and \u03bb [i] (\u03bb [j] (r)). The \u03bb-operations\nbehave like exterior powers. The more complicated axioms are difficult to work with, and given a\n\u03bb-ring R, it is difficult to prove that it is actually a \u03bb-ring.\nIn 1962 Adams introduced the operations \u03a8 [i] to study vector fields of spheres. These operations\ngive us another type of ring, the \u03a8-rings, which are related to the \u03bb-rings by the following formula.\n\n\n\u03a8 [i] (r) \u2212 \u03bb [1] (r)\u03a8 [i][\u2212][1] (r) + ... + (\u22121) [i][\u2212][1] \u03bb [i][\u2212][1] (r)\u03a8 [1] (r) + (\u22121) [i] i\u03bb [i] (r) = 0.\n\n\nA \u03a8-ring is a commutative ring R, together with ring homomorphisms \u03a8 [i] : R \u2192 R, for i \u2265 1.\nWe only require that \u03a8 [1] (r) = r and \u03a8 [i] (\u03a8 [j] (r)) = \u03a8 [ij] (r) for all r \u2208 R. The \u03a8-rings are much\neasier to work with, and in several places we will need to pass to \u03a8-rings to be able to carry out\ncomputations for \u03bb-rings.\nHomological algebra is a relatively young discipline, which arose from algebraic topology in\nthe early 20 [th] century. In 1956, Cartan and Eilenberg published their book entitled \u201cHomological\nAlgebra\u201d [5], which was the first book on homological algebra and still remains a standard book of\nreference today. They found that the cohomology theories for groups, associative algebras and Lie\nalgebras could all be described by derived functors, defined by means of projective and injective\nresolutions of modules. However the method they used was not enough to define the cohomology\nof commutative algebras. To overcome this problem, simplicial techniques were developed in\nhomological algebra.\nIn the 1950\u2019s Moore showed that every simplicial group K is a Kan complex whose homotopy\ngroups are the homology of a chain complex called the Moore complex of K. Dold and Kan\nindependently found that there is an equivalence between the category of simplicial abelian groups\nand the category of non-negative chain complexes of abelian groups given by the Moore complex.\nUsing simplicial methods Dold and Puppe showed that one can define the derived functors of a\nnon-additive functor, since simplicial homotopy doesn\u2019t involve addition.\nThe notion of a monad on a category traces back to R. Godement [9]. Around 1965, Barr and\nBeck used comonads to define a resolution as a way to compute nonabelian derived functors. In\n1967, Andr\u00b4e and Quillen independently developed what we now call Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology.\nThe Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology is defined in general for algebras, using comonads. The \u03bb-rings\nand \u03a8-rings are particular examples which are included in this scheme, so the Andr\u00b4e-Quillen\ncohomology is well defined for both \u03bb-rings and \u03a8-rings. The main difficulty is that the Andr\u00b4eQuillen cohomology is complicated and difficult to compute. Harrison had described a cohomology\nfor commutative algebras in 1962 using a subcomplex of the Hochschild complex. The Harrison\ncohomology coincides with the Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology over a field of characteristic zero up to\na dimension shift. Our aim is to develop tools which aid computation.\nIn 2004, Yau [20] defined a cohomology for \u03bb-rings in order to study deformations of the\nassociated \u03a8-operations. However, Yau\u2019s cohomology for \u03bb-rings is different from the Andr\u00b4eQuillen cohomology.\n\n\n5\n\n\n##### 1.1 Outline of the thesis\n\nIn Chapter 2, we give a short overview of some of the fundamental concepts of homological algebra.\nWe can trace the roots of these concepts back to Cartan and Eilenberg in the 1950\u2019s. We provide\nthe definitions of additive categories, abelian categories and short exact sequences in abelian categories. We outline the construction of the right derived functor Ext [i] using projective and injective\nresolutions. The main references for this part of the chapter are [19] and [17]. We sketch the construction of the cohomology of algebras in general using comonads [19] and we give the example\nof the Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology for commutative rings which are the right derived functors of\nthe derivations functor [18]. We provide an overview of the Harrison cohomology of commutative\nalgebras [10] and the Baues-Wirsching cohomology of a small category with coefficients in a natural\nsystem [4].\nChapter 2 only provides well known background material which will be required later. It does\nnot contain any original work. The original research can be found in the remaining chapters of the\nthesis.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we turn our attention to \u03a8-rings, which are related to \u03bb-rings via the Adam\u2019s\noperations. The first section introduces the basic concept of a \u03a8-ring which can be found in [14].\nWe then develop the \u03a8-analogue of modules and the semidirect product. These are then used to\ndevelop the \u03a8-analogue of derivations and extensions. The results from this chapter are needed in\nchapter 4 to prove similar results for \u03bb-rings.\nIn 2005, Donald Yau published a paper entitled, \u201cCohomology of \u03bb-rings\u201d [20]. In the paper\nhe develops a cohomology of \u03bb-rings in order to study the deformations of the \u03a8-ring structure.\nYau\u2019s cohomology is different from the Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology. In the last section of Chapter\n3 I provide a definition of the deformation of a \u03a8-ring which is different to Yau\u2019s definition. This\nalternative definition is related to the Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology of \u03a8-rings.\nIn Chapter 4, we introduce \u03bb-rings. The first section introduces the basic notions of \u03bb-rings\nwhich can be found in [14]. We then develop the \u03bb-analogue of modules and the semidirect product.\nWe then use these to develop the \u03bb-analogue of derivations and extensions. The last section of\nChapter 4 provides an overview of Yau\u2019s cohomology for \u03bb-rings.\nIn Chapter 5, we extend the Harrison cochain complex of a commutative algebra to get a bicomplex whose cohomology we define to be the Harrison cohomology of a diagram of a commutative\nalgebra. We then apply this theory to the case of \u03a8-rings.\nIn Chapter 6, we develop a cohomology for diagrams of algebras in general, using comonads.\nFirst, we fix a small category I. A diagram of algebras is a functor I \u2192 Alg(T ), where T is a monad\non sets. For appropriate T, we get a diagram of groups, a diagram of Lie algebras, a diagram of\ncommutative rings, etc. The adjoint pair Alg(T ) \ufffd Sets yields a comonad which we denote\nby G. We can also consider the category I 0, which has the same objects as I, but only the identity\nmorphisms. The inclusion I 0 \u2282 I yields the functor Sets [I] \u2192 Sets [I] [0] which has a left adjoint given\nby the left Kan extension. We also have the pair of adjoint functors Alg(T ) [I] \ufffd Sets I which\n\n\ncomes from the adjoint pair Alg(T ) \ufffd Sets . By putting these pairs together, we get another\nadjoint pair\nAlg(T ) [I] \ufffd Sets I 0 .\n\n\nThis adjoint pair yields a comonad which we denote by G I . We can then take the cohomology\nassociated to the comonad G I . Now we have both a global cohomology, H G [\u2217] I [(][A, M] [), and a local]\ncohomology, H G [\u2217] [(][A][(][i][)][, M] [(][i][)). Our main result is that there exists a local to global spectral sequence]\nconnecting the two:\nE 2 [pq] [=][ H] BW [p] [(][I,][ H] [q] [(][A, M] [))][ \u21d2] [H] G [p][+] I [q] [(][A, M] [)][,]\n\n\nwhere H BW [p] [(][I,][ H] [q] [(][A, M] [)) denotes the Baues-Wirsching cohomology of the small category][ I][ with]\ncoefficients in the natural system H [q] (A, M ) on I whose value on (\u03b1 : i \u2192 j) is given by\nH [q]\nG [(][A][(][i][)][, \u03b1] [\u2217] [M] [(][j][)).]\nIn Chapter 7, we apply our theory from Chapter 6 to the case of \u03a8-rings. A \u03a8-ring can be\nconsidered as a diagram of a commutative ring, so we can apply our results to get a cohomology\nfor \u03a8-rings. We also define the cohomology of \u03bb-rings using comonads. We note that there are\nhomomorphisms connecting the cohomology of \u03bb-rings, the cohomology of the associated \u03a8-rings\nand the Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology of the underlying commutative rings.\n\n\n6\n\n\nThe last Chapter looks at applications of the earlier developed theory. Our main application\nis in algebraic topology. For any topological space X such that K [1] (X) = 0, there exists a homomorphism natural in X, \u03c4 : \u03c0 2n\u22121 (X) \u2192 Ext \u03a8 (K(X), K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] )). We show that the cohomology\nof \u03bb-rings and \u03a8-rings can be used to prove the classical result of Adams. We also show that the\n\u03a8-ring cohomology of K(S [2][n] ) is related to the stable homotopy groups of spheres via the natural\ntransformation \u03c4 .\n\n\n7\n\n\n## Chapter 2\n\n# Homological algebra\n\n##### 2.1 Category theory\n\n2.1.1 Abelian categories\n\n\nThe material in this section can be found in many textbooks, including [16] and [19]. Before we\nintroduce abelian categories, we start by defining the notion of an additive category.\nAn additive category A is a category such that the following holds:\n\n\n1. for every pair of objects X and Y in A, the hom-set Hom A (X, Y ) has the structure of an\nabelian group such that morphism composition distributes over addition.\n\n\n2. A has a zero object (an object which is both initial and terminal).\n\n\n3. for every pair of objects X and Y in A, their product X \u00d7 Y exists.\n\n\nAn abelian category is defined in terms of kernels and cokernels, so first we will recall some\nother basic definitions from category theory.\nIn a category C, a morphism m : X \u2192 Y is called a monomorphism if for all morphisms\nf 1, f 2 : V \u2192 X where m \u25e6 f 1 = m \u25e6 f 2 we have f 1 = f 2 . A morphism e : Y \u2192 X is called an\nepimorphism if for all morphisms g 1, g 2 : X \u2192 V where g 1 \u25e6 e = g 2 \u25e6 e we have g 1 = g 2 .\nIn an additive category A, a kernel of a morphism f : X \u2192 Y is defined to be a map i : X [\u2032] \u2192 X\nsuch that f \u25e6 i = 0 and for any morphism g : Z \u2192 X such that f \u25e6 g = 0 there exists a unique\nmorphism g [\u2032] : Z \u2192 X [\u2032] such that i \u25e6 g [\u2032] = g.\n\n\nZ\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ng [\u2032]\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd 0 \ufffd [\ufffd] \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ng\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\nX [\u2032] \ufffd X \ufffd Y\ni f\n\n\nDually, in an additive category A, a cokernel of a morphism f : X \u2192 Y is defined to be a map\ne : Y \u2192 Y [\u2032] such that e \u25e6 f = 0 and for any morphism g : Y \u2192 Z such that g \u25e6 f = 0 there exists a\nunique morphism g [\u2032] : Y [\u2032] \u2192 Z such that g [\u2032] \u25e6 e = g.\n\n\nZ\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\nX \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd 0 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd g \ufffd\n\n\ufffd Y \ufffd\nf\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\n\ng [\u2032]\n\n\n\ufffd e \ufffd Y \u2032\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\nAn abelian category A is an additive category such that the following holds:\n\n\n1. every morphism in A has a kernel and cokernel.\n\n\n2. every monomorphism in A is the kernel of its cokernel.\n\n\n3. every epimorphism in A is the cokernel of its kernel.\n\n\n8\n\n\nThe basic example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups, denoted by Ab. In\nthe category Ab, the objects are Abelian groups, and the morphisms are abelian group homomorphisms. In general, module categories which appear throughout algebra, are abelian categories.\nIf I is a small category and A is an abelian category then the category of functors A [I] as also\nan abelian category. The category of sets Sets and the category of groups Grp are not abelian\ncategories. However, if G is a group then the category of left (or right) G-modules, denoted by\nG \u2212 mod, is an abelian category. If R is a ring then the category of left (or right) R-modules,\ndenoted by R \u2212 mod, is an abelian category. If R is a \u03a8-ring then the category of \u03a8-modules over\nR, denoted by R \u2212 mod \u03a8, is an abelian category. If R is a \u03bb-ring then the category of \u03bb-modules\nover R, denoted by R \u2212 mod \u03bb, is an abelian category.\nIn an abelian category A, a short exact sequence is a sequence\n\n\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n0 \ufffd A \ufffd B \ufffd C \ufffd 0\n\n\nin which \u03b1 is a monomorphism, \u03b2 is an epimorphism and Ker(\u03b2) = Im(\u03b1).\nIn an abelian category A, a sequence\n\n\n. . . \ufffd X n\u22121 [f] [ n][\u2212][1] \ufffd X n f [n] \ufffd X n+1 \ufffd . . .\n\n\nis said to be exact at X [n] if Ker(f [n] ) = Im(f [n][\u2212][1] ). The sequence is said to be exact if it is exact at\nX [n] for all n \u2208 Z.\n\n\n2.1.2 Modules\n\n\nLet C be a (not necessarily abelian) category with finite limits, and 1 denote a terminal object in\nC.

Harrison introduced a cohomology of commutative algebras. The Harrison complex\nis a subcomplex of the Hochschild complex in the case of commutative algebras. The Harrison\ncomplex consists of the linear functions which vanish on the shuffles. The Harrison cohomology is\nisomorphic to the comonad cohomology for a commutative algebra over a field of characteristic 0,\nhowever, there is a shift of one dimension.

Note that in all of the cited material, including [1], [14] and\n\n[20], what the authors call a \u03a8-ring is what we call a special \u03a8-ring. Also note that in our notation\nN does not include 0.\n\u03bb-rings are complicated, and given a \u03bb-ring it is often difficult to prove it satisfies the \u03bb-ring\naxioms. We start by introducing another kind of ring, the \u03a8-rings, which are closely related to the\n\u03bb-rings by the Adams operations. The axioms for the \u03a8-rings are a lot simpler than those for the\n\u03bb-rings.\n\n\nDefinition 3.1. A \u03a8-ring is a commutative ring with identity, R, together with a sequence of\nring homomorphisms \u03a8 [i] : R \u2192 R, for i \u2208 N, satisfying\n\n\n1. \u03a8 [1] (r) = r,\n\n\n2. \u03a8 [i] (\u03a8 [j] (r)) = \u03a8 [ij] (r),\n\n\nfor all r \u2208 R, and i, j \u2208 N.\n\n\nWe say that a \u03a8-ring R is special if it also satisfies the property\n\n\n\u03a8 [p] (r) \u2261 r [p] mod pR,\n\n\nfor all primes p and r \u2208 R.\n\n\nExample 3.2. Any commutative ring with identity, R, can be given a \u03a8-ring structure by setting\n\u03a8 [i] : R \u2192 R to be \u03a8 [i] (r) = r for all r \u2208 R and i \u2208 N.\n\n\nLet R 1, R 2 be \u03a8-rings. A map of \u03a8-rings is a ring homomorphism f : R 1 \u2192 R 2, such that\n\u03a8 [i] (f (r)) = f (\u03a8 [i] (r)) for all r \u2208 R 1 and i \u2208 N. The class of all \u03a8-rings and maps of \u03a8-rings form\nthe category of \u03a8-rings, which we denote by \u03a8\u2212rings.\n\n##### 3.2 \u03a8-modules\n\n\nFor usual rings, the modules provide us with the coefficients for the cohomology. In this section we\ndefine the \u03a8-modules for \u03a8-rings which provide us with the coefficients for the \u03a8-ring cohomology.\nWe then use this to create the \u03a8-analogue of some of the results for rings.\n\n\nDefinition 3.3. We say that M is a \u03a8-module over the \u03a8-ring R if M is an R-module together\nwith a sequence of abelian group homomorphisms \u03c8 [i] : M \u2192 M, for i \u2208 N, satisfying\n\n\n1. \u03c8 [1] (m) = m,\n\n\n2. \u03c8 [i] (rm) = \u03a8 [i] (r)\u03c8 [i] (m),\n\n\n3. \u03c8 [i] (\u03c8 [j] (m)) = \u03c8 [ij] (m),\n\n\n24\n\n\nfor all m \u2208 M, r \u2208 R, and i, j \u2208 N.\nLet M, N be two \u03a8-modules over R. A map of \u03a8-modules is a module homomorphism f : M \u2192\nN such that \u03c8 [i] f (m) = f\u03c8 [i] (m) for all m \u2208 M and i \u2208 N. We let R\u2212mod \u03a8 denote the category of\nall \u03a8-modules over R.\n\n\nWe say that M is special if R is special and\n\n\n\u03c8 [p] (m) \u2261 0 mod pM,\n\n\nfor all primes p and m \u2208 M .\nNote that any \u03a8-ring can be considered as a \u03a8-module over itself. Also note that if M is\nspecial, then \u03c8 [i] (m) \u2261 0 mod iM for all i \u2208 N and m \u2208 M .\nFor the rest of this chapter, we let R denote a \u03a8-ring and M \u2208 R\u2212mod \u03a8 . We let R denote the\nunderlying commutative ring of R, and we let M denote the underlying R-module of M .\n\n\nLemma 3.4. The set R \u22ca M with\n\n\n(r, m) + (s, n) = (r + s, m + n),\n\n\n(r, m)(s, n) = (rs, rn + ms),\n\n\ntogether with maps \u03a8 [i] : R \u22ca M \u2192 R \u22ca M for i \u2208 N given by\n\n\n\u03a8 [i] (r, m) = (\u03a8 [i] (r), \u03c8 [i] (m) + \u03b5 [i] (r)),\n\n\nfor a sequence of maps \u03b5 [i] : R \u2192 M for i \u2208 N, is a \u03a8-ring if and only if\n\n\n1. \u03b5 [1] (r) = 0,\n\n\n2. \u03b5 [i] (r + s) = \u03b5 [i] (r) + \u03b5 [i] (s),\n\n\n3. \u03b5 [i] (rs) = \u03a8 [i] (r)\u03b5 [i] (s) + \u03b5 [i] (r)\u03a8 [i] (s),\n\n\n4. \u03b5 [ij] (r) = \u03c8 [i] \u03b5 [j] (r) + \u03b5 [i] \u03a8 [j] (r),\n\n\nfor all r, s \u2208 R, and i, j \u2208 N.\n\n\nProof of lemma. It is known that R \u22ca M is a commutative ring with identity. Hence it is sufficient\nto check that \u03a8 [i] : R \u22ca M \u2192 R \u22ca M satisfies the \u03a8-ring axioms.\n\n\n1. \u03a8 [1] (r, m) = (\u03a8 [1] (r), \u03c8 [1] (m) + \u03b5 [1] (r)) = (r, m + \u03b5 [1] (r))\nHence \u03a8 [1] (r, m) = (r, m) if and only if \u03b5 [1] (r) = 0.\n\n\n2. \u03a8 [i] ((r, m) + (s, n)) = (\u03a8 [i] (r) + \u03a8 [i] (s), \u03c8 [i] (m) + \u03c8 [i] (n) + \u03b5 [i] (r + s))\n\u03a8 [i] (r, m) + \u03a8 [i] (s, n) = (\u03a8 [i] (r) + \u03a8 [i] (s), \u03c8 [i] (m) + \u03c8 [i] (n) + \u03b5 [i] (r) + \u03b5 [i] (s))\nHence \u03a8 [i] ((r, m) + (s, n)) = \u03a8 [i] (r, m) + \u03a8 [i] (s, n) if and only if\n\u03b5 [i] (r + s) = \u03b5 [i] (r) + \u03b5 [i] (s).\n\n\n3. \u03a8 [i] ((r, m)(s, n)) = (\u03a8 [i] (rs), \u03c8 [i] (rn + ms) + \u03b5 [i] (rs))\n\u03a8 [i] (r, m)\u03a8 [i] (s, n) = (\u03a8 [i] (rs), \u03c8 [i] (rn + ms) + \u03a8 [i] (r)\u03b5 [i] (s) + \u03b5 [i] (r)\u03a8 [i] (s))\nHence \u03a8 [i] ((r, m)(s, n)) = \u03a8 [i] (r, m)\u03a8 [i] (s, n) if and only if\n\u03b5 [i] (rs) = \u03a8 [i] (r)\u03b5 [i] (s) + \u03b5 [i] (r)\u03a8 [i] (s).\n\n\n4. \u03a8 [i] \u03a8 [j] (r, m) = (\u03a8 [i] \u03a8 [j] (r), \u03c8 [i] \u03c8 [j] (m) + \u03c8 [i] \u03b5 [j] (r) + \u03b5 [i] \u03a8 [j] (r))\n\u03a8 [ij] (r, m) = (\u03a8 [i] \u03a8 [j] (r), \u03c8 [i] \u03c8 [j] (m) + \u03b5 [ij] (r))\nHence \u03a8 [i] \u03a8 [j] (r, m) = \u03a8 [ij] (r, m) if and only if \u03b5 [ij] (r) = \u03c8 [i] \u03b5 [j] (r)) + \u03b5 [i] \u03a8 [j] (r).\n\n\nThe maps \u03b5 [i] : R \u2192 M given by \u03b5 [i] (r) = 0, for all r \u2208 R and i \u2208 N, satisfy properties 3.4.1-3.4.4\nmeaning that the maps \u03a8 [i] : R \u22ca M \u2192 R \u22ca M given by \u03a8 [i] (r, m) = (\u03a8 [i] (r), \u03c8 [i] (m)) give us a \u03a8-ring\nstructure on R \u22ca M . We call this the semi-direct product of R and M, denoted by R \u22ca \u03a8 M .\nWe note that if R and M are both special, then R \u22ca \u03a8 M is also special.\n\n\n25\n\n\n##### 3.3 \u03a8-derivations\n\nThe Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology for commutative rings is given by the derived functors of the\nderivations functor. For a commutative ring S, the derivations of S with values in an S-module N\n\n\u03c0\nare in one-to-one correspondence with the sections of S \u22ca N \ufffd S . We define the \u03a8-derivations\n\n\n\u03c0\nand show that they are in one-to-one correspondence with the sections of R \u22ca \u03a8 M \ufffd R .\n\n\nDefinition 3.5. A \u03a8-derivation of R with values in M is an additive homomorphism d : R \u2192 M\nsuch that\n\n\n1. d(rs) = rd(s) + d(r)s,\n\n\n2. \u03c8 [i] (d(r)) = d(\u03a8 [i] (r)),\n\n\nfor all r, s \u2208 R, and i \u2208 N. We let Der \u03a8 (R, M ) denote the set of all \u03a8-derivations of R with values\nin M .\n\n\nExample 3.6. Let R and M be such that \u03a8 [i] = Id = \u03c8 [i] for all i \u2208 N, then\n\n\nDer \u03a8 (R, M ) = Der(R, M ).\n\n\nTheorem 3.7. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of Der \u03a8 (R, M ) and the\n\n\n\u03c0\nsections of R \u22ca \u03a8 M \ufffd R .\n\n\nProof of theorem. Assume we have a section of \u03c0, then we have the following\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n\ufffd\nR \u22ca \u03a8 M R,\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nwhere \u03c0\u03c3 = Id R . Hence \u03c3(r) = (r, d(r)) for some d : R \u2192 M . The properties\n\n\nd(r + s) =d(r) + d(s),\nd(rs) =d(r)s + rd(s),\n\n\nfollow from \u03c3 being a ring homomorphism. However \u03c3 also preserves the \u03a8-ring structure, so we\nget that \u03a8 [i] \u03c3(r) = \u03c3\u03a8 [i] (r). We know that\n\n\n\u03a8 [i] \u03c3(r) = \u03a8 [i] (r, d(r)) = (\u03a8 [i] (r), \u03c8 [i] (d(r))),\n\n\n\u03c3\u03a8 [i] (r) = (\u03a8 [i] (r), d(\u03a8 [i] (r))).\n\nHence \u03a8 [i] \u03c3(r) = \u03c3\u03a8 [i] (r) if and only if \u03c8 [i] d(r) = d\u03a8 [i] (r). This tells us that if \u03c3 is a section of \u03c0,\nthen we have a \u03a8-derivation d.\nConversely, if we have a \u03a8-derivation d : R \u2192 M, then \u03c3(r) = (r, d(r)) is a section of \u03c0.\n\n##### 3.4 \u03a8-ring extensions\n\n\nWe have seen in proposition 2.13 that the Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology H AQ [1] [(][R, M] [) classifies the]\nextensions of R by M. In this section, we develop the \u03a8-analogue of extensions.\n\n\nDefinition 3.8.

A class in Ext \u03a8 (R, M )\nor AExt \u03a8 (R, M ) belongs to the kernel of u if the underlying class is the trivial class. The additively\nand multiplicatively split extensions are precisely the \u03a8-ring extensions whose underlying extension\nis trivial. Exactness follows.\n\n\nFrom the definitions, we see that Ext \u03a8 (R, M ) \u2287 AExt \u03a8 (R, M ) \u2287 MExt \u03a8 (R, M ).\nIf R and M are both special, then we say that a \u03a8-ring extension\n\n\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n0 \ufffd M \ufffd X \ufffd R \ufffd 0\n\n\nis special if X is also special.\nWe denote the set of equivalence classes of the special \u03a8-ring extensions of R by M by\nExt \u03a8 s (R, M ). Similarly, we can define AExt \u03a8 s (R, M ) and MExt \u03a8 s (R, M ).\n\n##### 3.5 Crossed \u03a8-extensions\n\n\nA crossed \u03a8-module consists of a \u03a8-ring C 0, a \u03a8-module C 1 over C 0 and a map of \u03a8-modules\n\n\n\u2202\nC 1 \ufffd C 0,\n\n\nwhich satisfies the property\n\u2202(c)c [\u2032] = c\u2202(c [\u2032] ),\n\n\nfor c, c [\u2032] \u2208 C 1 . In other words, a crossed \u03a8-module is a chain algebra which is non-trivial only\nin dimensions 0 and 1. Since C 2 = 0 the condition \u2202(c)c [\u2032] = c\u2202(c [\u2032] ) is equivalent to the Leibnitz\nrelation\n0 = \u2202(cc [\u2032] ) = \u2202(c)c [\u2032] \u2212 c\u2202(c [\u2032] ).\n\n\nWe can define a product by\nc \u2217 c [\u2032] := \u2202(c)c [\u2032],\n\n\nfor c, c [\u2032] \u2208 C 1 . This gives us a \u03a8-ring structure on C 1 and \u2202 : C 1 \u2192 C 0 is a map of \u03a8-rings.\nLet \u2202 : C 1 \u2192 C 0 be a crossed \u03a8-module. We let M = Ker(\u2202) and R = Coker(\u2202) Then the\nimage Im(\u2202) is an ideal of C 0, MC 1 = C 1 M = 0 and M has a well-defined \u03a8-module structure\nover R.\n\nA crossed \u03a8-extension of R by M is an exact sequence\n\n\n0 \ufffd M \u03b1 \ufffd C 1 \u2202 \ufffd C 0 \u03b3 \ufffd R \ufffd 0\n\n\nwhere \u2202 : C 1 \u2192 C 0 is a crossed \u03a8-module, \u03b3 is a map of \u03a8-rings, and the \u03a8-module structure\non M coincides with the one induced from the crossed \u03a8-module. We denote the category of\ncrossed \u03a8-extensions of R by M by Cross \u03a8 (R, M ). We let \u03c0 0 Cross \u03a8 (R, M ) denote the connected\ncomponents of the category Cross \u03a8 (R, M ).\nAn additively split crossed \u03a8-extension of R by M is a crossed \u03a8-extension\n\n\n\u03c9 \u03c1 \u03c0\n0 \ufffd M \ufffd C 1 \ufffd C 0 \ufffd R \ufffd 0 (3.1)\n\n\n28\n\n\nsuch that all the arrows in the exact sequence 3.1 are additively split.

Here, I provide an alternative definition to Yau\u2019s\ndefinition. A deformation of the \u03a8-operations should be a \u03a8-ring deformation (\u03b1 t, \u03a8 [\u2217] t [) where][ \u03b1] [t]\nis the trivial deformation.

Note that in our notation N 0 = N \u222a{0}.\nIn this chapter, we start by introducing the concept of a pre-\u03bb-ring. After giving the definition,\nwe will look at some examples of pre-\u03bb-rings. Later, we introduce the definition of \u03bb-rings, which\nare pre-\u03bb-rings which satisfy some additional axioms. Then we will look at which of the pre-\u03bb-ring\nstructures also give us \u03bb-rings.\n\n\nDefinition 4.1. A pre-\u03bb-ring is a commutative ring R with identity 1, together with a sequence\nof operations \u03bb [i] : R \u2192 R, for i \u2208 N 0, satisfying\n\n\n1. \u03bb [0] (r) = 1,\n\n\n2. \u03bb [1] (r) = r,\n\n\n3. \u03bb [i] (r + s) = \u03a3 [i] k=0 [\u03bb] [k] [(][r][)][\u03bb] [i][\u2212][k] [(][s][),]\n\n\nfor all r, s \u2208 R and i \u2208 N 0 .\n\n\nTo be able to describe examples of pre-\u03bb-rings or \u03bb-rings it is often useful to consider, for r \u2208 R,\nthe formal power series in the variable t\n\n\n\n\u03bb t (r) =\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd \u03bb [i] (r)t [i]\n\n\ni=0\n\n\n\n= \u03bb [0] (r) + \u03bb [1] (r)t + \u03bb [2] (r)t [2] + . . .\n\n\nNote that\n\n\n\u03bb t (r + s) = \u03bb [0] (r + s) + \u03bb [1] (r + s)t + \u03bb [2] (r + s)t [2] + \u03bb [3] (r + s)t [3] . . .\n\n= 1 + (r + s)t + \u03a3 [2] k=0 [\u03bb] [k] [(][r][)][\u03bb] [2][\u2212][k] [(][s][)][t] [2] [ + \u03a3] k [3] =0 [\u03bb] [k] [(][r][)][\u03bb] [3][\u2212][k] [(][s][)][t] [3] [ +][ . . .]\n\n= (1 + rt + \u03bb [2] (r)t [2] + . . .)(1 + st + \u03bb [2] (s)t [2] + . . .)\n\n\n= \u03bb t (r)\u03bb t (s).\n\n\nThis gives us an equivalent definition of a pre-\u03bb-ring.\n\n\nDefinition 4.2. A pre-\u03bb-ring is a commutative ring R with identity 1, together with a sequence\nof operations \u03bb [i] : R \u2192 R, for i \u2208 N 0, satisfying\n\n\n1. \u03bb [0] (r) = 1,\n\n\n2. \u03bb [1] (r) = r,\n\n\n3. \u03bb t (r + s) = \u03bb t (r)\u03bb t (s), where \u03bb t (r) = [\ufffd] i\u22650 [\u03bb] [i] [(][r][)][t] [i] [,]\n\n\nfor all r, s \u2208 R and i \u2208 N 0 .\n\n\n31\n\n\nExample 4.3.

A \u03bb-ring is a commutative ring R with identity 1, together with a sequence of\noperations \u03bb [i] : R \u2192 R, for i \u2208 N 0, satisfying\n\n\n1.

In general,\nP k,j \u0338= P j,k, so the \u03bb-operations do not commute.\n\n\nExample 4.7. The simplest example of a \u03bb-ring is Z, together with binomial coefficients \u03bb [i] (r) =\n\ufffd ri \ufffd. The additional axioms for \u03bb-rings eliminate the more exotic pre-\u03bb-ring structures. From 4.3,\nthe only \u03bb-rings are taking \u03bb t (r) = (1 + t) [r], which gives us a \u03bb-ring structure on Z or R.\n\n\nCorollary 4.8 (Some properties of \u03bb-rings). 1.

This follows from 4.6.1.\n\n\n32\n\n\nA map of \u03bb-rings R 1 \u2192 R 2, is a ring homomorphism f : R 1 \u2192 R 2, such that\n\u03bb [i] (f (r)) = f (\u03bb [i] (r)) for all r \u2208 R 1 and i \u2208 N 0 . The class of all \u03bb-rings and maps of \u03bb-rings form\nthe category of \u03bb-rings, which we denote by \u03bb\u2212rings.\nThe \u03bb-operations are often difficult to work with as they are neither additive nor multiplicative.\nWe can get ring maps from the \u03bb-operations, which are the Adams operations \u03a8 [i] : R \u2192 R for\ni \u2208 N, defined by the Newton formula\n\n\n\u03a8 [i] (r) \u2212 \u03bb [1] (r)\u03a8 [i][\u2212][1] (r) + . . . + (\u22121) [i][\u2212][1] \u03bb [i][\u2212][1] (r)\u03a8 [1] (r) + (\u22121) [i] i\u03bb [i] (r) = 0.\n\n\nExample 4.9.

If R is a \u03bb-ring then the Adams operations give us a special \u03a8-ring structure on\nR, which we denote by R \u03a8 .\n\n\nWe will require the following useful theorem from [14] (p.49).\n\n\nTheorem 4.11. Let R be a torsion-free pre-\u03bb-ring. Let \u03a8 [i] : R \u2192 R be the corresponding Adams\noperations. If R together with the \u03a8-operations form a \u03a8-ring, then R is a \u03bb-ring.\n\n\nThe proof of this theorem can also be found in [14].\n\n\nExample 4.12. Consider the simplest example of a \u03bb-ring, Z, together with binomial coefficients\n\u03bb [i] (r) = \ufffd ri \ufffd. The Adams operations give us \u03a8 [i] (r) = r for all r \u2208 Z and i \u2208 N, which we have\nalready seen gives us a \u03a8-ring structure on Z.\n\n##### 4.2 \u03bb-modules\n\n\nFor usual rings, we have modules which provide us with the coefficients for the cohomology. We now\ndefine the \u03bb-modules for \u03bb-rings which provide us with the coefficients for the \u03bb-ring cohomology.\n\n\nDefinition 4.13. M is a \u03bb-module over the \u03bb-ring R if M is an R-module together with a sequence\nof abelian group homomorphisms \u039b [i] : M \u2192 M, for i \u2208 N, satisfying\n\n\n1. \u039b [1] (m) = m,\n\n\n33\n\n\n2. \u039b [i] (rm) = \u03a8 [i] (r)\u039b [i] (m),\n\n\n3. \u039b [ij] (m) = (\u22121) [(][i][+1)(][j][+1)] \u039b [i] \u039b [j] (m),\n\n\nfor all m \u2208 M, r \u2208 R and i, j \u2208 N.\nLet M, N be two \u03bb-modules over R. A map of \u03bb-modules is a module homomorphism f : M \u2192\nN such that \u039b [i] f (m) = f \u039b [i] (m) for all m \u2208 M and i \u2208 N 0 . We let R\u2212mod \u03bb denote the category of\nall \u03bb-modules over R.\n\n\nThe main motivation for our definition of a \u03bb-module is as follows. First we let R and X be\ntwo \u03bb-rings and \u03b2 : X \u2192 R be a map of \u03bb-rings. Assume M = Ker \u03b2 is a square-zero ideal. Since\n\u03bb [i] (0) = 0, for i > 0, there are maps \u039b [i] : M \u2192 M, for i > 0, which make the following diagram\n\ncommutes:\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd R\n\n\n\u03bb [i]\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n0 \ufffd M \ufffd\n\n\n\u039b [i]\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\n\ufffd \ufffd X\n\n\n\u03bb [i]\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd 0\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n0 M X R 0.\n\n\nThe properties of the \u039b-operations follow from the properties of the \u03bb-operations. For example,\n\n\n\u03b1\u03bb [i] (rm) =\u03bb [i] \u03b1(rm)\n\n=\u03bb [i] (x\u03b1(m)),\n\n\nfor some x \u2208 X with \u03b2(x) = r. Therefore,\n\n\n\u03b1\u03bb [i] (rm) = P i (\u03bb [1] (x), . . ., \u03bb [i] (x), \u03bb [1] (\u03b1(m)), . . . \u03bb [i] (\u03b1(m))).\n\n\nHowever \u03b1(m)\u03b1(n) = 0 for all m, n \u2208 M so most of the terms vanish leaving\n\n\n\u03b1\u03bb [i] (rm) = \u03b1\u03a8 [i] (r)\u039b [i] (m).\n\n\nFor the rest of this chapter, we let R denote a \u03bb-ring and M \u2208 R \u2212 mod \u03bb . We let R denote the\nunderlying commutative ring of R, and M denote the underlying R-module of M .\n\n\nExample 4.14. In general, R is not a \u03bb-module over itself unless the multiplication in R is trivial.\nHowever we can consider the sequence of operations \u039b [i] : R \u2192 R given by \u039b [i] (r) = (\u22121) [(][i][+1)] \u03a8 [i] (r).\nWith these \u039b-operations R is a \u03bb-module over R.\n\n\nTheorem 4.15.

Given an additively and multiplicatively split crossed extension of A by M we get that (with\nthe notation of lemma 5.11) g i = 0 for all i \u2208 I. Since \u03c1(i) is additively and multiplicatively split for\nall i \u2208 I it follows that f = 0, \u03b8 = 0 and \u03d1 = 0.

In this chapter, we define a cohomology for diagrams of algebras. Our approach can\nbe described as follows. First, we fix a small category I. A diagram of algebras is a functor\nI \u2192 Alg(T ), where T is a monad on sets. For appropriate T, one gets a diagram of groups, a\ndiagram of Lie algebras, a diagram of commutative rings, etc. The adjoint pair Alg(T ) \ufffd Sets\nyields a comonad which we denote by G. We can also consider the category I 0, which has the\nsame objects as I, but only the identity morphisms. The inclusion I 0 \u2282 I yields the functor\nSets [I] \u2192 Sets [I] [0] which has a left adjoint given by the left Kan extension. We also have the pair\nof adjoint functors Alg(T ) [I] \ufffd Sets I which comes from the adjoint pair Alg(T ) \ufffd Sets .\nBy gluing these diagrams together, one gets another adjoint pair\n\n\nAlg(T ) [I] \ufffd Sets I 0 .\n\n\nThis adjoint pair yields a comonad which we denote by G I . We will prove that Alg(T ) [I] is monadic\nin Sets [I] [0] and the right cohomology theory of diagrams of algebras is one which is associated to\nthe comonad G I . These cohomology theories are denoted by H G [\u2217] I [(][A, M] [).]\n\n##### 6.1 Base change\n\n\nLet C be a category, and X be an object in C.

Given a crossed extension we have a crossed module\n\n\n\u2202\nC 1 \ufffd C 0 .\n\n\nLet X 0 = C 0 and X 1 = C 1 \u2295 C 0 where addition is given by (c 1, c 0 )+(d 1, d 0 ) = (c 1 + d 1, c 0 + d 0 )\nand multiplication is given by (c 1, c 0 )(d 1, d 0 ) = (0, c 0 d 0 + \u2202(c 1 )d 1 + c 0 d 1 + d 0 c 1 ). For all \u03b1 : i \u2192 j\nthen we have X 1 (\u03b1)(c 0, d 0 ) = (C 1 (\u03b1)(c 1 ), C 0 (\u03b1)(c 0 )). This gives us that X 1 is a diagram of\nalgebras. We set d 1 : X 1 \u2192 X 0 to be d 1 (c 1, c 0 ) = c 0 and d 0 : X 1 \u2192 X 0 to be d 0 (c 1, c 0 ) = \u2202(c 1 )+ c 0 .\nThen d 0 is a natural transformation.\nWe define the category C to be the category whose objects are the elements of X 0 and whose\nmorphisms are the elements of X 1 . The source of the morphism (c 1, c 0 ) \u2208 C is given by d 0 (c 1, c 0 ) =\n\u2202(c 1 ) + c 0 and the target of (c 1, c 0 ) \u2208 C is given by d 1 (c 1, c 0 ) = c 0 .

A diagram of groups is a functor][ G][ :][ I][ \u2192] [Gp][ where][ I][ is a small category and]\nGrp is the category of groups. A G-module is a functor M : I \u2192 Ab such that for all objects\ni \u2208 I we have that M (i) \u2208 A(i) \u2212 mod and for all morphisms (\u03b1 : i \u2192 j) \u2208 I we have that\nM (\u03b1)(gm) = G(\u03b1)(g) \u00b7 M (\u03b1)(m) for all g \u2208 G(i) and m \u2208 M (i).\nA derivation of G into M is a natural transformation d : G \u2192 M such that d(i) : G(i) \u2192 M (i)\nis a derivation of the group G(i) into M (i). We denote the abelian group of all derivations of G\ninto M by Der I (G, M ). When G is locally constant then H Cg [n][+1] [(][G, M] [) =][ R] [n] [ Der] [I] [(][G, M] [) and the]\nfollowing spectral sequence exists.\n\n\nE 2 [p,q] = H BW [p] [(][I,][ H] [q][+1] [(][G, M] [))][ \u21d2] [H] Cg [p][+][q][+1] (G, M ),\n\n\nwhere H [q] (G, M ) is a natural system on I whose value on (\u03b1 : i \u2192 j) is given by H [q] (G(i), \u03b1 [\u2217] M (j)).\nSo when G is locally constant the cohomology described by Cegarra coincides with the Andr\u00b4eQuillen cohomology described above with a dimension shift.\n\n\n64\n\n\n## Chapter 7\n\n# Andr\u00b4e-Quillen cohomology of \u03a8-rings and \u03bb-rings\n\n##### 7.1 Cohomology of \u03a8-rings\n\nLet I denote the category with one object associated to the multiplicative monoid of the nonzero\nnatural numbers. We can consider \u03a8-rings as diagrams of commutative rings; \u03a8-rings are functors\nfrom I to the category of commutative rings\n\n\nR : I \u2192 Com.rings.\n\n\nTherefore we can use the theory we developed in the previous chapter.\nWe are now going to construct the free \u03a8-ring on one generator a. Let A be the free commutative\nring generated by {a i |i \u2208 N}. Let the operations \u03a8 [i] : A \u2192 A be given by \u03a8 [i] (a j ) = a ij, for i, j \u2208 N.\nThen A is the free \u03a8-ring on one generator.\n\n\nLemma 7.1. If R and S are \u03a8-rings, then R \u2297 S with \u03a8 [i] : R \u2297 S \u2192 R \u2297 S given by \u03a8 [i] (r, s) =\n(\u03a8 [i] (r), \u03a8 [i] (s)) is the coproduct in the category \u03a8 \u2212 rings.\n\n\nProof. The coproduct of two commutative rings is given by the tensor product, so we only need\nto check the \u03a8-operations. There is a unique \u03a8-ring structure on R \u2297 S such that\n\n\nR \u2192 R \u2297 S, r \ufffd\u2192 r \u2297 1,\n\n\nS \u2192 R \u2297 S, s \ufffd\u2192 1 \u2297 s,\n\n\nare homomorphisms of \u03a8-rings given by\n\n\n\u03a8 [i] (r \u2297 s) = \u03a8 [i] ((r \u2297 1)(1 \u2297 s))\n\n= \u03a8 [i] (r \u2297 1)\u03a8 [i] (1 \u2297 s)\n\n= (\u03a8 [i] (r) \u2297 1)(1 \u2297 \u03a8 [i] (s))\n\n= \u03a8 [i] (r) \u2297 \u03a8 [i] (s).\n\n\nCorollary 7.2.

A lot of the basic theory for\nreal vector bundles is the same as for complex vector bundles, however we will only be concerned\nwith complex vector bundles in this chapter.\n\n\nDefinition 8.1. A complex vector bundle consists of\n\n\n1. topological spaces X (called the base space) and E (called the total space.)\n\n\n2. a continuous map p : E \u2192 X (called the projection.)\n\n\n3. a finite dimensional complex vector space structure on each\n\n\nE x = p [\u2212][1] (x) for x \u2208 X,\n\n\n(we call the p [\u2212][1] (x) the fibres)\n\n\nsuch that the following local triviality condition is satisfied. There exists an open cover of X by\nopen sets U \u03b1 and for each there exists a homeomorphism \u03d5 \u03b1 : p [\u2212][1] (U \u03b1 ) \u2192 U \u03b1 \u00d7 C [d] which takes\np [\u2212][1] (b) to {b} \u00d7 C [d] via a vector space isomorphism for each b \u2208 U \u03b1 .\n\n\nExample 8.2. Let E = X \u00d7 C [d], and p be the projection onto the first factor. We call this the\nproduct or trivial bundle.\n\n\nA homomorphism from a complex vector bundle p : E \u2192 X to another complex vector bundle\nq : F \u2192 X is a continuous map \u03d5 : E \u2192 F such that\n\n\n1. q\u03d5 = p,\n\n\n2. \u03d5 : E x \u2192 F x is a linear map of vector spaces for all x \u2208 X.\n\n\nIf \u03d5 is a bijection and \u03d5 [\u2212][1] is continuous, then we say that \u03d5 is an isomorphism and that E and\nF are isomorphic. We will let V ect(X) denote the set of isomorphism classes of complex vector\nbundles on X.\nLet E be a complex vector bundle over X. We get that dim(E x ) is locally constant on X,\nfurthermore it is a constant function on each of the connected components of X.\nFor vector bundles E, F we can define the following corresponding bundles\n\n\n  - E \u2295 F, the direct sum of E and F,\n\n\n  - E \u2297 F, the tensor product of E and F,\n\n\n  - \u03bb [k] (E), the k [th] exterior power of E.\n\n\n69\n\n\nThere exist the following natural isomorphisms\n\n\n  - E \u2295 F = [\u223c] F \u2295 E,\n\n\n  - E \u2297 F = [\u223c] F \u2297 E,\n\n\n  - E \u2297 (F \u2295 F [\u2032] ) [\u223c] = (E \u2297 F ) \u2295 (E \u2297 F [\u2032] ),\n\n\n  - \u03bb [k] (E \u2295 F ) = [\u223c] [\ufffd] i+j=k [(][\u03bb] [i] [(][E][)][ \u2297] [\u03bb] [j] [(][F] [)).]\n\n\n8.1.2 K-theory\n\n\nFor any space X, we can consider the set V ect(X) which has an abelian semigroup structure where\naddition is given by the direct sum. There is also a multiplication, given by tensor products, which\nis distributive over the addition of V ect(X) (this makes V ect(X) into a semiring.)\nIf A is an abelian semigroup, we can associate an abelian group K(A) to A. Let F (A) be the\nfree abelian group generated by A, and let E(A) be the subgroup of F (A) generated by elements\nof them form a + a [\u2032] \u2212 (a \u2295 a [\u2032] ), where a, a [\u2032] \u2208 A and \u2295 is the addition in A. We define the abelian\ngroup K(A) = F (A)/E(A). If A is a semiring, then K(A) is a ring.\nIf X is a space, then we will write K(X) for the ring K(V ect(X)). Let f : X \u2192 Y be a\ncontinuous map. Then f [\u2217] : V ect(Y ) \u2192 V ect(X) induces a ring homomorphism f [\u2217] : K(Y ) \u2192 K(X)\nwhich only depends on the homotopy class of f .\nWe can define operations \u03bb [k] : K(X) \u2192 K(X) using the exterior powers. These make K(X)\ninto a \u03bb-ring. We can then use these to define the Adams operations \u03a8 [k] : K(X) \u2192 K(X) which\nmakes K(X) into a \u03a8-ring.\nIf X is a compact space with distinguished basepoint, then we define K [\ufffd] (X) to be the kernel\nof i [\u2217] : K(X) \u2192 K(x 0 ) where i : x 0 \u2192 X is the inclusion of the basepoint. Let c : X \u2192 x 0 be the\ncollapsing map, then c [\u2217] induces a natural splitting K(X) = [\u223c] K [\ufffd] (X) \u2295 K(x 0 ).\n\n\nExample 8.3. K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] ) = [\u223c] Z[y]/(y) [2], where y is the n-fold external product (H \u2212 1) \u2217 . . . \u2217 (H \u2212 1)\nand H is the canonical line bundle of S [2] = CP [1] . Multiplication in K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] ) is trivial, and the\n\u03bb-operations \u03bb [k] : K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] ) \u2192 K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] ) are given by\n\n\n\u03bb [k] (x) = (\u22121) [k][\u2212][1] k [n][\u2212][1] x.\n\n\nHence the \u03a8-operations \u03a8 [k] : K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] ) \u2192 K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] ) are given by\n\n\n\u03a8 [k] (x) = k [n] x.\n\n##### 8.2 Natural transformation\n\n\nLet X, Y be topological spaces such that K [\ufffd] (Y ) = 0 and K [\ufffd] (\u03a3X) = 0. Let f : Y \u2192 X be a\ncontinuous map, then we can consider the Puppe exact sequence\n\n\nf\nY \ufffd X \ufffd C f \ufffd \u03a3Y \ufffd \u03a3X \ufffd \u03a3C f \ufffd . . .\n\n\nwhere\ufffd C f is the mapping cone of f, and \u03a3X is the suspension of X.

If X and Y are topological spaces as above then there exist natural transformations \u03c4 \u03bb : [Y, X] \u2192 Ext \u03bb (K(X), K [\ufffd] (\u03a3Y )) and \u03c4 \u03a8 : [Y, X] \u2192 Ext \u03a8 (K(X), K [\ufffd] (\u03a3Y )).\n\n\nCorollary 8.5. If X is a topological space such that K [\ufffd] (\u03a3X) = 0 then there exist natural transformations \u03c4 \u03bb,n : \u03c0 2n\u22121 (X) \u2192 Ext \u03bb (K(X), K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] )) and \u03c4 \u03a8,n : \u03c0 2n\u22121 (X) \u2192 Ext \u03a8 (K(X), K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] )).\n\n\n70\n\n\n##### 8.3 The Hopf invariant of an extension\n\nWe are going to give a proof of the classical result of Adams which was first proved by Adams,\nand subsequently by Adams-Atiyah [1]. We are going to use the same approach as Adams-Atiyah;\nusing \u03a8-rings.\n\n\nDefinition 8.6. Consider the commutative ring R which is free as an abelian group with generators\nx and y, R = [\u223c] Zx \u2295 Zy, where x is the unit of the ring and y [2] = 0. Let M = [\u223c] Zz be the R-module\nsuch that y \u00b7 z = 0. We can consider the square zero extensions of R by M in the category of\ncommutative rings. All the square zero extensions have the following form\n\n\n0 \ufffd M \ufffd X \u2295 Z\u03b3 \ufffd R \ufffd 0 (8.1)\n\n\nwhere X = [\u223c] Z\u03b1 \u2295 Z\u03b2 as an abelian group with \u03b1 being the image of the generator z, the image\nof the unit \u03b3 is the unit x and the image of \u03b2 being the generator y. Since M [2] = 0 we get that\n\u03b1 [2] = 0. Since y [2] = 0, we get that \u03b1\u03b2 = 0 and \u03b2 [2] = h\u03b1 for some integer h. We define h to be the\nHopf invariant of the extension (8.1).\n\n\nLet f : S [4][n][\u2212][1] \u2192 S [2][n] be a continuous map.

The \u03a8-operations on\n\u03a8 [k] : X \u2192 X are given by\n\u03c8 [k] (m, r) = (k [n] [\u2032] m + \u03bd k r, k [n] r),\n\n\nfor some \u03bd k \u2208 Z.\n\n\n\u03a8 [k] (\u03a8 [l] (m, r)) = (k [n] [\u2032] l [n] [\u2032] m + k [n] [\u2032] \u03bd l r + \u03bd k l [n] r, k [n] l [n] r),\n\n\n\u03a8 [l] (\u03a8 [k] (m, r)) = (l [n] [\u2032] k [n] [\u2032] m + l [n] [\u2032] \u03bd k r + \u03bd l k [n] r, l [n] k [n] r).\n\n\nSince the \u03a8-operations commute, we get that\n\n\n\u03bd l r(k [n] [\u2032] \u2212 k [n] ) = \u03bd k r(l [n] [\u2032] \u2212 l [n] ).\n\n\nIf n = n [\u2032] then there is no restriction on the choice of \u03bd p for p prime.

If there exists an extension in Ext \u03bb (K(S [2][n] ), K [\ufffd] (S [2][n] [\u2032] )) whose Hopf invariant\nis odd, then either n = n [\u2032] or min(n, n [\u2032] ) \u2264 g | [2] n\u2212n [\u2032] | [, where][ g] j [p] [denotes the multiplicity of the prime]\np in the prime factorisation of the greatest common divisor of the set of integers {(k [j] \u2212 1)| k \u2208\nN \u2212{1, qp|\u2200q \u2208 N}}.\n\n\nProof. The case when n = n [\u2032] is clear. Assume that n \u0338= n [\u2032], then the special \u03a8-ring extensions\nare given by a pair (h, \u03bd) where h is the Hopf invariant. By 8.8, h can only be odd if 2 [n] divides\nG n,n \u2032 . Assume that n < n [\u2032], since the other case is analogous.
