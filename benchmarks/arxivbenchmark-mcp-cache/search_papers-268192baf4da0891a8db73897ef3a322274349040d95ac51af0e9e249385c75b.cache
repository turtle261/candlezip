      "abstract": "Currently, there is much controversy surrounding the interpretation of the\n$\\Xi(2030)$ and $\\Xi(2012)$ as traditional hadrons containing double strange\nquarks. In particular, the ratios of the partial decay widths into\n$\\Lambda\\bar{K}$ and $\\Sigma\\bar{K}$ for $\\Xi(2030)$ cannot obtain a suitable\nexplanation under the $qss$ three quark structure~\\cite{Xiao:2013xi}. Thus, we\nsuggest the $\\Xi(2030)$ and $\\Xi(2012)$ to be\n$VB(=\\bar{K}^{*}\\Sigma/\\rho\\Xi/\\bar{K}^{*}\\Lambda/\\phi\\Xi/\\omega\\Xi)$ molecular\nstates. In this work, we perform a systematical investigation of possible\nmolecular states from the\n$VB(=\\bar{K}^{*}\\Sigma/\\rho\\Xi/\\bar{K}^{*}\\Lambda/\\phi\\Xi/\\omega\\Xi)$\ninteraction. The interaction of the system considered is described by the\n$t$-channel vector ($\\rho,\\omega,\\phi,\\bar{K}^{*}$) and pseudoscalar\n($\\pi,\\eta,\\bar{K}$) mesons exchanges. By solving the non-relativistic\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation with the obtained one-boson-exchange potentials, the\n$VB(=\\bar{K}^{*}\\Sigma/\\rho\\Xi/\\bar{K}^{*}\\Lambda/\\phi\\Xi/\\omega\\Xi)$ bound\nstates with different quantum numbers are searched. The calculation suggests\nthat $\\Xi(2030)$ can be assigned as a $P$-wave\n$\\bar{K}^{*}\\Sigma/\\rho\\Xi/\\bar{K}^{*}\\Lambda/\\phi\\Xi/\\omega\\Xi$ molecular\nstate with spin parity $J^P=5/2^{+}$. The calculation also predict the\nexistence of four\n$\\bar{K}^{*}\\Sigma/\\rho\\Xi/\\bar{K}^{*}\\Lambda/\\phi\\Xi/\\omega\\Xi$ bound states\nwith $J^P=1/2^{\\pm}$ and $J^P=3/2^{\\pm}$. The $\\Xi(2012)$ may be a candidate\nfor one of these four bound states. If $\\Xi(2012)$ is an $S$-wave molecular\nstate with $J^P=1/2^{-}$ or $J^P=3/2^{-}$, we suggest determining its spin and\nparity by studying its decay width, owing to the difference in their molecular\ncomponents.",
