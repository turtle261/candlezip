Fibonacci word fractals are a class of fractals that have been stud\nied recently, though the word they are generated from is more widely studied\nin combinatorics. The Fibonacci word can be used to draw a curve which possesses self-similarities determined by the recursive structure of the word. The\nHausdorff dimension of the scaling limit of the finite Fibonacci word curves is\ncomputed for _i_ -Fibonacci curves and any drawing angle between 0 and _\u03c0/_ 2.\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\nMotivated by the work of Monnerot-Dumaine [7], we analyze a generalized class\nof Fibonacci fractals for their Hausdorff dimension. The two parameters we consider\nare the drawing angle as introduced by Monnerot-Dumaine and the use of the\n_i\u2212_ Fibonacci words as introduced by Ram\u00b4\u0131rez et al [10, 11, 12]. The necessity\nof this analysis is that the dimensions estimated in the previous works are for\nthe self-similarity dimension despite occasional references to Hausdorff dimension.\nThe equality of these two dimensions often holds but is not automatic. Equality\nholds in the familiar case when there exists an iterated function system satisfying\nthe open set condition whose attractor is the fractal in question. Many of the\nalready mentioned papers and those of Blondin-Mass\u00b4e [2] also include a study of\nthe Fibonacci snowflake fractal which we do not consider in the present paper.\nThe basic construction of the Fibonacci fractals is based on three operations: one\nis a recursive construction of a string of symbols, the second is the processing of a\nfinite string into a curve, and the third is taking a scaling limit of the finite curves\nto a fractal limit. The construction of the recursively defined words is what gives\nthe name Fibonacci to these fractals. Fibonacci words, as strings of 0 _[\u2032]_ _s_ and 1 _[\u2032]_ _s_\nhave been extensively studied since at least the 1980\u2019s. See for a few examples [1, 3].\nThe processing of the finite words into curves is inspired, though not identical, to\na similar process in _L\u2212_ systems [7].\nMuch of the notation will look similar, but mean very different things. Any\ngiven finite Fibonacci word is written with notation _f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [. More on what] _[ i]_ [ and] _[ n]_\nrepresent later. A finite Fibonacci curve is denoted as _F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [. A Fibonacci number]\nitself is shown as _F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [. It should be noted the difference in the case of the letter]\nand the font in determining the meaning of a symbol. Additionally we denote the\nfractal associated to an _i\u2212_ Fibonacci word with drawing angle _\u03b1_ as _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [.]\nWe begin by first stating the definitions of the Fibonacci and i-Fibonacci words\nalong with some of their particularly useful properties (Section 2). We then draw\nthe corresponding curves and explore their properties as well (Section 3). Finally\n\n\n_Date_ : September 24, 2018.\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 TYLER HOFFMAN AND BENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\n\nTable 1\n\n|n|[2]<br>f<br>n|[3]<br>f<br>n|\n|---|---|---|\n|1|0|0|\n|2|01|001|\n|3|010|0010|\n|4|01001|0010001|\n|5|01001010|00100010010|\n\n\n\nwe demonstrate the existence of the fractals and most importantly calculate the\nHausdorff dimension of any given i-Fibonacci fractal with drawing angle 0 _\u2264_ _\u03b1 \u2264_ _[\u03c0]_ 2\n\n(Section 5). The final theorem of the paper will be the continuity of the fractal\nconstruction as a function of the drawing angle, Proposition 12 and Theorem 6.\n\n\n**Acknowledgements.** We thank Zachary Littrell for his aid in reviewing our code\nand Spencer Hamblen for his reoccurring timely assistance.

Fibonacci Words\n\n\nThe (classical) _n_ _[\u2032]_ _th_ Fibonacci word is the word _f_ _n_ defined over the alphabet\n_{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ that is generated by the concatenation rule _f_ _n_ = _f_ _n\u2212_ 1 _f_ _n\u2212_ 2 with initial values\n_f_ 0 = 1 and _f_ 1 = 0. Later we will discuss the infinite word _f_ . More information\non the sequence can be found in the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences\nfor sequence number A003849 [6]. Since the first _F_ _n_ digits of _f_ _m_ _m > n_ are fixed\nit is possible to define _f_ _\u221e_ as the infinite Fibonacci word. We however show the\nexistence of _f_ _\u221e_ metrically in Proposition 3.\nThe _i\u2212_ Fibonacci word is constructed according the the same rules as a classical\nFibonacci word however the initial values are _f_ 1 = 0 and _f_ 2 = 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1. We use 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1]\n\nto represent a string of 0\u2019s of length _i \u2212_ 1. Table 1 lists the first five _i\u2212_ Fibonacci\nwords for _n_ = 2, the standard Fibonacci words, and _n_ = 3 _._\nWhile concatenation is the basic construction technique for Fibonacci words\nwe will define a substitution rule that will produce _f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] from _f_ 1 [[] _[i]_ []] as well. The\nmain utility is that the application of a substitution rule is a local operation while\nconcatenation is global operation. This perspective will be more useful in the\ndiscussion of the curves in the next section. It should be noted that while our \u039e [[] _[i]_ []]\n\nsubstitution is similar to the _\u03c3_ substitution used in [7], it is not the same.\n\n\n**Definition 1.** _Define_ \u039e [[] _[i]_ []] _to be the substitution rule:_\n\n\n0 _\u2192_ 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1\n\u039e [[] _[i]_ []] :\n0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1 _\u2192_ 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 10\n\ufffd\n\n\n_over words comprised of blocks of the form_ 0 _and_ 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1 _._\n\n\nSince \u039e [[] _[i]_ []] transforms a sequence of blocks 0 and 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1 into another sequence of\nblocks of 0 and 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1 the transformation can be iterated.\n\n\n**Proposition 1.** _Let f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[be an][ i][\u2212][Fibonacci word then]_ [ \u039e] [[] _[i]_ []] [(] _[f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ []] [) =] _[ f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ +1 []] _[.]_\n\n\nHAUSDORFF DIMENSION OF FIBONACCI FRACTALS 3\n\n\nSince _f_ 1 [[] _[i]_ []] [is unambiguous in how it is written as a single block of 0 we will always]\nassume that _f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [is broken down into these blocks in the way that it arises as the]\noutput of this process.\n\n\n_Proof._ We proceed by induction. Note that _f_ 1 [[] _[i]_ []] = 0 and \u039e [[] _[i]_ []] (0) = 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1 = _f_ 2 [[] _[i]_ []] [.]\nSimilarly that \u039e [[] _[i]_ []] ( _f_ 1 [[] _[i]_ []] [) =] _[ f]_ 2 [ [] _[i]_ []] can be checked manually. Suppose the proposition\nholds for _n \u2212_ 1 and _n \u2212_ 2 and we will show it holds for _n_ . Since \u039e [[] _[i]_ []] acts locally by\nreplacing blocks and _f_ _n_ = _f_ _n\u2212_ 1 _f_ _n\u2212_ 2 can be split into two sub-collections of blocks\nthe action of \u039e [[] _[i]_ []] can be split over _f_ _n\u2212_ 1 and _f_ _n\u2212_ 2 so that\n\n\u039e [[] _[i]_ []] ( _f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [) = \u039e] [[] _[i]_ []] [(] _[f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 1 _[f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 2 [) = \u039e] [[] _[i]_ []] [(] _[f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 1 [)\u039e] [[] _[i]_ []] [(] _[f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 2 [) =] _[ f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ []] _[f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 1 [=] _[ f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ +1 []] _[.]_\n\n\n                       \n\nThe following properties of the _i\u2212_ Fibonacci words will be useful later. They are\ncited here without proof.\n\n\n**Proposition 2.** [12, Proposition 5] _The following properties hold for all i-Fibonacci_\n_words f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[.]_\n(1) _The subword \u201d11\u201d can never be found in an i-Fibonacci word with i \u2265_ 2 _._\n(2) _The word f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[can be decomposed as][ p]_ _n_ _[ab][ where][ p]_ _n_ _[is a palindrome and][ ab]_\n_depend on the parity of n only._\n(3) _For even n, ab_ = 10 _and for odd n, ab_ = 01\n(4) _The i-Fibonacci word has a five-partite structure_\n\n_f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [=] _[ f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 _[f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 _[f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 6 _[l]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 _[l]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 _[,]_\n\n\n_where l_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [=] _[ p]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[ba][ (i.e. the last two letters are swapped).]_\n\n\n**Proposition 3.** _The infinite i-Fibonacci words exist for any given i \u2265_ 2 _and are_\n_f_ [[] _[i]_ []] = lim _n\u2192\u221e_ _f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[.]_\n\n\n_Proof._ The limit is taken in the sense of the standard 2 _\u2212_ adic metric on the space\nof finite and infinite words. That is _d_ 2 ( _w, v_ ) = 2 _[\u2212][n]_ where _n_ is the number of initial\nsymbols that _w_ and _v_ share. By the definition of _f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [as concatenations, for each] _[ i]_\nthe sequence is Cauchy in this metric. Thus there is a limit word that is denoted\n_f_ [[] _[i]_ []] \n\nIt was mentioned earlier that the infinite Fibonacci words could also be considered as fixed points of the concatenation rule. This metric proof of the existence\nis equivalent to that argument by the definition of the metric measuring distance\nbetween two words by measuring the length of the longest shared prefix of those\ntwo words.\n\n\n3. Fibonacci Curves\n\n\nThe Fibonacci word curve _F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] is generated by taking the corresponding Fibonacci word _f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [and applying the following drawing rule. The Fibonacci curves]\nintroduced in [7] are just the case when _i_ = 2.\n**Drawing Rule:** Let _a_ _j_ be the _j_ \u2019th character of _f_ _n_ and perform the following\nprocedure over each character _a_ _j_ .\n\n(1) Set initial direction, _a_ ( _\u2205_ ) = _[\u03c0]_ 2\n\n(2) Choose drawing angle _\u03b1_ .\n\n\n4 TYLER HOFFMAN AND BENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\n\n(3) Draw a segment in the current direction.\n(4) If _a_ _j_ is 0 then\n\n_\u2022_ If _j_ is even, turn left, i.e. add _\u03b1_ to the current direction.\n\n_\u2022_ If _j_ is odd, turn right, i.e. subtract _\u03b1_ from the current direction.\n(5) If _a_ _j_ is 1, do not change direction.\n(6) Repeat from step 3 to step 5 for _j_ = 1 to _j_ = _F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[.]_\n\nIt should be noted that the instructions \u201cturn right\u201d or \u201cturn left\u201d mean to\nchange the angle at which the next segment will be drawn. When the end of a\nword is reached by the drawing rule, there will be an angle pointing to where the\nnext segment would be drawn and this final direction will be called the net angle\nof a word.\n\n\n**Definition 2.** _Let a_ ( _w_ ) _be a function on finite words on the alphabet {_ 0 _,_ 1 _}. Set_\n_a_ ( _\u2205_ ) = _\u03c0/_ 2 _, this value is the \u201cinitial angle.\u201d Then a_ ( _wb_ ) = _a_ ( _w_ ) + _\u03c8 where_\n\n\n_\u2022 \u03c8_ = 0 _if b_ = 1 _,_\n\n_\u2022 \u03c8_ = 1 _if b_ = 0 _and |wb| is even,_\n\n_\u2022 \u03c8_ = 1 _if b_ = 0 _and |wb| is odd._\n\n\nFollowing from the properties of the i-Fibonacci words are the corresponding\nproperties for the curves.\n\n\n**Proposition 4.** [12, Proposition 6] _The following properties hold for all curves_\n_F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[.]_\n\n\n(1) _There exist only segments of length 1 or 2 in the curve._\n(2) _The curve F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[is similar to the curve][ F]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 _[with the same shape, but dif-]_\n_ferent number of segments._\n(3) _The scaling factor between curves F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[and][ F]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 _[is]_ [ 1 +] _\u221a_ 2 _._\n\n(4) _Similar to the above word property, the curve F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[has a five-partite structure]_\n_written_\n_F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [=] _[ F]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 _[F]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 _[F]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 6 _[F]_ _[\u2032]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 _[F]_ _[\u2032]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3\n\n_where F_ _[\u2032]_ [[] _n_ _[i]_ []] _[is the curve corresponding to the word][ l]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[.]_\n\n\nIt is assumed that the lengths of the line segments is \u201cunit length.\u201d In Section\n5 scaling ratios between _F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [and] _[ F]_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ _\u2212_ []] 3 [will be determined. They will depend on]\n_i_, _n_, and also _\u03b1_ . The scaling ratios will then allow us to take a scaling limit to\nobtain a Fibonacci fractal. For the time being though, the specific length of the\nline segments is left unspecified.\nNext we want a function that determines what the end behavior of any given\nsubword is in terms of its angle.\n\n\n**Proposition 5.** _Let w be a word composed of the blocks_ 0 _and_ 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1 _. Then a_ ( _w_ ) =\n_\u2212a_ (\u039e [[] _[i]_ []] _[\u25e6]_ [3] ( _w_ )) _. Furthermore, a_ ( _w_ ) = _a_ (\u039e [[] _[i]_ []] _[\u25e6]_ [6] ( _w_ )) _._\n\n\n_Proof._ Consider the third substitution on each of two basic blocks:\n\n(\u039e [[] _[i]_ []] ) [3] (0) = 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 100 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1\n\n(\u039e [[] _[i]_ []] ) [3] (0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1) = 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 100 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 10 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 10 _._\n\n\nThus we can see by processing the words according to the drawing rule that\n_a_ (\u039e [[] _[i]_ []] _[\u25e6]_ [3] (0) = _\u2212a_ (0). Similarly _a_ (\u039e [[] _[i]_ []] _[\u25e6]_ [3] (0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1)) = _\u2212a_ (0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1). By the additivity of\n\n\nHAUSDORFF DIMENSION OF FIBONACCI FRACTALS 5\n\n\nFigure 1. An example of a bounding box for _F_ 11 [[2]] [,] _[ \u03b1]_ [ =] _[\u03c0]_ 2 [. Notice]\n\nthat the initial line segment begins at vertex A and that the last\nline segment is at vertex D.\n\n\nthe angle function over concatenation of words when \u039e [[] _[i]_ []] is applied another three\ntimes to the sign of the overall angle is again negated. Thus _a_ (\u039e [[] _[i]_ []] _[\u25e6]_ [6] (0)) = _a_ (0)\nand the same for 0 _[i][\u2212]_ [1] 1 as well. \n\nFrom Table 3 it is clear that as _n_ increases the curve _F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [pass through several]\nglobal shapes. It is clear that their local structure is similar but for the global\nstructure to be the same and for the orientation of the curve to be the same again\nit is necessary to consider only when _n_ mod 6 = _k_ . Notice that Proposition 5\ngives another reason for considering every sixth curve as well. For purely historical\nreasons from [7] we consider _k_ = 5 for even _i_ . For odd _i_ we consider _k_ = 3 as it is\nvisually the most similar. Equivalent analyses could be conducted for any choice\nof _k_ . The following proposition is the first that makes reference to this choice.\n\n**Proposition 6.** _When i is even a_ \ufffd _f_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 \ufffd = _\u2212\u03b1 and when i is odd a_ \ufffd _f_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +3 \ufffd = 0 _._\n\n_Proof._ By Proposition 5 _a_ ( _f_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [) =] _[ a]_ [(] _[f]_ _n_ [ [] _[i]_ +6 []] [). So] _[ a]_ \ufffd _f_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 \ufffd = _a_ ( _f_ 5 [[] _[i]_ []] [) =] _[ \u2212][\u03b1]_ [ for even] _[ i]_\n\nand _a_ \ufffd _f_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +3 \ufffd = _a_ ( _f_ 3 [[] _[i]_ []] [) = 0 for odd] _[ i]_ [.] \n\nFinally, we verify that there exists no overlap between any two blocks of the\nfive-partite structure for a later proof of Proposition 10.\n\n\n**Definition 3.** _The bounding box of a given curve F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _is the smallest rectangle_\n_enclosing the curve._\n\n\n**Example 1.** Refer to Figure 1 depicting _F_ 11 [[2]] [where the dotted red rectangle is the]\nbounding box formed by vertices A, B, C, and D.\n\n\n**Proposition 7.** _Consider for even i F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 _[and for odd][ i][ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +3 _[. Then the first and]_\n_last vertices of these curves are co-located with two adjacent vertices of the bounding_\n_box._\n\n\n6 TYLER HOFFMAN AND BENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\n\nFigure 2. The mappings _\u03c6_ _k_ when _\u03b1_ = _[\u03c0]_ 2 [from the IFS over the]\n\nset _V_, the box they are contained in.\n\n\n_Proof._ Consider the even _i_ case. Curves of the form _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [have first and last]\nvertices on a line in R [2] and we wish to show that no other segments cross this line.\nIt is true for _F_ 5 [[] _[i]_ []] because for any even _i_ it consists of a diagonal walk up, a double\nsegment, and a diagonal walk down of equal length providing a net right turn. This\ngives that the net change in the vertical coordinate is zero. Notice that, with this\ndescription of _F_ 5 [[] _[i]_ []] [, it is entirely contained inside of its bounding box. It is true]\nfor _F_ 8 [[] _[i]_ []] because it is the assemblage of four copies of _F_ 5 [[] _[i]_ []] and an _F_ 2 [[] _[i]_ []] in the shape\nshown in Figure 2.\nRecall that each curve _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [is made up of curves] _[ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +2 [and] _[ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] _\u2212_ 1 [(from the]\n\nfive-partite structure). Assuming that the claim is true for _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +2 [and] _[ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] _\u2212_ 1 [, then it]\nholds for their assemblage because of their arrangement in the five-partite structure.\nFinally, since the case for odd _i_ introduces only a rotation of _[\u03c0]_ 4 [and rotation does]\n\nnot change these properties, it holds for this case as well. \n\n**Proposition 8.** _The bounding boxes of each individual sub-curve of F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[from the]_\n_five-partite structure have disjoint interiors._\n\n\n_Proof._ From the five-partite structure, we know that the last vertex of one subcurve is the first vertex of the next sub-curve since the sub-curves are connected\nand form a continuous path. From Proposition 7, we know that the first and last\nvertices of a sub-curve are also vertices of the bounding box. This means that the\nbounding boxes of the two sub-curves that share a vertex also share that same\nvertex. Due to the fact that we draw with an _\u03b1 \u2264_ _[\u03c0]_ 2 [angle and that this vertex is]\n\nspecifically the first or last vertex, no segment from one bounding box, that is one\nsub-curve, will ever intersect with the interior of the adjacent sub-curve\u2019s bounding\nbox.\n\nIt remains to be shown that non-adjacent sub-curves also have bounding boxes\nwith disjoint interiors. Specifically, we need to show that that the bounding boxes\nfor the first and last sub-curves do not intersect. Because of the five-partite structure, we know that the first and last boxes are the same as the second and fourth\n\n\nHAUSDORFF DIMENSION OF FIBONACCI FRACTALS 7\n\n|Col1|n = 15|n = 16|n = 17|n = 18|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|_i_ = 2|||||\n|_i_ = 3|||||\n|_i_ = 4|||||\n|_i_ = 5|||||\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

We follow [7] and choose for _i_ even _n_ = 6 _k_ + 5 as the approximating curves\nto a fractal. For _i_ odd we choose _n_ = 6 _k_ + 3 because it is only varies from the first\nchoice by a rotation.\n\n\n4. Fractal Geometry\n\n\nIn this section we state the definitions and constructions necessary for the computation of the Hausdorff dimension of a fractal given by an iterated function system\n(IFS) satisfying the open set condition.

But for a particular class of self-similar fractals its computation can\noften be done via a simpler route.\nAn Iterated Function System (IFS) is an indexed collection of mappings _{\u03c6_ _i_ _}_ _i\u2208I_\nwhich in this case are from R [2] onto itself. We also make the assumption that the\nmappings are contracting similarities. An IFS defines a set function by\n\nR [2] _\u2283_ _K \ufffd\u2192_ \ufffd _\u03c6_ _i_ ( _K_ ) = \u03a6( _K_ ) _._\n\n\n_i\u2208I_\n\n\nA set is called self-similar if _K_ = \u03a6( _K_ ).

Fibonacci Fractals\n\n\nIn this section we are concerned with showing the existence and Hausdorff dimension of the Fibonacci fractals. The fractal itself is a scaling limit of the curves\n_F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] [along the subsequence] _[ n]_ [ = 6] _[k]_ [ + 5 for even] _[ i]_ [ and] _[ n]_ [ = 6] _[k]_ [ + 3 for odd] _[ i]_ [. But to]\ncreate a self-similar description of the fractal similar to the self-similar/five-partite\nproperty of the Fibonacci words we have to include _n_ = 6 _k_ + 2 and _n_ = 6 _k_ curves\nas well. Let the _i_ -Fibonacci curves be drawn with line segments of length one.\n\n\n**Definition 7.** _Consider the distance between the initial and final point of a Fi-_\n_bonacci curve. The ratio of this length between k and k_ + 1 _is the scaling ratio._\n\n\n**Theorem 3.** For drawing angle _\u03b1_, the scaling ratio of the curve is\n\n\n\n_R_ = \ufffd(1 + cos( _\u03b1_ )) + \ufffd\n\n\n\n_\u2212_ 1\n(1 + cos( _\u03b1_ )) [2] + 1 _._\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n_Proof._ Consider the trapezoid in Figure 5 describing the proportions of the curve\nand label the wider base of the trapezoid to have length _c_ . Similarly, label the\nwidth of each of the _n \u2212_ 3 sub-curves to have length 1, and finally the sub-curve\n_n_ _\u2212_ 6 to have length [1] _c_ [. Here,] _[ c]_ [ is the scaling ratio from a previous curve to a larger]\n\ncurve. By the properties of trapezoids, the width of the larger base, _c_, can also be\nwritten as\n_c_ = 2 + [1]\n\n_c_ [+ 2] _[cos]_ [(] _[\u03b1]_ [)]\n\n\n10 TYLER HOFFMAN AND BENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\n\nFigure 5. For _\u03b1 \u223c_ _\u03c0/_ 3 a representative curve is drawn and the\nrelationship between the widths of the five pieces of the fractal are\ndetermined to fix a scaling ratio.\n\n\nMultiply through by _c_ to obtain a quadratic and solve via the quadratic formula:\n\n\n_c_ [2] _\u2212_ 2(1 + _cos_ ( _\u03b1_ )) _c \u2212_ 1 = 0\n\n\n~~\ufffd~~ 4(1 + cos( _\u03b1_ )) [2] + 4\n_c_ = [2][(][1 + cos][(] _[\u03b1]_ [))][ +]\n\n2\nand because we are concerned with the scaling ratio from a larger curve to a smaller\ncurve, we raise _c_ to the _\u2212_ 1 and simplify to get our scaling ratio. \n\n**Definition 8.** _Let w_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[be the Euclidean distance between the starting and ending]_\n_vertices of F_ _n_ [[] _[i]_ []] _[and][ h]_ _n_ _[the height of the curve in the direction perpendicular to the]_\n_line connecting the first and last vertices of the curve. Notice that both w and h_\n_depend on the drawing angle, n, and i. The aspect ratio is defined as_ _[w]_ _h_ _[.]_\n\n\nLet _j_ = 3 _k_ +2 or 3 _k_ depending as _i_ is even or odd respectively. The scaling limit\nis achieved by taking the length of the individual line segments to be _w_ _[\u2212]_ [1], thus\nthe width of the scaled curves is always 1. Theorem 4 proves that the scaling limit\nexists as a limit in the Hausdorff metric space. The following proposition about the\naspect ratio as _k_ increases will be a central piece to the proof of Theorems 4 and 6.\n\n\n**Proposition 9.**\n\n\n\n\n[+] _[ \u2212]_ [1] 1 _\u2212_ _R_\n\nsin( _\u03b1_ ) [=] _R_ sin( _\u03b1_ ) _[.]_\n\n\n\nlim\n_k\u2192\u221e_\n\n\n\n_w_ [[] _[i]_ []]\n_j_ ( _k_ ) [(] _[\u03b1]_ [)]\n\n\n\n_w_ _j_ ( _k_ ) _[\u03b1]_ = _[r]_ [+] _[ \u2212]_ [1]\n\n_h_ [[] _[i]_ []] sin( _\u03b1_ )\n_j_ ( _k_ ) [(] _[\u03b1]_ [)]\n\n\n\n_Proof._ Consider the two relations between the \u201cheight\u201d and \u201cwidth\u201d of the _F_ _j_ [[] _[i]_ ( []] _k_ ) [:]\n\n\n(2) _w_ _k_ = 2 _w_ _k\u2212_ 1 + _w_ _k\u2212_ 2 + 2 cos( _\u03b1_ ) _w_ _k\u2212_ 1\n\n\n(3) _h_ _k_ = _h_ _k\u2212_ 1 + sin( _\u03b1_ ) _w_ _k\u2212_ 1 _._\n\n\nBy using the width formula repeatedly in the height formula we can arrive at a\nmore useful formula for the height.

The first is the existence of a scaling limit of the\nFibonacci curves for a given _i_ and (sub)-sequence of _n_ . The second is if it is possible\nto represent this limit curve as a self-similar set with a particular IFS. Doing so\nwill enable the standard argument for computing Hausdorff dimension by way of\ncomputing the self-similarity (fractal) dimension.\n\n\n**Theorem 4.** For drawing angle _\u03b1 \u2208_ (0 _, \u03c0/_ 2] there exists a scaling limit along a\nsubsequence of the Fibonacci curves. For even _i_, the scaling limit of _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [exists,]\n\n\n\nfor odd _i_ the scaling limit of _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +3 [exists. The scaling factors are] _\u221a_\n\n\n\nfor odd _i_ the scaling limit of _F_ 6 _k_ +3 [exists. The scaling factors are] _\u221a_ 2 _/w_ 6 _k_ +5 and\n\n_\u221a_ 2 _/w_ 6 _k_ +3 respectively for the parity of _i_ .\n\n\n\n2 _/w_ 6 _k_ +3 respectively for the parity of _i_ .\n\n\n\nThe choice of scaling _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [to have width] _\u221a_\n\n\n\nThe choice of scaling _F_ 6 _k_ +5 [to have width] _\u221a_ 2 is to maintain consistency with\n\nthe scaling used in [7]. Any other value would of course make no difference in the\nfollowing proof, however the aspect ratio would still limit to _\u221a_ 2.\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\n\n_Proof._ Consider the case when _i_ is even. The odd case is similar. We compute the\nHausdorff distance between scaled copies of _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [and] _[ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +11 [to show that the]\n\nsequence is Cauchy and thus has a limit, _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [. First] _[ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +11 [is composed of 4 copies]\n\n\n\nof _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [and a single copy of] _[ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] _\u2212_ 1 [, scaled so that] _[ w]_ [6] _[k]_ [+11] [ =] _\u221a_\n\n\n\n2 so\n\n\n\n_h_ 6 _k_ +11 =\n\n\n\n_\u221a_ 2\n\n( _h_ 6 _k_ +5 + sin( _\u03b1_ ) _w_ 6 _k_ +5 )\n_w_ 6 _k_ +11\n\n\n\nwhich for large enough _k_ is within any given _\u03f5 >_ 0 of 1 by Proposition 9.\nThus each of the five parts of _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +11 [has a bounding box with a Hausdorff]\n\ndistance of _\u03f5_ of the corresponding bounding box of _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [. This is because with the]\nwidths fixed to the appropriate length the bounding boxes at each level share at\nleast one common vertex and orientation with only their heights varying.\nNow consider the portions of the curves within one of those five bounding boxes.\nConsider the first and last vertex of _F_ 5 [[] _[i]_ []] [. As] _[ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [are recursively constructed and]\n\n\n\nscaled the images of the two points has a mesh size that is no more than _\u221a_\n\n\n\n3 _\u2212k_\n2\n\n\n12 TYLER HOFFMAN AND BENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\n\nFigure 6. Bounding trapezoids for _\u03b1 \u0338_ = _\u03c0/_ 2.\n\n\nwhich goes to zero as _k_ grows. Since the difference between _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [and] _[ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +11\nbetween two adjacent images of the first and last points is that while _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [has an]\n\n_F_ 5 [[] _[i]_ []] connecting them _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +11 [has a] _[ F]_ 11 [[] _[i]_ []] [. That is a bounded number of extra edges]\n\n3 _\u2212k_\n\nand so the distance traveled by the excursion is a bounded multiple of _\u221a_ 2 . For\n\n_k_ large enough this will be less than _\u03f5_ . Thus the Hausdorff distance between the\nscaled copies of _F_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +5 [and] _[ F]_ 6 [[] _[i]_ _k_ []] +11 [is less than any given] _[ \u03f5]_ [ for] _[ k]_ [ large enough. Since]\nthe Hausdorff metric space is complete there exists a scaling limit set. \n\nFor _i_ even let the IFS be the five contractive similarities that map the large\ntrapezoid onto the five similar trapezoids in Figures 2 and 6 such that the image\nof the _x\u2212_ axis falls onto the dark line. For odd _i_, use the same five maps composed\nwith a clockwise rotation of _\u03c0/_ 4. The maps are referred to as _\u03c6_ _i_, _i_ = 1 _,_ 2 _,_ 3 _,_ 4 _,_ 5.\nThe following lemma follows directly from this definition of the IFSs by choosing\n_V_ to be the interior of the largest trapezoid in Figure 6. In Proposition 8 it was\nshown that the Fibonacci curves themselves satisfy the open set condition so that\nit is expected that an IFS we choose should as well.\n\n\n**Proposition 10.** _For both parities of i, the IFSs described both satisfy the open_\n_set condition._\n\n\n**Proposition 11.** _There exists a unique attractor for both of the above IFS for_\n_\u03b1 \u2208_ (0 _, \u03c0/_ 2] _._\n\n\n_Proof._ Notice that all five of the _\u03c6_ have contraction ratio either _R_ _[\u2212]_ [1] or _R_ _[\u2212]_ [2] (see\nTheorem 3) both of which are less than one for all _\u03b1 \u2208_ (0 _, \u03c0/_ 2]. So by Theorem 1\nthere is a unique attractor. \n\nThere is no a priori guarantee that _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [is equal to the attractor of the appropriate]\nIFS. However it is.\n\n\n**Theorem 5.** The attractor of the IFS corresponding to the parity of _i_ and value\nof _\u03b1 \u2208_ (0 _, \u03c0/_ 2] is the equal to _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [.]\n\n\n_Proof._ Fix an _i_ and _\u03b1_ . Let _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [be the scaling limit and apply the IFS to it, i.e.]\nconsider [\ufffd] [5] _i_ =1 _[\u03c6]_ _[i]_ [(] _[F]_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [).] Because the scaling limit is already invariant under the\nscaling process, replacing the curve with five scaled copies of the curve so that the\nwidth remains _\u221a_ 2 we can use Theorem 3 to say that the scaled copies are scaled\n\nby exactly _R_ and _R_ [2] . Again since the scaling limit is as we said invariant under\nthe scaling operation we note that Proposition 9 that the aspect ratio remains\nunchanged. Thus the scaling operation acts on _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [as an IFS with the five maps,]\nthe same scaling ratios, and general \u201cU-shaped\u201d pattern as the IFS defined above.\n\n\nHAUSDORFF DIMENSION OF FIBONACCI FRACTALS 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. The Hausdorff dimension of _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] as a function of _\u03b1_ .\nThe dimension is actually independent of _i_ whose parity only determines the exact embedding of _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [in][ R] [2] [. Notice that the limit]\nas _\u03b1 \u2192_ 0 is 1.\n\n\nTo show that they are the same IFS we refer back to Propositions 5 and 6 which\ntogether imply that since _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [has initial point at the origin that the five sub-curves]\nare in exactly the same alignment as shown in Figure 6. The previous paragraph\nshows they are the same size as well. Thus _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [is invariant under the IFS, so by]\nthe uniqueness of the attractor _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [is the attractor.] \n\nIt should be noted what happens when _\u03b1_ = 0. In this case the apsect ratio is 0\nand the scaling limit becomes a line segment in the direction _\u03b1_ of length _\u221a_ 2. The\n\nfractal degenerates to a line.\nWith these results, we now know enough to properly calculate the Hausdorff\ndimension of the attractor of our IFS which in turn is the same dimension as that\nof the curve _F_ [[] _[i]_ []] .\n\n\n5.2. **Dimension.** We are now in a position to state the first significant result of\nthe paper, the Hausdorff dimension as a function of drawing angle. It is noteworthy\nthat the dimension, in fact the fractals themselves do not depend on _i_ in any way.\nThus the value of _i_ is only of combinatorial interest.\n\n\n**Proposition 12.** _For drawing angle \u03b1 \u2208_ [0 _, \u03c0/_ 2] _the Hausdorff dimension of the_\n_fractal is given by_\n\n_\u221a_ 5)\n_s_ = [ln][(] _[\u2212]_ [2 +]\n\nln( _R_ )\n\n\n_Proof._ Fix _i_ and _\u03b1_ .

The\ncontinuity of the fractals as _\u03b1_ grows above _\u03c0/_ 2 is conjectured but in that case the\nIFS has many overlaps that the continuity of the dimension function is not obvious.\n\n\n**Theorem 6.** The function that maps _\u03b1 \u2208_ [0 _, \u03c0/_ 2] to the fractal _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [for any] _[ i][ \u2265]_ [2]\nis continuous from above at _\u03b1_ = 0 as a map from the interval into the Hausdorff\nmetric space.\n\n\n\n_Proof._ Consider the points (0 _,_ 0) and ( _\u221a_\n\n\n\n2 sin( _\u03b1_ ) _,_ _\u221a_\n\n\n\n_Proof._ Consider the points (0 _,_ 0) and ( _\u221a_ 2 sin( _\u03b1_ ) _,_ _\u221a_ 2 cos( _\u03b1_ )), denote them by the\n\nset _V_ 0 _[\u03b1]_ [.] These are the first and last points mentions in the proof of Theorem\n4. By Theorem 5 _F_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [can be represented by the IFS instead of the scaling limit]\nconstruction. Let _V_ _k_ _[\u03b1]_ [be the image of] _[ V]_ _[ \u03b1]_ 0 [under] _[ k]_ [ many applications of the iterated]\nfunction system. As _k_ goes to infinity the distance between _V_ _k_ _[\u03b1]_ [and] _[ F]_ _\u03b1_ [[] _[i]_ []] [goes to]\nzero. It thus suffices to show continuity in the Hausdorff metric of _V_ _k_ _[\u03b1]_ [as a function]\nof _\u03b1_ for all _k_ .\nConsider the set _V_ 0 _[\u03b1]_ [.] As a non-empty compact subset of R [2] it is clearly a\nHausdorff-metric continuous function of _\u03b1_ . Since self-similar IFSs are Hausdorffmetric continuous functions themselves we have that _V_ _k_ _[\u03b1]_ [depends on] _[ \u03b1]_ [ continuously]\nas it is a composition of continuous maps. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] Jean Berstel, _Fibonacci words, a survey_, The Book of L (J.
