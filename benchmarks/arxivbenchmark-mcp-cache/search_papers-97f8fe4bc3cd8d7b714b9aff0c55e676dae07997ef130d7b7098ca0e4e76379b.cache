      "abstract": "We perform magnetically-assisted Sisyphus laser cooling of the triatomic free\nradical strontium monohydroxide (SrOH). This is achieved with principal optical\ncycling in the rotationally closed $P\\left(N\"=1\\right)$ branch of either the\n$\\tilde{X}^{2}\\Sigma^{+}\\left(000\\right)\\leftrightarrow\\tilde{A}^{2}\\Pi_{1/2}\\left(000\\right)$\nor the\n$\\tilde{X}^{2}\\Sigma^{+}\\left(000\\right)\\leftrightarrow\\tilde{B}^{2}\\Sigma^{+}\\left(000\\right)$\nvibronic transitions. Molecules lost into the excited vibrational states during\nthe cooling process are repumped back through the $\\tilde{B}\\left(000\\right)$\nstate for both the $\\left(100\\right)$ level of the Sr-O stretching mode and the\n$\\left(02^{0}0\\right)$ level of the bending mode. The transverse temperature of\na SrOH molecular beam is reduced in one dimension by two orders of magnitude to\n$\\sim700\\ {\\rm \\mu K}$. This approach opens a path towards creating a variety\nof ultracold polyatomic molecules, including much larger ones, by means of\ndirect laser cooling.",

      "abstract": "Pattern-avoiding ascent sequences have recently been related to set-partition\nproblems and stack-sorting problems. While the generating functions for several\nlength-3 pattern-avoiding ascent sequences are known, those avoiding 000, 100,\n110, 120 are not known. We have generated extensive series expansions for these\nfour cases, and analysed them in order to conjecture the asymptotic behaviour.\n  We provide polynomial time algorithms for the 000 and 110 cases, and\nexponential time algorithms for the 100 and 120 cases. We also describe how the\n000 polynomial time algorithm was detected somewhat mechanically given an\nexponential time algorithm.\n  For 120-avoiding ascent sequences we find that the generating function has\nstretched-exponential behaviour and prove that the growth constant is the same\nas that for 201-avoiding ascent sequences, which is known.\n  The other three generating functions have zero radius of convergence, which\nwe also prove. For 000-avoiding ascent sequences we give what we believe to be\nthe exact growth constant. We give the conjectured asymptotic behaviour for all\nfour cases.",

      "abstract": "From the Schmidt representation we have that, up to local gates, every\n2-qubit state can be written as $[\\phi\\rangle=\\lambda_1 [00\\rangle+\\lambda_2\n[11\\rangle$ with $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ real numbers. For 3-qubits states,\nit is known, PRL 2000 85, that up to local gates every 3-qubit state can be\nwritten as $[\\phi\\rangle=\\lambda_1 [000\\rangle+\\lambda_2 e^{i \\theta\n}[100\\rangle+\\lambda_3[101\\rangle+\\lambda_4[110\\rangle+\\lambda_5[111\\rangle$\nwith $\\lambda_i\\ge0$ and $0\\le \\theta \\le \\pi$. In this paper, we show that no\nevery 3-qubit state with real amplitudes can be transform in the form\n$[\\phi\\rangle=\\lambda_1 [000\\rangle+\\lambda_2\n[100\\rangle+\\lambda_3[101\\rangle+\\lambda_4[110\\rangle+\\lambda_5[111\\rangle$ by\nusing local gates in the orthogonal group (the group generated by $R_y(\\theta)$\nand $X$ gates). We also show that, up to local gates in the orthogonal group,\nevery 3-qubit with real amplitudes can be written as $[\\phi\\rangle=\\lambda_1\n[000\\rangle+\\lambda_2\n[011\\rangle+\\lambda_3[101\\rangle+\\lambda_4[110\\rangle+\\lambda_5[111\\rangle$\nwith the $\\lambda_i$ real numbers.

      "abstract": "We report on the results of a direct N-body simulation of a star cluster that\nstarted with N = 200 000, comprising 195 000 single stars and 5 000 primordial\nbinaries. The code used for the simulation includes stellar evolution, binary\nevolution, an external tidal field and the effects of two-body relaxation. The\nmodel cluster is evolved to 12 Gyr, losing more than 80% of its stars in the\nprocess. It reaches the end of the main core-collapse phase at 10.5 Gyr and\nexperiences core oscillations from that point onwards -- direct numerical\nconfirmation of this phenomenon. However, we find that after a further 1 Gyr\nthe core oscillations are halted by the ejection of a massive binary comprised\nof two black holes from the core, producing a core that shows no signature of\nthe prior core-collapse. We also show that the results of previous studies with\nN ranging from 500 to 100 000 scale well to this new model with larger N. In\nparticular, the timescale to core-collapse (in units of the relaxation\ntimescale), mass segregation, velocity dispersion, and the energies of the\nbinary population all show similar behaviour at different N.",

      "abstract": "Inversion sequences are integer sequences $(\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_n)$ such\nthat $0 \\leqslant \\sigma_i < i$ for all $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$. The study\nof pattern-avoiding inversion sequences began in two independent articles by\nMansour-Shattuck and Corteel-Martinez-Savage-Weselcouch in 2015 and 2016. These\ntwo initial articles solved the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding a\nsingle pattern for every pattern of length 3 except the patterns 010 and 100.\nThe case 100 was recently solved by Mansour and Yildirim. We solve the final\ncase by making use of a decomposition of inversion sequences avoiding the\npattern 010. Our decomposition needs to take into account the maximal value,\nand the number of distinct values occurring in the inversion sequence. We then\nexpand our method to solve the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding the\npairs of patterns $\\{010, 000\\}, \\{010, 110\\}, \\{010, 120\\}$, and the\nWilf-equivalent pairs $\\{010, 201\\} \\sim \\{010, 210\\}$. For each family of\npattern-avoiding inversion sequences considered, its enumeration requires the\nenumeration of some family of constrained words avoiding the same patterns, a\nquestion which we also solve.",

Numerically, one can find all rational points of\nheight < B for B in the range of up to 100 000, thanks to a program due to D.\nJ. Bernstein. On the other hand, there are precise conjectures concerning the\nconstants in the asymptotics of rational points of bounded height due to Manin,\nBatyrev and the authors. Changing the coefficients one can obtain cubic\nsurfaces with rank of the Picard group varying between 1 and 4. We check that\nnumerical data are compatible with the above conjectures. In a previous paper\nwe considered cubic surfaces with Picard groups of rank one with or without\nBrauer-Manin obstruction to weak approximation. In this paper, we test the\nconjectures for diagonal cubic surfaces with Picard groups of higher rank.",

Pellets were heated from room\ntemperature in an evacuated chamber, and solid state reaction proceeded at\n340-350 degrees Celsius in an oxygen atmosphere released by reaction itself (60\n< p < 100 mbar). Electric and magnetic properties appealing for an ambient\ntemperature superconductivity may be attributed to scattering processes\nindicated by tunnelling of Ag-Ag clusters between states localized on the point\ncontacts formed between adjacent particles.

Our method combines Krylov subspace\nmethods with a rational approximation and typically achieves $4$ decimal places\nof accuracy with fewer than $100$ MVMs. Moreover, the backward pass requires\nlittle additional computation. We demonstrate our method's applicability on\nmatrices as large as $50,\\!000 \\times 50,\\!000$ - well beyond traditional\nmethods - with little approximation error. Applying this increased scalability\nto variational Gaussian processes, Bayesian optimization, and Gibbs sampling\nresults in more powerful models with higher accuracy.",
