Quotient sets have attracted the attention of mathematicians in the past three decades. The set of quotients of primes\nis dense in the positive real numbers and the set of all quotients\nof Gaussian primes is also dense in the complex plane. Sittinger\nhas proved that the set of quotients of primes in an imaginary\nquadratic ring is dense in the complex plane and the set of quotients of primes in a real quadratic number ring is dense in R. An\ninteresting open question is introduced by Sittinger: Is the set of\nquotients of Hurwitz primes dense in the quaternions? In this paper, we answer the question and prove that the set of all quotients\nof Hurwitz primes is dense in the quaternions.\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\nQuotient sets like {p/q : p, q are primes} have attracted the attention\nof mathematicians in the past three decades. It has been proved (or\nobserved) many times that the set {p/q : p, q are primes} is dense in\nthe positive real numbers (e.g., [2, Exercise 218], [5, Corollary 5], [6,\nTheorem 4] ). In 2013, Garcia [3] considered the set of all quotients\nof Gaussian primes and proved that it is dense in the complex plane.\nLater Garcia and Luca [4] proved that the set of quotients of nonzero\nFibonacci numbers is dense in the p-adic numbers for every prime p.\nSanna [8] generalized Garcia and Luca\u2019s result and proved that for any\ninteger k \u2265 2 and any prime number p, the set of quotients of nonzero\nk-generalized Fibonacci numbers is dense in the p-adic numbers.\nRecently, Sittinger [9] proved that the set of quotients of primes in\nan imaginary quadratic ring is dense in the complex plane and the set\nof quotients of primes in a real quadratic number ring is dense in R.\nSittinger also asked an interesting open question in his paper: Is the set\nof quotients of Hurwitz primes dense in the quaternions (see Section 2\nfor the definitions)? In this paper, we answer Sittinger\u2019s question and\nprove the following theorem.\n\n\nTheorem 1.1. The set of all quotients of Hurwitz primes is dense in\nthe quaternions.\n\n\nDate: April 18, 2019.\n\n1\n\n\nRemark 1.1. As the multiplication of quaternions is not commutative,\nfor any two non-zero quaternions a, b, their quotient could be defined\nby [b] [=][ ba] [\u2212][1] [ or] [ b] [=][ a] [\u2212][1] [b][ and Theorem 1.1 holds for both cases. In this]\n\n\n\n\n[b]\n\na [=][ ba] [\u2212][1] [ or] [ b] a\n\n\n\nby [b] a [=][ ba] [\u2212][1] [ or] [ b] a [=][ a] [\u2212][1] [b][ and Theorem 1.1 holds for both cases. In this]\n\npaper, we only prove the former case and the proof of the latter case\nis very similar with obvious modifications.\n\n\n\nRemark 1.2. In fact we prove a slightly stronger result than Theorem\n1.1. Hurwitz quaternions could be divided into two disjoint subsets\n(see Section 2 for the notation and definitions)\n\n\nH 1 = {x 1 + x 2 i + x 3 j + x 4 k : x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 \u2208 Z}\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nH 2 = x 1 + x 2 i + x 3 j + x 4 k : x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 \u2208 Z + [1]\n\n2\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n.\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nOur proof indicates that the set\n\np\n\ufffd q [:][ p][ and][ q][ are Hurwitz primes in][ H] [1]\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nis dense in the quaternions. Moreover, for any two Hurwitz primes\np, q \u2208 H 1 with odd norms, it is easy to see that pu, qu are Hurwitz\nprimes belonging to H 2 and [pu] [= (][pu][)(][qu][)] [\u2212][1] [ =] [ p] [, where][ u][ =] [ 1+][i][+][j][+][k] is\n\n\n\nq [, where][ u][ =] [ 1+][i][+] 2 [j][+][k]\n\n\n\nqu [pu] [= (][pu][)(][qu][)] [\u2212][1] [ =] [ p] q\n\n\n\nprimes belonging to H 2 and qu [= (][pu][)(][qu][)] [\u2212] [ =] [ p] q [, where][ u][ =] 2 is\n\na unit in Hurwitz quaternions. Therefore, the set\n\np\n\ufffd q [:][ p][ and][ q][ are Hurwitz primes in][ H] [2] \ufffd\n\n\nis also dense in the quaternions.\n\n\n2. Hurwitz quaternions\n\n\nIn this section, we introduce some properties of quaternions and most\nof the materials can be found in [1].\nThe quaternions were discovered by Irish mathematician Hamilton\nin 1843. They have been widely used in the electrodynamics, general\nrelativity, navigation, satellite attitude control and other fields.\n\n\nDefinition 2.1. The set of quaternions is defined as\n\n\nQ = {x 1 + x 2 i + x 3 j + x 4 k : x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 \u2208 R}\n\n\nwhere i, j, k commute with every real number and satisfy\n\n\nijk = i [2] = j [2] = k [2] = \u22121.\n\n2\n\n\n\nq [:][ p][ and][ q][ are Hurwitz primes in][ H] [2]\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\nLet a = a 1 + a 2 i + a 3 j + a 4 k and b = b 1 + b 2 i + b 3 j + b 4 k be any two\nquaternions. The addition of quaternions is defined by\n\n\na + b = a 1 + b 1 + (a 2 + b 2 )i + (a 3 + b 3 )j + (a 4 + b 4 )k.\n\n\nFor any real number \u03bb, the scalar multiplication is defined by\n\n\n\u03bba = \u03bba 1 + \u03bba 2 i + \u03bba 3 j + \u03bba 4 k.\n\n\nThen the quaternions form a vector space with these two operations.\nMoreover, we can define the multiplication of quaternions by\n\n\nab =(a 1 b 1 \u2212 a 2 b 2 \u2212 a 3 b 3 \u2212 a 4 b 4 ) + (a 1 b 2 + a 2 b 1 + a 3 b 4 \u2212 a 4 b 3 )i\n\n\n+ (a 1 b 3 + a 3 b 1 + a 4 b 2 \u2212 a 2 b 4 )j + (a 1 b 4 + a 4 b 1 + a 2 b 3 \u2212 a 3 b 2 )k.\n\n\nClearly, we have\nij = k and ji = \u2212k\n\nso the multiplication of quaternions is not commutative.\nFor any a = a 1 + a 2 i + a 3 j + a 4 k \u2208 Q, a = a 1 \u2212 a 2 i \u2212 a 3 j \u2212 a 4 k is\ncalled the conjugate of a. It is easy to see that\n\n\naa = a [2] 1 [+][ a] [2] 2 [+][ a] [2] 3 [+][ a] [2] 4 [.]\n\n\nDefinition 2.2. For any a = a 1 + a 2 i + a 3 j + a 4 k \u2208 Q, its norm is\ndefined by\n\u2225a\u2225 = aa = a [2] 1 [+][ a] [2] 2 [+][ a] [2] 3 [+][ a] [2] 4 [.]\n\n\nThe norm induces a metric d(a, b) = |a \u2212 b| on the quaternions by\n\n|a \u2212 b| = \ufffd\u2225a \u2212 b\u2225\n\n\nand the quaternions form a metric space.\n\n\nDefinition 2.3. A subset D of quaternions is said to be dense in the\nquaternions if for any quaternion a and any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a\nquaternion b \u2208 D such that\n\n\n|a \u2212 b| < \u03b5.\n\n\nDefinition 2.4. For any a = a 1 + a 2 i + a 3 j + a 4 k \u2208 Q and \u2225a\u2225\u0338= 0,\nits inverse is defined by\n\n\na\na [\u2212][1] = .\n\u2225a\u2225 [=][ a] [1] [ \u2212] [a] [2] [i][ \u2212] \u2225a\u2225 [a] [3] [j][ \u2212] [a] [4] [k]\n\n\nIn this paper, the quotient of two quaternions is defined by\n\nb\na [=][ ba] [\u2212][1] [.]\n\n\nOne interesting subset of quaternions is the set of Hurwitz quaternions which was introduced by Hurwitz in 1919.\n\n3\n\n\nDefinition 2.5. The set of Hurwitz quaternions H is a subset of\nquaternions, defined as\n\nH = x 1 + x 2 i + x 3 j + x 4 k : x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 \u2208 Z or x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 \u2208 Z + [1]\n\n2\n\n\ufffd\n\n\nWe say that a is a unit in H if \u2225a\u2225 = 1.\n\n\n\n.\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nH = x 1 + x 2 i + x 3 j + x 4 k : x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 \u2208 Z or x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 \u2208 Z + [1]\n\n2\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that for any a \u2208 H, \u2225a\u2225\u2208 Z. Moreover, we have the\nfollowing result.\n\n\nLemma 2.6. Let n be any positive integer. Then the number of Hurwitz quaternions with norm n is\n\n\n\n24\n\ufffd\n\n\nd|n\n2\u2224d\n\n\n\nd.\n\n\n\nDefinition 2.7. We say that p \u2208 H is a Hurwitz prime if p is not zero\nor a unit and is not a product of non-units in H.\n\n\nWe have the following result to determine whether a Hurwitz quaternion is a Hurwitz prime.\n\n\nLemma 2.8. For any p \u2208 H, p is a Hurwitz prime if and only if \u2225p\u2225\nis a prime number.\n\n\n3. Preliminaries\n\n\nIn this section, we introduce some tools which will be used later.\nWe begin with some well-known properties of R [4] . For any two vectors\n\u2212\u2192x = (x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 ), \u2212\u2192y = (y 1, y 2, y 3, y 4 ) \u2208 R 4, the metric is defined by\n\n\n| [\u2212\u2192] x \u2212 [\u2212\u2192] y | = \ufffd(x 1 \u2212 y 1 ) [2] + (x 2 \u2212 y 2 ) [2] + (x 3 \u2212 y 3 ) [2] + (x 4 \u2212 y 4 ) [2]\n\n\nand the inner product is defined by\n\n\u27e8 [\u2212\u2192] x, [\u2212\u2192] y \u27e9 = x 1 y 1 + x 2 y 2 + x 3 y 3 + x 4 y 4 .\n\nClearly | [\u2212\u2192] x | = \ufffd\u27e8 [\u2212\u2192] x, [\u2212\u2192] x \u27e9. It is well-known that\n\n(3.1) | [\u2212\u2192] x \u2212 [\u2212\u2192] y | [2] = | [\u2212\u2192] x | [2] + | [\u2212\u2192] y | [2] \u2212 2\u27e8 [\u2212\u2192] x, [\u2212\u2192] y \u27e9.\n\n\nDefine a map \u03c3 from Q to R [4] by\n\n\n\u03c3 : Q \u2192 R [4]\n\n\nx 1 + x 2 i + x 3 j + x 4 k \u2192 (x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 ).\n\n\nThen it is easy to see that \u03c3 is an isomorphism. Moreover, \u03c3 is also an\nisometry and\n\n\n(3.2) |\u03c3(a) \u2212 \u03c3(b)| = |a \u2212 b|\n4\n\n\nfor any a, b \u2208 Q.\nNext, we introduce our main tool. Denote by S the four dimensional\nhypersphere\nx [2] 1 [+][ x] [2] 2 [+][ x] [2] 3 [+][ x] [2] 4 [= 1][.]\nFor any 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0 and [\u2212\u2192] x \u2208 R [4], define\n\n\n\u2212\u2192 4\n\u2126( [\u2212\u2192] x, \u03b8) = y \u2208 R : |\u2212\u2192y | = 1 and arccos [\u27e8\u2212\u2192][x,][ \u2212\u2192][y][ \u27e9] .\n\ufffd | [\u2212\u2192] x || [\u2212\u2192] y | [\u2264] [\u03b8] \ufffd\n\n\u2126( [\u2212\u2192] x, \u03b8) is a hyperspherical cap in S and denote by A(\u2126( [\u2212\u2192] x, \u03b8)) its\nsurface area. Clearly A(\u2126( [\u2212\u2192] x, \u03b8)) is a positive real number and only\ndepends on \u03b8 and [\u2212\u2192] x .\nDefine\n\n\u2212\u2192\n(3.3) r(n, \u2126( [\u2212\u2192] x, \u03b8)) = # \ufffd\u2212\u2192y \u2208 Z 4 : |\u2212\u2192y | = [\u221a] n and \u221ayn \u2208 \u2126( [\u2212\u2192] x, \u03b8)\ufffd .\n\n\nThe following theorem is a special case of [7, Theorem 1] with Q(X) =\nx [2] 1 [+][ x] [2] 2 [+][ x] [2] 3 [+][ x] [2] 4 [and \u2126= \u2126(][\u2212\u2192][x, \u03b8][).]\n\n\nTheorem 3.1. Let notation be as above. For any positive integer n\nwith (n, 2) = 1 and \u03b5 > 0, we have\n\nr(n, \u2126( [\u2212\u2192] x, \u03b8)) = r(n) [A][(\u2126(][\u2212\u2192][x, \u03b8][))] \ufffd1 + O \ufffdn [\u2212][1][/][7+][\u03b5] [\ufffd\ufffd],\n\nA(S)\n\nwhere r(n) is the number of integral solutions of x [2] 1 [+][ x] [2] 2 [+][ x] [2] 3 [+][ x] [2] 4 [=][ n]\nand A(S) is the surface area of S.\n\n\nRemark 3.1. By the famous Jacobi\u2019s four-square theorem, we have\n\n\n\n(3.4) r(n) =\n\n\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\n\n8 m if n is odd,\n\ufffd\n\nm|n\n\n\n\n24\n\ufffd\n\n\nm|n\n2\u2224m\n\n\n\nm if n is even.\n\n\n\n4. Proof of Theorem 1.1\n\n\n\nIt is sufficient to prove that for any quaternion h and any \u03b5 > 0,\nthere exist two Hurwitz primes p, q such that\n\np\nh \u2212 < \u03b5.\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd q \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\nWe first consider the case \u2225h\u2225 = 0. Since the set of all quotients of\nprime numbers is dense in positive real numbers, there exist two prime\n\n5\n\n\n\nq\n\n\n\n< \u03b5.\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\nnumbers p, q such that p/q < \u03b5 [2] .
