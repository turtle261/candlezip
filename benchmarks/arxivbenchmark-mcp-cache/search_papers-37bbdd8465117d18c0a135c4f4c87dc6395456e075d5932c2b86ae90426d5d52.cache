When expressed in closed form, it is given by\nZ(s, x) = (s -- 1)$\\zeta$(s) + 1 x Li s z z -- 1 dz, where Li s (x) is the\npolylogarithm function. As an immediate first application of the new\nparametrized series, a new expression of $\\zeta$(s) follows: (s -- 1)$\\zeta$(s)\n= -- 1 0 Li s z z -- 1 dz. As a second important application, using the\nfunctional equation and exploiting uniform convergence of the series defining\nZ(s, x), we have for any non-trivial zero s",

For some numerical\nsemigroups, $L(s+n_1) = L(s) + 1$ for all $s \\in S$ or $\\ell(s+n_k) = \\ell(s) +\n1$ for all $s \\in S$. In a general commutative, cancellative semigroup $S$, it\nis also possible to have $L(s+m) = L(s) + 1$ for some atom $m$ and all $s \\in\nS$ or to have $\\ell(s+m) = \\ell(s) + 1$ for some atom $m$ and all $s \\in S$. We\ndetermine necessary and sufficient conditions for these two phenomena. We then\ngeneralize the notions of Kunz posets and Kunz polytopes. Each integer point on\na Kunz polytope corresponds to a commutative, cancellative semigroup. We\ndetermine which integer points on a given Kunz polytope correspond to semigroup\nin which $L(s+m) = L(s) + 1$ for all $s$ and similarly which integer points\nyield semigroups for which $\\ell(s+m) = \\ell(s) + 1$ for all $s$.",

For a subset $A$ of\nvertices of the hypercube $Q_n$ and $n\\geq d$, let $\\lambda(n,d,s,A)$ denote\nthe fraction of subcubes $Q_d$ of $Q_n$ that contain exactly $s$ vertices of\n$A$. Let $\\lambda(n,d,s)$ denote the maximum possible value of\n$\\lambda(n,d,s,A)$ as $A$ ranges over all subsets of vertices of $Q_n$, and let\n$\\lambda(d,s)$ denote the limit of this quantity as $n$ tends to infinity. We\nprove several lower and upper bounds on $\\lambda(d,s)$, showing that for all\nadmissible values of $d$ and $s$ it is larger than $0.28$. We also show that\nthe values of $s=s(d)$ such that $\\lambda(d,s)=1$ are exactly\n$\\{0,2^{d-1},2^d\\}$.

For starting numbers of specific residue classes\n($mod\\ 12\\cdot2^h$) or ($mod\\ 12\\cdot2^{t+1}$) the finite subsequences have the\nsame length $h,t$. It is conjectured that for each $h,t\\geq2$ the number of all\nadmissible residue classes is given exactly by the Fibonacci sequence. This has\nbeen proved for $2\\leq h,t\\leq50$.\n  Collatz's conjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that for each\n$s\\in\\mathbb{N},s>1$, there exists $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $T^k(s)<s$. The\nleast $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $T^k(s)<s$ is called the stopping time of $s$,\nwhich we will denote by $\\sigma(s)$.
