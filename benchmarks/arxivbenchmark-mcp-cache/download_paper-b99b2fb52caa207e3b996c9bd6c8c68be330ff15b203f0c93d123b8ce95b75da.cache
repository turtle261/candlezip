Sedlack, [1, 2] and John M. Doyle [1, 2]\n\n1 _Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA_\n2 _Department of Physics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA_\n\n\nWe perform magnetically-assisted Sisyphus laser cooling of the triatomic free radical strontium monohydroxide (SrOH). This is achieved with principal optical cycling in the rotationally closed _P_ ( _N_ _[\u2032\u2032]_ = 1) branch of either\nthe _X_ [\u02dc] [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) _\u2194_ _A_ [\u02dc] [2] \u03a0 1 _/_ 2 (000) or the _X_ [\u02dc] [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) _\u2194_ _B_ [\u02dc] [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) vibronic transitions. Molecules lost into the\nexcited vibrational states during the cooling process are repumped back through the _B_ [\u02dc] (000) state for both the\n(100) level of the Sr-O stretching mode and the \ufffd02 [0] 0\ufffd level of the bending mode. The transverse temperature\nof a SrOH molecular beam is reduced in one dimension by two orders of magnitude to _\u223c_ 700 _\u00b5_ K. This approach opens a path towards creating a variety of ultracold polyatomic molecules, including much larger ones,\nby means of direct laser cooling.\n\n\n\nCompared to atoms, the additional rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom in molecules give rise to a wide\nvariety of potential and realized scientific applications, including quantum computation [1\u20133], precision measurements\n\n[4\u20137], and quantum simulation [8, 9]. While ultracold diatomic molecules will be extremely valuable in opening novel\nresearch frontiers, molecules with three or more atoms have\nunique capabilities enabled by their significantly more complicated structure [10\u201316]. For all molecules to achieve their\nfull scientific potential, they must be cooled. Yet, the desired quantum complexity that molecules provide also leads\nto challenges for control, detection, and cooling [17]. Assembling ultracold molecules from two laser-cooled atoms has\nrepresented one solution and has created ultracold bi-alkali\nmolecules [18\u201322], including filling of optical lattices with\nKRb [23]. There are several direct cooling techniques that\ntogether routinely cool a much wider variety of molecules\ninto the Kelvin regime [17, 24]. Intense research is ongoing to bring these cold molecules into the ultracold regime\n( _<_ 1 mK). Even though there has been experimental progress\non control of polyatomics [25\u201330], optoelectrical cooling of\nformaldehyde is the only technique that has resulted in a\ntrapped sub-millikelvin sample [31].\n\n\nCooling of the external motion of neutral atoms from above\nroom temperature into the sub-millikelvin range (leading to,\ne.g., Bose-Einstein condensation) commonly relies on the use\nof velocity-dependent optical forces [32]. Laser cooling requires reasonably closed and strong optical electronic transitions, so its use for molecules has been severely limited.\nRecently, following initial theoretical proposals [33, 34] and\nproof-of-principle experimental results [35], laser cooling has\nbeen achieved for SrF [36], YO [37], and CaF [38, 39], including a magneto-optical trap for SrF [40\u201342]. Motivated by\nthis progress on diatomic molecules, and building upon previous theoretical work [43], we recently demonstrated photon\ncycling \u2013 a crucial requirement for achieving light induced\nforces \u2013 with the triatomic molecule SrOH [44].\n\n\nIn this Letter, we report the Sisyphus laser cooling of a\npolyatomic molecule. The dissipative force for compressing\nphase-space volume is achieved by a combination of spatially\n\n\n\nvarying light shifts and optical pumping into dark sub-levels,\nwhich are then remixed by a static magnetic field, as explored\npreviously in atomic systems [45, 46]. Since the magnitude\nof the induced friction force is directly related to the modulation depth of the dressed energy levels, the cooling process\ncan be much more efficient than with Doppler radiation pressure forces [47, 48]. This enhancement is especially important for complex polyatomic molecules, where scattering the\nthousands of photons necessary for Doppler cooling becomes\nmore challenging due to additional vibrational modes. Here,\nwe demonstrate transverse cooling (and heating) of a SrOH\nbeam using two different electronic transitions, study loss\nchannels to vibrational states (including the bending mode),\nand highlight proposed extensions to more complex species.\n\n\nOur work with SrOH uses the cryogenic buffer-gas beam\n(CBGB) [49], which is also used in all other experiments\non laser cooling of molecules. The study of SrOH buffergas cooling dynamics, as well as precise measurements of its\nmomentum transfer and inelastic cross sections with helium,\nwere previously performed [50]. In brief, SrOH can be produced efficiently with ablation and forms an intense CBGB.\nFig. 1 shows a simplified schematic diagram of the current\nexperimental apparatus. Detailed descriptions of this apparatus have also been provided elsewhere [51]. Laser ablation of Sr(OH) 2 produces SrOH molecules that are then entrained in helium buffer gas ( _T_ He _\u223c_ 2 K) that flows out of the\ncell into a beam. He flow is 6 standard cubic centimeters per\nminute (sccm), and the beam is extracted through a 5 mm diameter aperture. This CBGB contains _\u223c_ 10 [9] molecules in the\nfirst excited rotational level ( _N_ = 1) in a pulse _\u223c_ 5 ms long.\nThe forward velocity of the SrOH beam is _v_ _x_ _\u223c_ 130 m _/_ s and\nits transverse velocity spread is _\u25b3v_ _y_ _\u223c\u00b1_ 15 m _/_ s. A 2 _\u00d7_ 2\nmm square aperture situated 15 cm away from the cell collimates the beam, resulting in an effective transverse temperature _T_ _\u22a5_ _\u223c_ 50 mK.\n\n\nTo laser cool, we use a photon cycling scheme that we\nalso employed in an earlier work, as described in detail in\n_BX_ Ref. [44]. The main photon cycling path is \u02dc\u02dc [2][2] \u03a3\u03a3 [+][+] ((000100)) (611 nm) and the first vibrational repump is _\u2192_ _B_ \u02dc [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) (631 nm), as shown in Fig. 1 (In- _X_ [\u02dc] [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) _\u2192_\n\n\nteraction region). The combined main and repump laser light,\nwith diameter of _\u223c_ 3 mm, propagates in the _y_ direction and\nmakes 5 round-trip passes between two mirrors before it is\nretroreflected back in order to create a standing wave. The\nmolecule-laser interaction time is _t_ int _\u223c_ 115 _\u00b5_ s. Each color\n(611 nm and 631 nm) includes two frequency components\nseparated by _\u223c_ 110 MHz to address the _P_ 11 ( _J_ _[\u2032\u2032]_ = 1 _._ 5) and\n_P_ _\u2032\u2032_\n_Q_ 12 ( _J_ = 0 _._ 5) lines of the spin-rotation (SR) splitting. We\nalso study cooling using the _X_ [\u02dc] [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) _\u2192_ _A_ [\u02dc] [2] \u03a0 1 _/_ 2 (000) excitation at 688 nm as the main transition. Each SR component of the 688 nm light is generated using separate injectionlocked laser diodes seeded by external-cavity diode lasers in\nthe Littrow configuration [52] resulting in _\u223c_ 15 mW per SR\ncomponent in the interaction region. The 611 nm light, as\nwell as all of the repumping light, is generated by cw dye\nlasers passing through acousto-optic modulators resulting in\n\n_\u223c_\n50 mW per SR component. In order to destabilize dark\nstates created during the cycling process [53], we apply a mag\n\n\n2\n\n\nnetic field of a few gauss. Due to the vibrational angular momentum selection rule [54], the dominant loss channel for the\nbending mode is to the _v_ 2 = 2 state with _l_ = 0 [55] denoted\n\ufffd02 [0] 0\ufffd. Further details regarding the photon cycling scheme\nused for SrOH have been previously described [44].\nThe spatial profile of the molecular beam is recorded by\nimaging laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) in the Detection region. The molecules are excited using a transverse retroreflected laser beam and LIF photons are imaged onto an\nEMCCD camera. The detection laser addresses both SR\n_A_ components of the\u02dc [2] \u03a0 1 _/_ 2 (000) transition, as shown in Fig. _P_ ( _N_ _[\u2032\u2032]_ = 1) line for the _X_ [\u02dc] 1 (Detection). [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) _\u2192_\nIn a similar laser configuration, time of flight (ToF) data\nis recorded by collecting the LIF on a PMT (further downstream). In order to boost the LIF signal there is a Clean-up\nregion where all of the molecular population is pumped into\nthe ground state ( _X_ [\u02dc] (000)) from the excited vibrational levels\n( _X_ [\u02dc] (100) and _X_ [\u02dc] \ufffd02 [0] 0\ufffd). This is done with off-diagonal excitation to _B_ [\u02dc] (000), as shown in Fig. 1 (Clean-up).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Schematic of the experimental apparatus (not to scale). A cryogenic beam of SrOH is produced using laser ablation of a pressed\nSr(OH) 2 target followed by buffer-gas cooling with _\u223c_ 2 K helium gas. To apply the cooling forces on the collimated molecular beam, we use\ntransverse lasers retroreflected between two mirrors in order to generate a standing wave. All of the lasers are resonant with the _P_ ( _N_ _[\u2032\u2032]_ = 1)\n_A_ rotationally-closed line of the corresponding electronic transition. Depending on the experimental configuration, either the \u02dc [2] \u03a0 1 _/_ 2 (000) or the \u02dc _X_ [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) _\u2192_ _B_ \u02dc [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) cooling transition is used with an additional \u02dc _X_ [2] \u03a3 [+] (100) _\u2192_ _B_ \u02dc [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) laser for repumping _X_ [\u02dc] [2] \u03a3 [+] (000) _\u2192_\nmolecules decaying to the vibrationally excited Sr-O stretching mode. In order to remix dark magnetic sub-levels, a magnetic field is applied\nin the interaction region. Before the detection is performed, molecules remaining in either (100) or \ufffd02 [0] 0\ufffd excited vibrational levels of the\nelectronic ground state are optically pumped back into the ground vibrational level using _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2192_ _B_ [\u02dc] off-diagonal excitations. The spatial profile\nof the molecular beam is imaged on the electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera and the time-of-flight (ToF) data is\ncollected on the photomultiplier tube (PMT). The vibrational quantum numbers \ufffd _v_ 1 _v_ _[l]_ 2 _[v]_ [3] \ufffd correspond to the Sr _\u2194_ OH stretching ( _v_ 1 ), Sr-O-H\nbending ( _v_ 2 ), and SrO _\u2194_ H stretching ( _v_ 3 ) vibrational modes. The superscript _l_ next to the bending mode vibrational quantum number indicates\nthe projection of the vibrational angular momentum on the internuclear axis.\n\n\n\nFig. 2 shows 2D camera images of the molecular beam\nfor various detunings of the _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212_ _B_ [\u02dc] cooling laser. Phase-space\ncompression is clearly visible in the comparison between images (b), \u03b4 = 0, and (d), \u03b4 _>_ 0, cooling.\n\n\n\n_B_ \u02dc cycling transitions, we plot integrated 1D (To characterize the cooling efficacy for both _x_ axis) beam pro- _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212_ _A_ [\u02dc] and _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212_\nfiles for both cooling configurations in Fig. 3. The most effective laser cooling was demonstrated using _X_ [\u02dc] (000) _\u2212_ _B_ [\u02dc] (000)\n\n\ntransition at 611 nm with laser intensity _I_ = 1 _._ 4 W _/_ cm [2], resulting in a saturation parameter _s \u223c_ 20 (Fig. 3(a)). From\nthe fits to the data and a comparison to Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations of the molecular beam kinetics we determine the\n\nfinal beam temperature _T_ _\u22a5_ _\u223c_ 700 _\u00b5_ K, which corresponds to a\nfactor of 70 reduction as compared to the \u03b4 = 0 detuning. Because of the high damping rate, we achieve lower transverse\ntemperature than previously demonstrated with a 1D MOT of\ndiatomic molecules [37], with half the interaction length.\nCooling using the _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212_ _A_ [\u02dc] transition was less effective. Fig.\n3(b) shows typical molecular beam profiles after interacting\nwith a cooling laser exciting the _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212_ _A_ [\u02dc] transition at 688 nm\nwith intensity of _I_ = 424 mW _/_ cm [2] and a saturation parameter\n_s \u223c_ 8. For a positive detuning we observe cooling of the SrOH\nbeam represented by the increased molecular density near the\ncenter due to the narrowing of the spatial distribution. By\n\n\n\n3\n\n\ncomparing the fitted width of the resulting profile with a MC\nsimulation we conclude that the beam is cooled to a final temperature of _\u223c_ 2 mK, an order of magnitude above the Doppler\nlimit of _\u223c_ 200 _\u00b5_ K.\nIn order to extract the number of scattered photons during\nthe cooling process, we determine the fraction of the remaining molecules after the cooling process with ToF PMT data\ntaken without the \ufffd02 [0] 0\ufffd clean-up beam. Using the previously measured decay rate to dark vibrational levels (above\u02dc\n_X_ (100)) of (3 _\u00b1_ 1) _\u00d7_ 10 _[\u2212]_ [3] [44], we calculate that on average\neach molecule emits 220 [+] _\u2212_ [110] 60 [photons with a scattering rate of]\n\u0393 scat = 2 _\u00b1_ 1 MHz. In such a configuration, Doppler cooling\nfrom radiation-pressure molasses does not play a significant\nrole [47]. By adding the \ufffd02 [0] 0\ufffd clean-up beam, we determine that _\u223c_ 10% of molecules decay to the \ufffd02 [0] 0\ufffd state of\nthe bending mode during the cooling process.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Spatial images of the molecular beam taken at different detunings of the _X_ [\u02dc] (000) _\u2212_ _B_ [\u02dc] (000) cooling laser: (b) on resonance, (c) reddetuned (-10 MHz), and (d) blue-detuned (+10 MHz). The same color axis is used for all three plots. SrOH beam is moving in the _x_ direction\nwhile the cooling laser is applied in the _y_ direction as shown in (a). Narrowing of the spatial size of the molecular cloud with accompanying\ndensity increase in (d) compared to (b) in the _y_ dimension indicates phase-space compression.\n\n\n\nFor negative detunings the molecules are expelled from the\nregion around _v_ _y_ = 0, leading to a double-peak structure that is\na signature of the magnetically-assisted Sisyphus effect [45].\nCompared to the results of cycling on the _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212_ _A_ [\u02dc] transition\n(Fig. 3(b)), the use of the _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212B_ [\u02dc] transition (Fig. 3(a)) increases\nthe separation between the peaks from 2 _._ 95 _\u00b1_ 0 _._ 04 mm to\n7 _._ 54 _\u00b1_ 0 _._ 04 mm for \u03b4 _<_ 0. Our findings are in good agreement\nwith previous studies of sub-Doppler laser cooling in complex\nmultilevel atomic [56] and molecular systems [36, 57].\nIn summary, we demonstrate Sisyphus laser cooling of the\npolyatomic molecule SrOH. We reduce the transverse temperature of a cryogenic buffer-gas beam from 50 mK to 700 _\u00b5_ K\nwith _\u223c_ 200 scattered photons per molecule. Laser cooling\nof atoms is a mature scientific field [58\u201360] with well developed experimental [61, 62] and theoretical [63, 64] techniques. Our results with SrOH open up a wide range of future\ndirections for laser manipulation of polyatomic molecules.\nCooling SrOH motion with magnetically-assisted laser cooling close to the recoil temperature of _\u223c_ 1 _\u00b5_ K should be possible by increasing the interaction time and optimizing laser\npower [65, 66]. Extending the scheme to 2D and using more\nelaborate optical configurations would lead to significantly increased brightening of the molecular beam [66, 67]. Slowing\nand cooling of an atomic beam in the longitudinal dimension\n\n[68, 69], e.g. for loading into a MOT, could now be extended\nto polyatomic molecules.\n\n\n\nWhile some of these research avenues might require repumping of other vibrational states beyond the (100) and\n\ufffd02 [0] 0\ufffd states as the number of scattered photons increases,\nthis challenge can be solved with additional repumping lasers\non the _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212_ _B_ [\u02dc] transition. Since the strengths of higher-order\nFranck-Condon factors decrease rapidly [55, 70], scattering of\n_\u223c_ 10 _,_ 000 photons should be possible with only two additional\nlasers to address (200) and (01 [1] 0) states. All of the required\nfrequencies can be generated with solid-state laser diodes that\nhave easily attainable requisite powers [71]. Moreover, by using _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212_ _A_ [\u02dc] electronic excitation for laser cooling and _X_ [\u02dc] _\u2212_ _B_ [\u02dc]\nexcitation for repumping, the scattering rate becomes independent of the number of repumping lasers, ensuring rapid\noptical cycling at a maximum possible rate.\n\n\nWhile SrOH has a linear geometry in the vibronic ground\nstate, it still serves as a useful test candidate for the feasibility of laser cooling more complex, nonlinear molecules like\nstrontium monoalkoxide free radicals, where hydrogen is replaced by a more complex group R (e.g. R = CH 3 ). Since\nSrOR molecules share a number of properties with SrOH, including a very ionic Sr-O bond, diagonal Franck-Condon factors, and technically accessible laser transitions [72, 73], results presented in this paper could naturally be extended to\nsuch complex species [74].\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u221210 \u22128 \u22126 \u22124 \u22122 0 2 4 6 8\n\n\nRelative2position2(mm)\n\n\n\n\u221210 \u22128 \u22126 \u22124 \u22122 0 2 4 6 8\n\n\nRelative2position2(mm)\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Integrated molecular beam profiles for different detunings of the cooling laser: (a) _X_ [\u02dc] (000) _\u2212_ _B_ [\u02dc] (000) and (b) _X_ [\u02dc] (000) _\u2212_ _A_ [\u02dc] (000). The\ndetunings from resonance are given by \u03b4 = _\u00b1_ 10 MHz. With a positive detuning, the width of the molecular beam is reduced, which indicates\ncooling of the molecular beam: (a) 9 _._ 4 _\u00b1_ 0 _._ 3 mm to 1 _._ 67 _\u00b1_ 0 _._ 03 mm and (b) 6 _._ 3 _\u00b1_ 0 _._ 1 mm to 2 _._ 1 _\u00b1_ 0 _._ 1 mm. A \u201chole\u201d around zero for \u03b4 _<_ 0\nrepresents a heating signature of the magnetically-assisted Sisyphus effect with the widening of the total spatial distribution. An asymmetry in\nthe height of two peaks comes from imperfect alignment between laser and molecular beams and was previously seen in similar experiments\nwith atoms [47]. The excess signal above the fit near zero position for the on resonance trace in (b) is potentially indicative of a slightly positive\ndetuning of the cooling lasers.\n\n\n\nWe would like to thank D.
