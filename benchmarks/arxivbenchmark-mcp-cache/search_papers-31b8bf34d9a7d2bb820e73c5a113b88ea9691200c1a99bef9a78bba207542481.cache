      "abstract": "Fibonacci word fractals are a class of fractals that have been studied\nrecently, though the word they are generated from is more widely studied in\ncombinatorics. The Fibonacci word can be used to draw a curve which possesses\nself-similarities determined by the recursive structure of the word. The\nHausdorff dimension of the scaling limit of the finite Fibonacci word curves is\ncomputed for $i$-Fibonacci curves and any drawing angle between $0$ and\n$\\pi/2$.",

We discover, fully describe, and prove a surprisingly rich structure\nalready in the set of Ulam words containing exactly two $1$'s. In particular,\nthis leads to a complete description of such words and a logarithmic-time\nalgorithm to determine whether a binary word with two $1$'s is Ulam. Along the\nway, we uncover delicate parity and biperiodicity properties, as well as sharp\nbounds on the number of $0$'s outside the two $1$'s. We also show that sets of\nUlam words indexed by the number $y$ of $0$'s between the two $1$'s have\nintricate tensor-based hierarchical structures determined by the arithmetic\nproperties of $y$. This allows us to construct an infinite family of\nself-similar Ulam-word-based fractals indexed by the set of $2$-adic integers,\ncontaining the outward Sierpinski gasket as a special case.",

These words arise in the context of indexed binary jumbled\npattern matching, where the aim is to decide whether a word has a factor with a\ngiven number of $1$s and $0$s (a given Parikh vector). Each binary word has an\nassociated set of Parikh vectors of the factors of the word. Using prefix\nnormal words, we provide a characterization of the equivalence class of binary\nwords having the same set of Parikh vectors of their factors.\n  We prove that the language of prefix normal words is not context-free and is\nstrictly contained in the language of pre-necklaces, which are prefixes of\npowers of Lyndon words.

      "abstract": "Two finite words are k-binomially equivalent if each subword (i.e.,\nsubsequence) of length at most k occurs the same number of times in both words.\nThe k-binomial complexity of an infinite word is a function that maps the\ninteger $n\\geq 0$ to the number of k-binomial equivalence classes represented\nby its factors of length n. The Thue--Morse (TM) word and its generalization to\nlarger alphabets are ubiquitous in mathematics due to their rich combinatorial\nproperties. This work addresses the k-binomial complexities of generalized TM\nwords. Prior research by Lejeune, Leroy, and Rigo determined the k-binomial\ncomplexities of the 2-letter TM word. For larger alphabets, work by L\\\"u, Chen,\nWen, and Wu determined the 2-binomial complexity for m-letter TM words, for\narbitrary m, but the exact behavior for $k\\geq 3$ remained unresolved. They\nconjectured that the k-binomial complexity function of the m-letter TM word is\neventually periodic with period $m^k$. We resolve the conjecture positively by\nderiving explicit formulae for the k-binomial complexity functions for any\ngeneralized TM word. We do this by characterizing k-binomial equivalence among\nfactors of generalized TM words. This comprehensive analysis not only solves\nthe open conjecture, but also develops tools such as abelian Rauzy graphs.",

      "abstract": "The factor complexity function $C_w(n)$ of a finite or infinite word $w$\ncounts the number of distinct factors of $w$ of length $n$ for each $n \\ge 0$.\nA finite word $w$ of length $|w|$ is said to be trapezoidal if the graph of its\nfactor complexity $C_w(n)$ as a function of $n$ (for $0 \\leq n \\leq |w|$) is\nthat of a regular trapezoid (or possibly an isosceles triangle); that is,\n$C_w(n)$ increases by 1 with each $n$ on some interval of length $r$, then\n$C_w(n)$ is constant on some interval of length $s$, and finally $C_w(n)$\ndecreases by 1 with each $n$ on an interval of the same length $r$. Necessarily\n$C_w(1)=2$ (since there is one factor of length $0$, namely the empty word), so\nany trapezoidal word is on a binary alphabet. Trapezoidal words were first\nintroduced by de Luca (1999) when studying the behaviour of the factor\ncomplexity of finite Sturmian words, i.e., factors of infinite \"cutting\nsequences\", obtained by coding the sequence of cuts in an integer lattice over\nthe positive quadrant of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ made by a line of irrational slope.\nEvery finite Sturmian word is trapezoidal, but not conversely. However, both\nfamilies of words (trapezoidal and Sturmian) are special classes of so-called\n\"rich words\" (also known as \"full words\") - a wider family of finite and\ninfinite words characterized by containing the maximal number of palindromes -\nstudied in depth by the first author and others in 2009.\n  In this paper, we introduce a natural generalization of trapezoidal words\nover an arbitrary finite alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$, called generalized trapezoidal\nwords (or GT-words for short). In particular, we study combinatorial and\nstructural properties of this new class of words, and we show that, unlike the\nbinary case, not all GT-words are rich in palindromes when $|\\mathcal{A}| \\geq\n3$, but we can describe all those that are rich.",
