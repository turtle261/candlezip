While\ncomputationally this is not a desired feature, we will see in this paper that the series leads to very interesting\ntheoretical results. In Section 2, we recall the globally convergent series studied in [4]. In Section 3, we\nparametrize this series using Abel type parametrization and extract some its main properties. The main\nsection of the paper is Section 4 in which we apply the parametrized series to qualitatively characterizing\nthe nontrivial zeros of \u03b6(s). In Section 5, we investigate the possibility of obtaining similar results to other\nwell-known globally convergent series of \u03b6(s), and in Section 6, we conclude with several remarks.\n\n### 2 A Globally Convergent Series for (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s)\n\n\nThis section is based on the author\u2019s papers [4, 5].

However, formula (2.14) remains valid for Re(s) > 0 since\nthe integral (2.11) is well-defined for Re(s) > 0. This prove the validity of the series representation for\nRe(s) > 0.\nIn order to prove that the series is valid for all s \u2208 C, we can either use the method of analytic continuation\nusing repeated integration by parts of the right hand side of (2.11) as it was carried out in [5, Corollary 2.2],\nor we can explicitly bound the sum S n (s) when n is large. We opt for the second method by establishing a\nlemma which is interesting in its own right. The lemma provides an estimate of the exact asymptotic order\nof growth of S n (s) when n is large.\n\n\n1\nLemma 2.2. For n large enough, S n (s) \u223c n(log n) [1][\u2212][s] \u0393(s) [when][ s][ \u2208] [C][,][ s /][\u2208{][0][,][ \u00b1][1][,][ \u00b1][2][,][ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7}][, and for]\n\nk \u2208{0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} and n large enough, S n (k) \u223c [(log][ n][)] [k][\u2212][1]\n\nn(k \u2212 1)! [(][k][ \u0338][= 0][) and][ S] [n] [(][\u2212][k][) = 0][.]\n\n\n3\n\n\nProof. By looking at the definition of S n (s), we can see that S n (s) are the Stirling numbers of the second\nkind modulo a multiplicative factor when s \u2208{0, \u22121, \u22122, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7}. Therefore, when s = \u2212k, k a positive integer,\nS n (\u2212k) = 0 for n \u2265 k + 1; hence, they are eventually zero for n large enough.\nFor s /\u2208{0, \u22121, \u22122, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7}, an asymptotic estimate of S n (s) can be obtained for n large.

With a slight\nmodification of notation, the authors in [6] have shown that \u2206 n (\u03bb) has the following asymptotics when n is\nlarge\n\n\n\u2206 n (\u03bb) \u223c [\u2212][(log][ n][)] [\u03bb] (2.16)\n\n\u0393(1 + \u03bb)\n\n\nwhen \u03bb is nonintegral [6, Theorem 3], and the following expansion\n\n\n\u2206 n (k \u2212 1) \u223c \u2212 [(log][ n][)] [k][\u2212][1] (2.17)\n\n(k \u2212 1)!\n\n\nwhen k \u2208{1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } [6, Eq. (9)]. Thus, when s is nonintegral, we can apply these results to \u2206 n (\u03bb) with\n\u03bb = s \u2212 1 to get\n\n\u2206 n (s \u2212 1) \u223c [\u2212][(log][ n][)] [s][\u2212][1], (2.18)\n\n\u0393(s)\n\n\nwhich leads to the result\n1\nS n (s) \u223c (2.19)\nn(log n) [1][\u2212][s] \u0393(s) [.]\n\n\nSimilarly, when s = k \u2208{1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} we obtain the following expansion\n\n\nS n (k) \u223c [(log][ n][)] [k][\u2212][2] (2.20)\n\n(k \u2212 1)! [.]\n\n\nThe asymptotic estimates (2.19) and (2.20) are valid for n large enough and for all s such that \u211c(s) > 0.\nThis proves the lemma.\n\n\nTo prove that our series (2.2) is well-defined and valid for all s \u2208 C, we note that the logarithmic test\nof series implies that our series is dominated by an absolutely uniformly convergent series for all finite s\nsuch that Re(s) > 0. Now, by Weierstrass theorem of the uniqueness of analytic continuation, the function\n(s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s), initially well-defined by (1.1) for Re(s) > 1, can be extended outside of the domain Re(s) > 1\nand that it does not have any singularity when Re(s) > 0. Moreover, by repeating the same process for\nRe(s) > \u2212k, k \u2208 N, it is clear that the series defines an analytic continuation of \u03b6(s) valid for all s \u2208 C.\nTo finish the proof of the theorem, we now need to justify the interchange of summation and integration\nin (2.8). The interchange is indeed valid because the series\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\n\ufffd 0\u221e\n\n\n\n(1 \u2212 e [\u2212][t] ) [n][\u2212][1]\n\ne [\u2212][t] t [s][\u2212][1] dt (2.21)\nn + 1\n\n\n4\n\n\nconverges absolutely and uniformly for 0 < t < \u221e. To prove this, it suffices to show uniform convergence\nfor the dominating series\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\n\ufffd 0\u221e\n\n\n\n(1 \u2212 e [\u2212][t] ) [n][\u2212][1]\n\ne [\u2212][t] t [\u03c3][\u2212][1] dt, (2.22)\nn + 1\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c3 = Re(s). Indeed, let K = max((1 \u2212 e [\u2212][t] ) [n][\u2212][1] e [\u2212][t/][2] ), 0 < t < \u221e. A straightforward calculation of the\nderivative shows that\n\n\n1 1\nK = (1 \u2212, (2.23)\n2n \u2212 1 [)] [n][\u2212][1] \u221a2n \u2212 1\n\n\nand that the maximum is attained when e [\u2212][t] = 2n1\u22121 [. Now, for][ n][ \u2265] [2, we have]\n\n\n\n\ufffd 0\u221e\n\n\n\n\u221e \u221e\n\n(1 \u2212 e [\u2212][t] ) [n][\u2212][1] e [\u2212][t] t [\u03c3][\u2212][1] dt =\n0 \ufffd 0\n\n\n\n(1 \u2212 e [\u2212][t] ) [n][\u2212][1] e [\u2212][t/][2] e [\u2212][t/][2] t [\u03c3][\u2212][1] ) dt\n0\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\u2264 K e [\u2212][t/][2] t [\u03c3][\u2212][1] dt\n\ufffd 0\n\n\n\n1\n= (1 \u2212\n2n \u2212 1 [)] [n][\u2212][1] [ 2] \u221a [\u03c3] 2n [\u0393(] \u2212 [\u03c3][)] 1\n\n\nK [\u2032]\n\u2264 . (2.24)\n\u221a2n \u2212 1\n\n\nThe last inequality implies that each term of the dominating series is bounded by K [\u2032] /(n + 1) [\u221a] 2n \u2212 1.\nThus the dominating series converges by the comparison test. This completes the proof of the theorem.\n\n### 3 Power Series to Parametrize \u03b6(s)\n\n\nIn order to shed some light on the nature of convergence of a series, the original series are often\nparametrized using a new complex variable x. The most useful and most natural parametrization is the\nso-called Abel parametrization. The new parametrized series is a power series, and the utility of Abel\u2019s\nconstruction via Abel\u2019s theorem for power series is to relate the limit (as x approaches 1) of the power\nseries the to the sum of the original series. Note that the original series may be convergent or divergent.\nFor divergent series it is known as Abel\u2019s summation method. Obviously, if the original series is uniformly\nabsolutely-convergent then it is Abel summable.\nIn the following subsections, we study two power series associated with the zeta function: the polylogarithm and a power series associated with the numerical series of the previous section. The advantages of\nusing the second power series will be apparent in the rest of the paper since our interest is mainly directed\nto the non-trivial zeros which are known to reside in the critical strip.\n\n\n3.1 Parametrization of the Defining Series: The Polylogarithm Function\n\n\nThe most well-know and the earliest parametrization attached to the original definition of the Riemann zeta\nfunction (1.1) is the polylogarithm function, denoted by Li s (x). It is defined by the power series\n\n\n\nLi s (x) =\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nx [n]\n\n(3.1)\nn [s] [ .]\n\n\n\nThe definition is valid for all complex values s and all complex values of x such that |x| < 1 but the series\nis convergent for x = 1 only when Re(s) > 1.\nUsing the identity\n\n\n5\n\n\n1 1\nn [s] [ =] \u0393(s)\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ne [\u2212][nt] t [s][\u2212][1] dt, (3.2)\n\n\ufffd 0\n\n\n\nequation (3.1) can be rewritten as\n\n\n\nt [s][\u2212][1]\n\ne [t] \u2212 x [dt.] (3.3)\n\n\n\nx\nLi s (x) =\n\u0393(s)\n\n\n\n\ufffd 0\u221e\n\n\n\nThe integral in (3.3) is called Appell\u2019s integral or Jonqui`ere\u2019s integral. It defines Li s (x) not only in the\nunit circle but also in the whole slit plane C \\ [1, \u221e) provided that Re(s) > 0.\nBy a change of variable, u = e [\u2212][t], the polylogarithm function can be expressed as\n\n\n\n(\u2212 ln u) [s][\u2212][1]\n\n1 du, x \u0338= 0; Li s (0) = 0. (3.4)\nx [\u2212] [u]\n\n\n\n1\nLi s (x) =\n\u0393(s)\n\n\n\n\ufffd 01\n\n\n\nIn formula (3.4), the integral without the gamma factor is a a Cauchy-type singular integral. By putting\nw = [1] [x] [ 1]\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\nx [, we can deduce the local and global properties of Li] [s] [(][x][) = Li] [s] [(] [ 1] w\n\n\n\nw [). Indeed, the integral]\n\n\n\n1\n\u2126(w) =\n\ufffd 0\n\n\n\n(\u2212 ln u) [s][\u2212][1]\n\ndu, (3.5)\nw \u2212 u\n\n\n\nis a singular integral of Cauchy type with an absolutely integrable density function possessing a logarithmic singularity [8, p. 62]. Both the integrand and the integral are multi-valued. The function \u2126(w)\nvanishes at infinity, and is a holomorphic function in all the complex plane except possibly on the cut [0, 1]\nwhich constitutes a singular segment (i.e. a segment of discontinuity). But since the density (\u2212 ln u) [s][\u2212][1]\n\nis holomorphic in a neighborhood of [0, 1], the singular segment is not essential in the sense that the line\nintegral can be deformed into an equal curvilinear integral from 0 to 1, and the only truly singular points\nare 0 and 1. The function \u2126(w) is, however, not single-valued and possesses periods.\nGoing back to the polylogarithm, we conclude that Li s (x) is a holomorphic function in the x plane cut\nalong [1, \u221e) and that the only truly singular points are 1 and \u221e. Moreover, the polylogarithm is well-defined\nat 0. Let\u2019s denote the principal branch of Li s (x) by Li s (x) [\u22c6] ; that is the branch which is equal to the original\ndefining series of Li s (x) around x = 0 (sometimes called the holomorphic germ at 0). If we further denote by\nln(x) the principal branch of the logarithm (i.e. with a branch cut along the negative real axis), the general\nexpression of Li s (x) is given by\n\n\nLi s (x) = Li s (x) [\u22c6] \u00b1 [2][k\u03c0i] (3.6)\n\n\u0393(s) [(ln(][x][)][ \u00b1][ 2][m\u03c0i][)] [s][\u2212][1]\n\n\nif the integral (3.5) is taken a along a path which winds k times around x = 1 and m times around x = 0.\nThus, x = 0 is a singular point for all the branches of Li s (x) other than the principal branch.\nThe last expression also shows that the polylogarithm extends analytically to a global single-valued\nanalytic function if defined properly on a Riemann surface constructed using adequate pasting of copies of\nthe slit plane C [\u2217] = C \\ {(\u2212\u221e, 0] \u222a [1, \u221e)} and a copy of the main branch not split at x = 0 but with a cut\nalong [1, \u221e).\nAn alternative way of extending analytically the original defining series of Li s (x) is by use of the inversion\nformulas, also known as the Lerch-Jonqui`ere formulas:\n\n\nTheorem 3.1 (Lerch-Jonqui`ere formulas, [11, 20]). For all complex s, Li s (x) satisfies the two inversion\nformulas:\n\n\n6\n\n\n1. For complex x /\u2208 [0, 1]:\n\n\nLi s (x) + (\u22121) [s] Li s\n\n\n2.

For x /\u2208 [0, \u221e) and by taking ln(\u2212x) + \u03c0i = ln(x), the two expressions (3.7)-(3.8) agree because\nln(\u2212x) = \u2212 ln \ufffd\u2212 x [1] \ufffd, and we have\n\n\n\n.

The direct method is to use the Cauchy\ntype integral representations (3.4) or (3.5) of the polylogarithm in order to determine the local behavior of\nthe integrals near the endpoints of the contour of integration w = 0 and w = 1 (or x = \u221e and x = 1).\nFor the remaining sections of the paper, we need to know the behavior of Li s (x) near \u221e. So, we only\ndescribe the behavior around the lower point of the contour, i.e w = 0, the other endpoint is similar (for\ndetails see [8]).\nFor the special endpoint w = 0 (or x = \u221e) and concerning Li s (x), this has been carried out in [3] using\nintegration by parts and in [9] using Watson\u2019s lemma for loop integrals. The methods of [8] (see also the\nreferences therein) are of a different nature. They are more general and more systematic, and deal with\na wide variety of Cauchy type integrals using the Sokhotski-Plemelj formulas. When s is an integer, the\nCauchy type integral (3.5) can be expressed very elegantly and in finite form. But when s is not an integer,\nthe local expression of the integral cannot be given in finite form and thus does not offer any advantage over\nthe asymptotic behavior of Li s (x) given in [3] or [9]. [1]\n\nThe indirect way, and probably the easiest, to obtain an asymptotic the behavior of Li s (x) when x is\nlarge is to use the global ready-to-use Lerch-Jonqui`ere formulas of Theorem 3.1. They give the behavior for\nboth integer and fractional values of s at the expense of evaluating the asymptotic behavior of the hurwitz\nzeta function. We obtain the following\n\n\nCorollary 3.2.

In this section, we define an Abel type parametrized series associated with the\nuniformly absolutely-convergent series defined in section 2, and which is valid when Re(s) > 0.

Note that the exponent of the variable\nx is not n but n + 1 for reasons that will be apparent shortly. It can be easily seen from Lemma 2.2 that\nthe radius of absolute uniform convergence of the series (3.19) is 1.\nDefine\n\n\n\n\u03c6(s, x) =\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd S n (s)x [n] . (3.20)\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nSimilar to Z(s, x), the radius of convergence of \u03c6(s, x) is 1, and uniform absolute convergence follows easily\nby comparison: the series [\ufffd] [\u221e] n=1 [S] [n] [(][s][)][x] [n] [ clearly converges absolutely for every point in][ S][ \u00d7 {][x][ :][ |][x][|][ <][ 1][}][,]\nwhere S is any compact set of the s-plane.\nMoreover, within the circle of convergence Z(s, x) is an antiderivative of \u03c6(s, x), and we have\n\n\n\n\u03c6(s, t) dt.

For this purpose, let\u2019s further analyze the function \u03c6(s, x).\nThe integral in (3.26) provides the analytic continuation of \u03c6(s, x) to the whole x-plane save values of x\nfor which the integral is not defined, i.e. x\u2212x 1 \u2208/ [0, 1]; that is, when x /\u2208 [1, +\u221e). The integral expression\n\nalso shows that Li s \ufffd x\u2212x 1 \ufffd is a multi-valued function with the points 0, 1 and \u221e as the only branch point\nsingularities. The points 1 and \u221e are the only branch points of the principal branch which coincides with\nthe series \u03c6(s, x). The principal branch is single valued if the plane is cut along [1, +\u221e). The point x = 0\n\nx\nis however a singular point for all the other branches of Li s \ufffd x\u22121 \ufffd, and to make the function single valued,\n\nthe plane should be cut along (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u222a [1, \u221e). For ease of notation, and from now on, we refer to the cut\n\nx\nplane set C \\ {(\u2212\u221e, 0] \u222a [1, \u221e)} as C [\u2217], and we refer to \u03c6(s, x) by its analytic continuation Li s \ufffd x\u22121 \ufffd.\n\nThe next theorem expresses Z(s, x) in a form which differs from (3.28). The expression of Z(s, x) still\nuses the polylogarithm but it is rewritten as a sum of a constant term and a variable error term:\n\n\nTheorem 3.6. For x \u2208 C \\ {(\u2212\u221e, 0) \u222a (1, \u221e)}, we have\n\n\n\n1\nZ(s, x) = (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) + Li s\n\ufffd x\n\n\n\nz\n\ufffd z \u2212 1\n\n\n\ndz, (3.29)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nthe integral being taken along a finite continuous path in the x-cut plane C [\u2217] \u225c C \\ {(\u2212\u221e, 0] \u222a [1, \u221e)}, and\nwhere the error term satisfies\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nLi s\n\n\ufffd x\n\n\nas x \u2192 1, x \u2208 C \\ (1, \u221e).\n\n\n\nz\n\ufffd z \u2212 1\n\n\n\n\u22121 1 s\ndz \u223c \u2212 log, (3.30)\n\ufffd \u0393(1 + s) [(1][ \u2212] [x][)] \ufffd \ufffd x [\u2212] [1] \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\nProof.

But since the integrated series converges to 0 when x = 1, Abel\u2019s limit\ntheorem on the continuity of power series shows that the integral in (3.31) is well-defined. We next show\nthat the left hand side of (3.31) defines a global primitive in C [\u2217] .\nWe know that a global primitive exists as long as the integral depends only on the ordinary endpoints\nof an admissible path. By an admissible path we mean a continuous path of finite length with ordinary\nendpoints and such that it does not cross the cut (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u222a [1, \u221e). This is possible since C [\u2217] is a star-shaped\ndomain, hence it is arc-wise connected; that is, it is always possible that the initial and final points of\n\nx\nintegration remain on the same branch of Li s \ufffd x\u22121 \ufffd.\nBut in (3.31), one of the endpoints is singular and so the classical theorem on the existence of global\nprimitive needs to be extended to integrals with singular endpoints. This is possible since Cauchy-Goursat\ntheorem and primitive functions can be generalized to improper complex integrals provided that the involved\nintegrals are convergent [12, p. 261] and [15, Theorem 3.3 [\u2032], p. 89]. Therefore, the integral is well-defined for\nany x \u2208 C [\u2217] . It is also obviously well-defined for x = 0 and x = 1.\nTo prove the approximation of the error term, we first note that when x \u2208 C [\u2217], log \ufffd 1\u2212z z \ufffd = \u2212 log \ufffd 1\u2212z z \ufffd.\n\nWe then use the estimate of Corollary 3.2 which provides\n\n\n\n\u22121\n\n\u223c\n\ufffd \u0393(1 + s)\n\n\n\n1 s\n\u2212 log, (3.32)\n\ufffd \ufffd z [\u2212] [1] \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\nLi s\n\n\n\nz\n\ufffd z \u2212 1\n\n\n\nas z \u2192 1, z \u2208 C [\u2217] . Finally, since z is in a neighborhood of 1, we can lift the restriction on z near the\npoint 0, and the estimate is valid when z \u2208 C \\ (1, \u221e).\nTo complete the proof, we suppose, without loss of generality, that the integral is taken along a real path,\ni.e. x \u2208 (0, 1) since Li s \ufffd z\u2212z 1 \ufffd being analytic and single-valued in C \\ {(\u2212\u221e, 0] \u222a [1, \u221e)} Cauchy\u2019s theorem\npermits the deformation of the path to a new real path as long as x \u2192 1.

The trivial zeros which occur at all negative even integers s =\n\u22122, \u22124, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, and the nontrivial zeros which occur at certain values of s \u2208 C in the critical strip 0 < Re(s) < 1\nand whose existence in infinite number has been know for a long time. Since \u03b6(s) is an analytic function,\nthe nontrivial zeros must be isolated and each must have a finite multiplicity m. The multiplicity m of the\nnon-trivial zero is believed by many experts to be 1 but remains to this date unproved. Thus, if s 0 is a\nnon-trivial zero, there exists a neighborhood B \u03b4 (s 0 ), \u03b4 > 0 sufficiently small, such that s 0 is the unique zero\nin B \u03b4 (s 0 ).\nLet s 0 be one of the nontrivial zeros.

In a similar fashion, we can also define a ratio of\nparametrized zeta functions using the parametrized zeta function Z(s, x) defined by (3.19) in section 3. This\nis described next.\n\n\n4.1 Ratio of Parametrized Zeta Series\n\n\nIn this section, we will purposely dwell on the details because interchanging limits of functions of two\nvariables can be very delicate. Recall the Abel parametrization Z : B \u03b4 (s 0 ) \u00d7 (0, 1) \u2212\u2192 C of the uniformly\nabsolutely-convergent series for \u03b6(s) defined by\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\nZ(s, x) = \ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nS n (s)\n(4.5)\nn + 1 [x] [n][+1] [,]\n\n\n\nwhere B \u03b4 (s 0 ) is an open ball containing the only nontrivial zero s 0 . For fixed s, uniform-absolute\nconvergence with respect to x implies continuity at the boundary point x = 1:\n\n\n\nlim = Z(s, 1) =\nx\u21921 [Z][(][s, x][)]\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nS n (s)\n(4.6)\nn + 1 [= (][s][ \u2212] [1)][\u03b6][(][s][)][.]\n\n\n\nMoreover, by uniform-absolute convergence with respect to s the existence of the following repeated limit\nis immediate:\n\n\n\nlim = lim\ns\u2192s 0 x [lim] \u21921 [Z][(][s, x][)] s\u2192s 0\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nS n (s)\n(4.7)\nn + 1 [= (][s] [0] [ \u2212] [1)][\u03b6][(][s] [0] [)][.]\n\n\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nS n (s 0 )\n\n(4.8)\nn + 1 [= (][s] [0] [ \u2212] [1)][\u03b6][(][s] [0] [)][.]\n\n\n\nlim = lim\nx\u21921 s [lim] \u2192s 0 [Z][(][s, x][)] x\u21921\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nS n (s 0 )\n\nn + 1 [x] [n][+1] [ =]\n\n\n\nTherefore, from the parametrized series definition and for a non-trivial zero s 0, we always have\n\n\nlim (4.9)\ns\u2192s 0 x [lim] \u21921 [Z][(][s, x][) = lim] x\u21921 s [lim] \u2192s 0 [Z][(][s, x][) = (][s] [0] [ \u2212] [1)][\u03b6][(][s] [0] [) = 0][.]\n\n\n15\n\n\nThe same identity holds for 1 \u2212 s 0 which is also a zero of (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s). From these found identities, we\nnow deduce a similar identity for the ratio of zeta functions. Indeed, by the definition of limit of the ratio of\ntwo functions, we know that\n\n\n\nlim\nZ(s, x) x\u21921 [Z][(][s, x][)]\nlim =\nx\u21921 Z(1 \u2212 s, x) lim [Z][(1][ \u2212]\n\n\n\n\u2212s\u03b6(1 \u2212 s) (4.10)\n\n\n\n\n[s, x]\nx\u21921\n\nlim \u2212s\u03b6(1 \u2212 s)\nx\u21921 [Z][(1][ \u2212] [s, x][) = (][s][ \u2212] [1)][\u03b6][(][s][)]\n\n\n\nprovided the right hand side of (4.10) exists. For s \u0338= s 0, the right hand side obviously exists and is a\nfinite nonzero number. Moreover, from the discussion in the beginning of this section, the right hand side\nexists of (4.10) even for s = s 0 which is originally an indeterminate form and made determined using the\nfunctional equation. Therefore, with the absolute value being continuous, we get\n\n\n\ns 0 \u2212 1\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u2212s 0 R(s 0 )\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd .

Indeed, both the numerator and the denominator exist because of\n(4.8), and as a consequence of the functional equation, the ratio also exists.\nIn other words, for the parametrized uniformly absolutely convergent series of Z(s, x) defined by (4.5)\nand for any nontrivial zero s 0, we have the identity:\n\n\n\n= lim\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd x\u21921 s [lim] \u2192s 0\n\n\n\n0 \u2212 1\n\n\u2212s 0 R(s 0 )\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd .

The existence of the involved limits is the main reason for considering the absolute value of the\nquotient. Without absolute values, the limits may not exist for some particular values of s because the ratio\nis a complex-valued function.\nIdentity (4.14) should also hold if we rewrite Z(s, x) using a different analytic expression. Indeed, uniform\nabsolute-convergence implies uniform convergence, and absolute-convergence is independent of the ordering\nof a series. The parametrized series will remain uniformly convergent no matter how the order of the terms\nare changed or rearranged. Other expressions can for example be obtained by rearranging terms, power series\nexpansion around a regular point in the domain of analyticity, the sum of a regular part and a multi-valued\n(or principal) part, expansion in powers of log x etc. In the next section, we will make use of this fact using\nthe analytic expression (3.30) given in Theorem 3.6.\n\n\n4.2 The Riemann Hypothesis\n\n\nLet s 0 = \u03c3 0 + i\u03c9 0, 0 < Re(s 0 ) < 1 be a fixed nontrivial zero of \u03b6(s) and consider the parametrized zeta\nfunction Z(s 0, x) defined by the series (4.5). Theorem 3.6 permits to express the series as\n\n\n16\n\n\n1\nZ(s 0, x) = Li s 0\n\ufffd x\n\n\n\nz\n\ufffd z \u2212 1\n\n\n\ndz, (4.15)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nsince (s 0 \u2212 1)\u03b6(s 0 ) = 0. Replacing the last expression and the corresponding one for the zero 1 \u2212 s 0 into\nthe middle of equation (4.14) which asserts the existence and finiteness of the repeated limits, we get\n\n\n\nlim\nx\u21921\n\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd x \ufffd 1x1 [Li][Li] [1][\u2212][s] [0] [s] [0] \ufffd\ufffd z\u2212zz\u2212z1 1 \ufffd\ufffddzdz\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdR(s 0 ) s\u2212 0 \u2212s 0 1\n\n\n\n. (4.16)\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\nNow, using the asymptotic estimate (3.30) of Theorem 3.6, the last limit can rewritten as\n\n\n\n(1 \u2212 s 0 )\u0393(1 \u2212 s 0 )\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd s 0 \u0393(s 0 )\n\n\n\nlim\nx\u21921\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\n1 2\u03c3 0 \u22121 s 0 \u2212 1\n\nx [\u2212] [1] \ufffd\ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdR(s 0 ) \u2212s 0\n\n\n\n1\n\n\u2212\nlog\n\ufffd \ufffd x\n\n\n\n\u2212s 0\n\n\n\n. (4.17)\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\nThis limit always exists but its value depends of \u03c3 0 :\n\n\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\n\n\n0 if \u03c3 0 < 2 [1]\n\n1 if \u03c3 0 = [1] 2 (4.18)\n\n\u221e if \u03c3 0 - [1] 2 [.]\n\n\n\nlim\nx\u21921\n\n\n\n1 2\u03c3 0 \u22121\n\n\u2212 =\nlog\n\ufffd \ufffd x [\u2212] [1] \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\nHowever, for the limit to be consistent with (4.17) even if we switch the role of \u03b6(s) and \u03b6(1 \u2212 s) in the\nratio, \u03c3 0 has to be equal to 2 [1] [. This is nothing but the Riemann Hypothesis.]\n\n### 5 What About Other Zeta Series and Parametrizations?\n\n\nIn this section we examine whether any parametrization of the zeta function leads to the same results. The\n\u03b6(s)\nelementary argument used in the previous section is uniquely based on the fact that the ratio \u03b6(1\u2212s) [=][ R][(][s][)]\nis a continuous function of s and that it has a finite value at any non-trivial zero s 0 . Therefore, the reasoning\nshould be independent of the parametrization \u03b6(s) as long as the parametrized zeta function Z(s, x) possess\nsome specific properties. The properties of Z(s, x) that were used in the proof in the previous section are\nthe following:\n\n\nA1 Z(s, x) is a uniformly absolutely convergent parametrization of an absolutely uniformly convergent (in\nthe critical strip) series (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) of the form\n\n\n\n(s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) =\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd u(n, s), (5.1)\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nwhere u(n, s) is a well-defined holomorphic function whose restriction to the real numbers is real.\n\n\nA2 x = 1 is the unique finite singular point of Z(s, x).\n\n\nAssumption (A1) regarding uniform absolute-convergence is fundamental if we wish to conserve at least\npointwise and uniform convergence since any non-absolutely convergent series can potentially be reordered\ninto a non-uniformly convergent series, or a series which does not even converge pointwise. In addition, with\n(A1) lim\nx\u21921 [Z][(][s, x][) = (][s][ \u2212] [1)][\u03b6][(][s][) and][ u][(][n, s][) =][ u][(][n, s][) so that (][s][ \u2212] [1)][\u03b6][(][s][) is real when][ s][ is real.]\n\nAssumption (A2) is less fundamental but requiring it will eliminate series that are regular at x = 1\nsuch as Knopp\u2019s series above. When x = 1 is not singular, uninteresting conclusions will arise as we will\n\n\n17\n\n\nsee in another example at the end of this section (see Example 5.2). To simplify the analysis and to avoid\nunnecessary generalizations, we continue with Abel type parametrizations only:\n\n\n\nZ(s, x) =\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd u(n, s)x [n], (5.2)\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nWith such parametrizations, assumption (A1) can be easily checked and Assumption (A2) can for example\nbe satisfied using the general sufficient growth conditions considered by Lindel\u00a8of in [14, pp. 132]. In addition,\nwith (A2) and for fixed s, we must have\n\n\nu(n, s)\nlim (5.3)\nn\u2192\u221e u(n + 1, s) [= 1][.]\n\n\nThere exists other series than the series subject of this paper that analytically continue the original\nseries (1.1) to the whole complex plane. A summary of the relevant formulas associated with these series\n\n\u2212\n( 1) [n][\u2212][1]\nis illustrated in Table 2. Note that the Dirichlet eta function \u03b7(s) = (1 \u2212 2 [1][\u2212][s] )\u03b6(s) = [\ufffd] [\u221e] n=1 n [s] is not\n\nmentioned since it is not an absolutely convergent series when Re(s) < 1. Note also that the series in the\nthird row is very recent [1], and in the same paper, the author also proves that Hasse\u2019s and Ser\u2019s series are\na rearrangement of each other.\nAll the series of Table 2 are defined for all s \u2208 C and are uniformly and absolutely convergent series\non compact sets of the s plane. Moreover, the rate of convergence of the different series can be roughly\nestimated using the asymptotic order of growth of each particular term of the series, denoted by u n using\nthe asymptotic estimate of S n (s) proved in Section 2 and the estimates G n \u223c n(log1 n) [2] [ and][ C] [n] [ \u223c] log1 n [. The]\nnumbers G n, C n are known respectively as Gregory coefficients [2] and Cauchy numbers of the second kind.\nThe asymptotic estimates of these numbers can be easily deduced from the following generating functions\nof the G n and C n using the methods of [7]:\n\n\n\n1 1\nz [+] log(1 \u2212 z) [=]\n\n\n1\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\nz [\u2212] (1 \u2212 z) log(1 \u2212 z) [=]\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd G n z [n], (5.4)\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd C n z [n][\u2212][1] . (5.5)\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nWhen s is in the critical strip, the fastest converging series is Knopp\u2019s series, followed by Ser\u2019s series,\nfollowed by both hasse and Blagouchine\u2019s series which possess equal convergence rates, and followed lastly\nby this paper\u2019s series. Apart from Knopp\u2019s series whose Abel parametrization violates assumption (A2), the\npoint x = 1 is a singular point for all the remaining Abel parametrizations. The high convergence rate of\nSer\u2019s series, Hasse\u2019s series and Blagouchine\u2019s series did not allow the use the method of [4] which is essentially\nbased on the fact that the first derivative with respect to the parameter x of the parametrized series diverges\nat the critical point x = 1. That is, although not advantageous computationally, the slow convergence rate\nof this paper\u2019s series was in some respects very handy in [4].\nLet\u2019s now suppose that we have managed to express our parametrized zeta function (5.2) in a neighborhood of the singular point x = 1 by\n\n\nZ(s, x) = (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) + a(s)(x \u2212 1) [m][(][s][)] [1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ], (5.6)\n\n\nwhere a(s), m(s) are continuous functions of s, being real for s real [3] . Using the same arguments of the\n\n23 Gregory coefficients can also be expressed asNote that the reasoning does not only concern expansions of the form ( G n = n1! \ufffd 01 [t][(1][ \u2212] [t][)][ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7][ (] 5.6 [n][ \u2212] ) but also general expansions that contain algebraic [1][ \u2212] [t][)][ dt][.]\nand a finite number of nested logarithmic factors of the form\n\n\n\nm p (s)\n\n[1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ].\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n1\nZ(s, x) = (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) + a(s)(1 \u2212 x) [m] [0] [(][s][)] log\n\ufffd 1 \u2212 x\n\n\n18\n\n\n\nm 1 (s) 1\n\n       - \u00b7 \u00b7 log log . . . log\n\ufffd \ufffd 1 \u2212 x\n\n\nName Series Convergence Point\nRate x = 1\n\n\n\nKnopp[18] (1 \u2212 2 [1][\u2212][s] )\u03b6(s) =\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=0\n\n\n\n1 (log n) [s][\u2212][1]\n2 [n][+1] [ S] [n][+1] [(][s][)] u n \u223c 2 [n] n\u0393(s) regular\n\n\n\nn [2] \u0393(s) singular\n\n\n\n1\nSer[17] \u03b6(s) =\ns \u2212 1 [+]\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n(log n) [s][\u2212][3]\n\n\ufffd G n S n (s) u n \u223c n [2] \u0393(s)\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nHasse[10] (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) =\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=0\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\n1\nn + 1 [S] [n][+1] [(][s][ \u2212] [1)]\n\n\n1 (log n) [s][\u2212][2]\nn [S] [n] [(][s][ \u2212] [1)] u n \u223c n [2] \u0393(s\u22121) singular\n\n\n\nn [2] \u0393(s) singular\n\n\n\ns\nBlagouchine[1] \u03b6(s) =\ns \u2212 1 [\u2212]\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n(log n) [s][\u2212][2]\n\n\ufffd C n S [\u02dc] n (s) u n \u223c n [2] \u0393(s)\n\nn=1\n\n\n\nThis paper[4] (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) =\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\n1\nn + 1 [S] [n] [(][s][)]\n\n\n\n=\u2212\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=1\n\n\n\n1 (log n) [s][\u2212][1]\nn(n + 1) [\u2206] [n] [(][s][)] u n \u223c n(n+1)\u0393(s) singular\n\n\n\nTable 2: Abel ParametrizationS\u02dc n (s) = [\ufffd] k [n] =0 [\u2212][1] [(][\u2212][1)] [k] [\ufffd] [n][\u2212] k [1] \ufffd(k + 2) [\ufffd] [\u2212][\u221e] n=0 [s], \u2206 [u][(] n [n, s] (s) = [)][x] [n] [\ufffd][ of Different Series of] [n] k=1 \ufffd nk \ufffd(\u22121) [k] k [1][\u2212][s] and [ \u03b6][(][s] u [).] n [ S] \u225c [n] [(] u [s][) =] (n, s [ \ufffd] ). k [n] =0 [\u2212][1] [(][\u2212][1)] [k] [\ufffd] [n][\u2212] k [1] \ufffd(k+1) [\u2212][s],\n\n\nprevious section, we conclude that for a nontrivial zero s 0, we must have\n\n\n\na(s 0 )\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd a(1 \u2212 s 0 )\n\n\n\ns 0 \u2212 1\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u2212s 0 R(s 0 )\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd and (5.7)\n\n\n\nRe(m(s 0 )) = Re(m(1 \u2212 s 0 )).

Using the particular parametrization of the previous section, the\nsolution set of the two extra conditions was the critical line Re(s 0 ) = [1] 2 [which translates into the Riemann]\n\nHypothesis.\nTo solve (5.7)-(5.8) for a general parametrization, we start by narrowing the solution set. Firstly, note\nthat if m(s) (resp. a(s)) is a well-defined holomorphic function whose restriction to the real numbers is\nreal-valued, then m(s) = m(s) (resp. a(s) = a(s)). Secondly, we know that for all s 0 on the critical line\ns 0 = 1 \u2212 s 0 ; thus, the critical line is always part of the solution set defined by equations (5.7)-(5.8). This\nleads to the following question:\nQuestion: Do parametrized zeta functions satisfying (A1)-(A2) exist such that the whole critical line is\nonly part of a larger solution set imposed by conditions (5.7)-(5.8)?\nWe cannot answer such a question in its generality but we know that the answer is negative if we initially\nstart with a valid zeta series such as the one described in this paper. However, we can find artificially constructed parametrized zeta functions (not zeta series) which provide a positive answer to the above question.\nWe believe that such constructions [4] are not admissible in the sense that they do not originate from a globally\n(or at least in the critical strip) convergent series of \u03b6(s). We finish this section with three examples. The first\nexample depicts an artificially constructed parametrization, the second example illustrates a parametrization\nthat violates assumption (A2), and the third example reproduces the parametrization of [4].\n\n\n4 Note that all the artificial constructions have to satisfy the equality on the interchange of repeated limits.\n\n\n19\n\n\nExample 5.1. In this example, we have an artificial parametrization such that (5.7)-(5.8) have the critical\nline as a solution and other additional solutions off the critical line. Consider the following parametrized\nperturbation of \u03b6(s):\n\n\nZ(s, x) = (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) + (x \u2212 1) [s] [3] . (5.9)\n\n\nEquation (4.1) is trivially satisfied, and with s 0 = \u03c3 0 + i\u03c9 0, the solution to\n\n\nRe(s [3] 0 [) = Re((1][ \u2212] [s] [0] [)] [3] [)] (5.10)\n\n\nis the union of the vertical line \u03c3 0 = 2 [1] [and the curve in the (][\u03c3] [0] [, \u03c9] [0] [)-plane defined by]\n\n\n3\u03c9 0 [2] [=][ \u03c3] 0 [2] [\u2212] [\u03c3] [0] [ + 1][.] (5.11)\n\n\n\nThe curve is a vertical hyperbola centered at ( [1] 2\n\n\n\nThe curve is a vertical hyperbola centered at ( 2 [,][ 0). Such a parametrization contains an infinite number]\n\nof points off the critical line none of which are solutions to \u03b6(s) = 0.\nIn appearance this parametrization is useful. It tells that the non-trivial zeros of \u03b6(s) have to be either\non the hyperbola or on the critical line. It reduced the solution set of \u03b6(s) = 0 from a vertical strip to a\nunion of two segments of a hyperbola (the endpoints of the segments are (0, \u00b1 \u221a [1] 3 [) and (1][,][ \u00b1] [ 1] \u221a3 [)) and the]\n\n\n\n3 [) and (1][,][ \u00b1] [ 1] \u221a\n\n\n\nunion of two segments of a hyperbola (the endpoints of the segments are (0, \u00b1 \u221a3 [) and (1][,][ \u00b1] [ 1] \u221a3 [)) and the]\n\ncritical line. It has reduced the range of solutions of \u03b6(s) = 0.\nOne may be tempted to reproduce the proof of Section 4.2 using this parametrization. Indeed, the\ncritical line is already part of the set where the solutions of \u03b6(s) must reside. The other set consists of the\ntwo segments of the hyperbola. But since the first zeros of \u03b6(s) are at an algebraic height of \u00b114.13, the\ntwo segments of the hyperbola cannot contain any zero of \u03b6(s). In other words, such a parametrization\nwould imply the Riemann hypothesis. However, the attempted proof is untenable because we started with\na hypothetical artificial parametrization. There is no reason to parametrize \u03b6(s) in the form (5.9): it is not\nthe result of well-defined series of \u03b6(s). And, any conclusion is true if the starting premise is false.\n\n\nExample 5.2. In this example x = 1 is a regular point and assumption (A2) is violated. We have a\nparametrization where the range of search of the solution of \u03b6(s) = 0 is not reduced from the critical strip.\nLet Z(s, x) = (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s, x) be our parametrization, where \u03b6(s, x) is now the well-known Hurwitz zeta\nfunction. We use the power series expansion of \u03b6(s, x) around the point x = 0 given in [13]:\n\n\n\n\u03b6(s, a \u2212 t) =\n\n\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n\nn=0\n\n\n\n\u0393(s + n)\n\n(5.12)\n\u0393(s)n! [\u03b6][(][s][ +][ n, a][)][t] [n] [;][ |][t][|][ < a.]\n\n\n\nChoosing a = 1 and writing t = 1 \u2212 x leads to the desingularized expansion\n\n\n(s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s, x) = (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) + s(s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s + 1)(1 \u2212 x)[1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ]. (5.13)\n\n\n\nFor a nontrivial zero s 0 we must have\n\n\u03b6(s 0 + 1)\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u03b6(2 \u2212 s 0 )\n\n\n\ns 0 \u2212 1\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u2212s 0 R(s 0 )\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd . (5.14)\n\n\n\nThe exponent of x \u2212 1 in this expansion is 1 and equation (5.7) is trivially satisfied. Any non-trivial zero\nmust be a solution to equation (5.8). It is easy to verify that any complex number s 0 with real part equal to\n1\n2 [is a solution to (][5.8][). But are there other solutions to the same equation? We don\u2019t know. Hence, in some]\nsense, expansion (5.13) of the Hurwitz zeta function is not very interesting: it only provides the finiteness\n\n\u03b6(s 0 +1)\nof the ratio \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u03b6(2\u2212s 0 ) \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd which is useful in itself but does not give a qualitative characterization of the real part\n\nof s 0 . The same conclusion applies to the parametrization of Knopp\u2019s series in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\u03b6(s 0 +1)\nof the ratio \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u03b6(2\u2212s 0 )\n\n\n\n\u03b6(2\u2212s 0 )\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nExample 5.3. As a final example, we choose Z 1 (s, x) from [4] defined by [Z][(][s,x] x [)] : it is the parametrization\n\nof this paper but with the powers of x reduced by 1. Using a method very different from the method of this\npaper, the author obtained the following expansion [4]:\n\n\n\n1 log(1 \u2212 x)\nZ 1 (s, x) = (s \u2212 1)\u03b6(s) \u2212 \u0393(s + 1) [(1][ \u2212] [x][)] \ufffd \u2212x\n\n\nFor a nontrivial zero s 0, we must have\n\n\n\ns\n\n[1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ]. (5.15)\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\u0393(2 \u2212 s 0 )\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u0393(s 0 + 1)\n\n\n\ns 0 \u2212 1\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u2212s 0 R(s 0 )\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd and (5.16)\n\n\n\nRe(s 0 ) = Re(1 \u2212 s 0 ). (5.17)\n\n\nLike the parametrization (4.5), parametrization (5.15) is optimal in a sense that it helped us reduce the\nrange of solutions from the critical strip to the critical line.\n\n### 6 Conclusion\n\n\nWe showed the existence of a useful new parametrized uniformly globally convergent series of the Riemann\nzeta function. As an application of the new parametrized series, we derived necessary conditions for a nontrivial zero of \u03b6(s). These necessary conditions are of a qualitative rather than the usual quantitative type.\nThe Riemann hypothesis itself is of a qualitative character. By adding an extra parameter to the zeta\nfunction, information on the location of the zeros can be obtained without having to calculate these zeros.\nOther parametrizations of the zeta function may also be useful in determining other necessary conditions\nfor the non-trivial zeros. It is however important to start with a legitimate and admissible parametrization\nbecause artificially constructed parametrizations can be useless and may lead to the wrong conclusions. For\ninstance, further investigations of the known zeta series from Table 2 may lead to interesting results.\nFinally, it would be very useful and inspiring to apply and to extend the algorithm described in [19] in\norder to graphically analyze the behavior of the parametrized zeta function described in this paper.\n\n### References\n\n\n[1] I.
