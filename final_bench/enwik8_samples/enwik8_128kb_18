'''Agnostida''' (the '''agnostids''') is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[trilobite]]. These small trilobites first appeared toward the end of the lower [[Cambrian]] and thrived in the middle Cambrian. The last agnostids held out until the late [[Ordovician]]. 

The Agnostida are divided into two suborders -- [[Agnostina]] and [[Eodiscina]] -- that are then divided into a number of [[family (biology)|families]]. The Eodiscina appear to be &quot;normal&quot; trilobites with only two or three segments in the thorax; some resemble trilobites of the order [[Ptychopariida]]. As a group, agnostids have ''[[Pygidium|pygidia]]'' (tails) that are similar in size and shape to their ''[[cephalon]]s'' (heads). Neither looks much like the corresponding regions of other trilobites. There has been more than one argument about which end is the &quot;head&quot;. 

Agnostids were probably benthic (bottom-dwelling) creatures. Most agnostid species have no eyes. They likely lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on detritus that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom.

Unfortunately, the appendages are known only for one [[genus]] of agnostid. The legs of that genus look much more like [[crustacean]] legs than the legs of other trilobites with preserved appendages. This has caused many [[Taxonomy|taxonomist]]s to question whether the agnostids are truly trilobites. Another view is that the agnostids represent the first line to have diverged from the trilobites. However, four orders of trilobites ([[Redlichiida]], [[Corynexochida]], [[Naraoidia]], [[Ptychopariida]]) considerably predate the earliest Agnostids in the [[fossil]] record.

Agnostina are generally referred to simply as &quot;agnostids&quot; even though they probably should be called &quot;agnostines&quot;.

An '''abortion''' is the termination of a [[pregnancy]] associated with the death of an [[embryo]] or a [[fetus]]. This can occur spontaneously, in the form of a [[miscarriage]], or be intentionally induced through chemical, surgical, or other means. Generally, abortions are performed by [[gynaecology|gynaecologists]] or [[obstetrics|obstetricians]]. All [[Pregnancy (mammals)|mammalian pregnancies]] can be aborted; however, this article focuses exclusively on the abortion of [[human]] pregnancy.

There have been various methods of inducing an abortion [[History of abortion|throughout the centuries]]. In the [[20th century]], the [[ethics]] and [[morality]] of abortion became the subject of intense [[political]] [[debate]] in many areas of the world.

==Definitions==
[[Pregnancy]] is defined by the [[medicine|medical community]] as beginning at the [[implantation]] of the [[embryo]]. Others differ, however, placing this initiation at [[fertilisation|conception]]. The following medical terms are used to define an abortion:

* ''Spontaneous abortion ([[miscarriage]])'': An abortion due to accidental trauma or [[natural causes]].
*''Induced abortion'': An abortion deliberately caused. Induced abortions are further subcategorized into therapeutic abortions and elective abortions: 
**''Therapeutic abortion''
*** To save the life of the pregnant woman.  	 
*** To preserve the woman's physical or mental health. 	 
*** To terminate a pregnancy that would result in the birth of a child with defects which would be [[fatal|incompatible with life]] or associated with significant [[morbidity]]. 	 
*** To [[selective reduction|selectively reduce]] the number of [[fetus]]es in a [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancy]] to lessen health risks involved. 	 
**''Elective abortion'': An abortion performed for any other reason.

Methods of birth control that prevent implantation, such as [[emergency contraception]], are not considered to be abortion; however, emergency contraception is generally considered equivalent to abortion by those who reject the medical definition of pregnancy.

A pregnancy that ends earlier than 37 completed weeks of gestation, and where an [[infant]] is born and survives, is termed a [[premature birth]]. A pregnancy that ends with an infant dead upon birth at any gestational stage, due to causes including spontaneous abortion or complications during delivery, is termed a [[stillbirth]]. 

In common parlance, the term &quot;abortion&quot; is synonymous with induced abortion of a human fetus.

==Incidence==
The incidence of and reasons for induced abortion vary in regions in which abortion is generally permitted.

It has been estimated that the total number of induced abortions performed globally is approximately 46 million per year. 26 million of these are said to occur in [[abortion law|places in which abortion is legal]]; the other 20 million happen where it is illegal. Some countries, such as [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], experience a low rate of induced abortion, while others like [[Russia]] and [[Vietnam]] have a comparatively high rate. {{ref|incidence2}} 

A 1998 study aggregated data from studies in 27 countries on the reasons women seek to terminate their pregnancies. It concluded that common factors cited to have influenced the abortion decision were the desire to delay or end childbearing, concern over the interruption of [[employment|work]] or [[education]], issues of financial or relationship stability, and perceived immaturity. {{ref|incidence3}} In [[Finland]] and the  [[United States]], concern for the health risks posed by pregnancy in individual cases was not a factor commonly given, whereas in [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], and [[Kenya]] such a concern was found to be more prevalent. A 2004 study in which  [[United States|American]] women at [[abortion clinic|clinic]]s answered a [[questionnaire]] yielded similar results. {{ref|incidence4}}  

Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures, such as [[eugenics]], the stigmatization of [[disabled]] persons, preference for children of a specific [[sex]], disapproval of [[single parent|single motherhood]], insufficient economic support for [[family|families]], lack of access to or rejection of [[birth control|contraceptive]] methods, or efforts toward [[population control]] (such as [[China]]'s [[one-child policy]]). A combination of these factors can sometimes result in forced abortion, [[forced sterilization]], [[infanticide]], [[child abandonment]], or [[sex-selective abortion and infanticide]] — which is illegal in most countries, but difficult to stop. In many areas, especially in [[developing country|developing nations]] or where abortion is illegal, women sometimes resort to &quot;[[back-alley abortion|back-alley]]&quot; or [[self-induced abortion|self-induced]] procedures. The [[World Health Organization]] suggests that there are 19 million terminations annually which fit its criteria for an [[Abortion#Unsafe abortion|unsafe abortion]]. {{ref|unsafe1}} See [[Abortion#Social issues|social issues]] for more information on these subjects.

==Forms of abortion==

===Spontaneous abortion===
{{main|Miscarriage}}

&lt;!--improve me!--&gt;
Spontaneous abortions, generally referred to as miscarriages, occur when an embryo or fetus is lost due to natural causes. A miscarriage is spontaneous loss of the embryo or fetus before the 20th week of development. Spontaneous abortions after the 20th week are generally considered to be preterm deliveries. Most miscarriages occur very early in a pregnancy. Approximately 10-50% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman. {{ref|miscarriage1}}

The risk for spontaneous abortion is greater in those with a history of more than three previous (known) spontaneous abortions, those who have had a previous induced abortion, those with systemic diseases, and in women over age 35.  

Other causes can be infection (of either the woman or the fetus), immune responses, or serious systemic diseases of the woman. 

A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental [[trauma]]; intentional trauma to cause miscarriage is considered an induced abortion. Some governments have laws increasing the criminal liability of a person who causes a miscarriage during an [[assault]] or other violent [[crime]].

===Induced abortion===

A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in a number of ways. The manner selected depends chiefly upon the [[gestational age]] of the [[fetus]], in addition to the legality, regional availability, and/or doctor-patient preference for specific procedures.

====Surgical abortion====
[[Image:PBAsigning_wide.jpg|thumb|240px|right|U.S. President George W. Bush signs the ''Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003'']]

In the first fifteen weeks, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or vacuum abortion is the most common method. ''[[Manual vacuum aspiration]]'', or MVA abortion, consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] by suction using a manual [[syringe]], while the ''[[Electric vacuum aspiration]]'' or EVA abortion method uses an electric [[pump]]. These techniques are equivalent, differing only in the mechanism use to apply suction.  From the fifteenth week up until around the twenty-sixth week, a surgical [[dilation and evacuation]] (D &amp;amp; E) is used. D &amp;amp; E consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the [[uterus]] and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.

''[[Dilation and curettage]]'' (D &amp;amp; C) is a standard gynaecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion.  ''[[Curettage]]'' refers to the cleaning of the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this sort of procedure, also called Sharp Curettage, only when MVA is unavailable. {{ref|surgicalabortion1}} Sharp curettage only accounted for 2.4% of abortion procedures in the US in [[2002]]. {{ref|surgicalabortion2}} The term &quot;D and C&quot; can more generally be used to refer to the first trimester abortion procedure, irrespective of the method used to perform the procedure. 

Other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the third [[trimester]]. Premature delivery can be induced with [[prostaglandin]]; this can be coupled with injecting the [[amniotic sac|amniotic fluid]] with caustic solutions containing [[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[urea]]. Very late abortions can be brought about by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (intact D &amp;amp; X), which requires the surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation, and is sometimes termed &quot;[[partial-birth abortion]].&quot;  A [[hysterotomy abortion]], similar to a [[caesarian section]] but resulting in a terminated fetus, can also be used at late stages of pregnancy. It can be performed vaginally, with an incision just above the [[cervix]], in the late mid-trimester.

====Chemical abortion====
[[Image:Mifepristone.gif|thumb|right|170px|The molecular structure of the abortifacient drug Mifepristone.]]
{{main|Chemical abortion}}

Effective in the first trimester of pregnancy, chemical (also referred to as a medical abortion), or non-surgical abortions comprise 10% of all abortions in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. The process begins with the administration of either [[methotrexate]] or [[mifepristone]], followed by [[misoprostol]]. When appropriately used, 98% of women undergoing medical termination of pregnancy will experience completed abortion without surgical intervention. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] currently approves the use of mifepristone up to 49 days gestation (7 weeks), though evidence based regimens exist for its use up to 61 days gestation with similar success rates.  Misoprostol alone can also be used, though it is not FDA approved for this purpose.  Misoprostol (Cytotec) alone has the advantage of costing less than one dollar for an effective dose, as opposed to several hundred dollars for an effective dose of mifepristone.  In cases of failure of medical abortion, vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically.

====Other means of abortion====
Historically, a number of [[herb]]s reputed to possess [[abortifacient]] properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]: [[tansy]], [[pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[silphium]] (see [[Abortion#History of abortion|history of abortion]]). The use of herbs in such a manner can cause serious — even lethal — side effects, such as [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]], and is not recommended by [[physician]]s. {{ref|othermethods1}}

Abortion is sometimes attempted through means of trauma to the [[abdomen]]. The degree of force applied, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing [[miscarriage]]. {{ref|othermethods2}} Both accidental and deliberate abortions of this kind can be subject to criminal liability in many countries. In [[Myanmar|Burma]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Thailand]], there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal [[massage]]. {{ref|othermethods3}}

Reported methods of unsafe, [[self-induced abortion]] include the misuse of the [[ulcer]] [[drug]] [[Misoprostol]] and the insertion of non-surgical implements such as [[knitting needle]]s and [[clothes hanger]]s into the [[uterus]].

==Health effects==

&lt;!--MAJOR REORG NEEDED. Entire section is argumentative, and biased: See Talk. --&gt;
Early-term surgical abortion is a simple procedure, and when performed by competent doctors (and in some states, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and physician assistants) in first-world nations (before the 16th week), is safer than carrying the pregnancy to term. {{ref|healtheffects1}} &lt;!-- As I pointed out earlier, listing the negatives of this generally safe procedure first would be biased. --&gt;

As with most surgical procedures, the most common surgical abortion methods carry the risk of potentially serious complications. These risks include: a perforated uterus, perforated [[bowel]] or [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], [[septic shock]], sterility, and death. The risk of complications occurring can increase depending on how far the pregnancy has progressed, but may be counterbalanced by [[Complications of pregnancy|complications]] that would occur from carrying the pregnancy to term.

It is difficult to accurately assess the risks of induced abortion due to a number of factors. These factors include wide variation in the quality of abortion services in different [[Society|societies]] and among different [[socio-economic]] groups, a lack of uniform [[definition]]s of terms, and difficulties in patient follow-up and after-care. The degree of risk is also dependent upon the skill and experience of the practitioner; maternal age, health, and [[parity]]; [[gestational age]]; pre-existing conditions; methods and instruments used; [[medication]]s used; the skill and experience of those assisting the practitioner; and the quality of recovery and follow-up care. A highly-skilled practitioner, operating under ideal conditions, will tend to have a very low rate of complications; an inexperienced practitioner in an ill-equipped and ill-staffed facility, on the other hand, will often have a higher incidence of complications.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the number of deaths due to legal abortion between the years of 1991 and 1993 was 5, as compared to the 9 deaths caused by [[ectopic pregnancy]] during the same time frame. {{ref|mortality1}} In the [[United States]], during the year 1999, there were a total of 4 deaths due to legal abortion. {{ref|mortality2}} &lt;!--need to compare the number of abortions and the number of pregnancies for these numbers to relate --&gt;

Some practitioners advocate using minimal [[anesthesia]] so that the patient can alert them to possible complications. Others recommend [[general anesthesia]], in order to prevent patient movement, which might cause a perforation. General anesthesia carries its own risks, including death, which is why public health officials recommend against its routine use.

[[Dilation]] of the [[cervix]] carries the risk of cervical tears or perforations, including small tears that might not be apparent and might cause [[cervical incompetence]] in future pregnancies. Most practitioners recommend using the smallest possible dilators, and using [[osmotic]] rather than [[mechanical]] dilators after the first [[trimester]] of pregnancy. 

Instruments are placed within the uterus to remove the fetus. These can, on rare occasions, cause [[perforation]] or [[laceration]] of the uterus, and damage to structures surrounding the uterus. Laceration or perforation of the uterus or cervix can, again on rare occasions, lead to even more serious complications.

Incomplete emptying of the uterus can cause [[hemorrhage]] and infection. Use of [[ultrasound]] verification of the location and duration of the pregnancy prior to abortion, with immediate follow-up of patients reporting continuing pregnancy symptoms after the procedure, will virtually eliminate this risk. The sooner a complication is noted and properly treated, the lower the risk of permanent injury or death. 

In rare cases, the abortion will be unsuccessful and the pregnancy will continue. An unsuccessful abortion can also result in the delivery of a live [[neonate]], or infant. This, termed a failed abortion, is more likely to occur if the procedure is carried out later in the pregnancy. Some doctors faced with this situation have voiced concerns about the ethical and legal ramifications of then letting the neonate die. As a result, recent investigations have been launched in the [[United Kingdom]] by the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in order to determine how widespread the problem is and what an ethical response in the treatment of the infant might be. {{ref|failed}}

Use of other methods (e.g., overdose of various drugs, insertion of various objects into [[uterus]]) for abortion is potentially dangerous, carrying a significantly elevated risk for permanent injury or death compared to abortions done by [[physician]]s. 

===Suggested effects===
There is controversy over a number of proposed risks and effects of abortion. Evidence, whether in support of or against such claims, might in part be influenced by the political and religious beliefs of the parties behind it.

====Breast cancer====
{{main|Abortion-breast cancer hypothesis}}

The ''abortion-breast cancer (ABC) hypothesis'' posits a [[causality| causal relationship]] between having an induced abortion and a higher risk of developing [[breast cancer]] in the future. An increased level of [[estrogen]] in early [[pregnancy]] helps to initiate [[cellular differentiation]] (growth) in the [[breast]] in preparation for [[lactation]]. If this process is terminated, through abortion, before full differentiation in the third [[trimester]], then more &quot;vulnerable&quot; undifferentiated cells will be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. It is proposed that this might result in an elevated risk of [[breast cancer]]. The majority of interview-based studies have indicated a link, and some have been demonstrated to be [[statistically significant]], {{ref|abc1}} but there remains debate as to their reliability because of possible [[response bias]].

Larger and more recent record-based studies, such as one in 1997 which used data from two national [[registry|registries]] in [[Denmark]], found the correlation to be negligible to non-existent after statistical adjustment. {{ref|abc2}} The [[National Cancer Institute]] conducted an official workshop with dozens of experts on the issue, between [[February 24]]-[[February 26]], [[2003]], which concluded from its examination of various evidence that it is &quot;well established&quot; that &quot;induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.&quot; {{ref|abc3}}  These findings and how the Denmark study statistically adjusted their overall results have been disputed by [[Joel Brind|Dr. Joel Brind]], {{ref|abc4}} an invitee to the workshop and the leading scientific advocate of the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis. Nevertheless, gaps and inconsistencies remain in the research, and the subject continues to be one of political and scientific contention.

====Fetal pain====
{{main|Fetal pain}}

The experience of the fetus during abortion is a matter of medical, ethical and public policy concern.  Evidence is conflicting, with some authorities holding that the fetus is capable of feeling pain from the first [[trimester]], and others maintaining that the neuro-anatomical requirements for such experience do not exist until the second or third trimester.

[[Pain|Pain receptors]] begin to appear in the seventh week of pregnancy. The [[thalamus]], the part of the brain which receives signals from the [[nervous system]] and then relays them to the [[cerebral cortex]], starts to form in the fifth week. However, other anatomical structures involved in the [[pain|nociceptic]] process are not present until much later in gestation. Links between the thalamus and cerebral cortex aren't forged until around the 23rd week. {{ref|pain1}}

Researchers have observed changes in the heart rates and [[hormones| hormonal levels]] of newborn [[infants]] after [[circumcision]], [[blood tests]], and surgery — effects which were alleviated with the administration of [[anesthesia]]. {{ref|pain2}} Others suggest that the human experience of pain, being more than just physiological, cannot be measured in such [[reflexive]] responses.

====Mental health====
Some women will experience negative feelings as a result of elective abortion. However, whether this phenomenon is significant enough to warrant a general diagnosis, or even classification as an independent syndrome (see [[post-abortion syndrome]]), is a subject that is debated among members of the medical community.

Data on the incidence of [[clinical depression]], [[mental illness]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], and suicide in association with abortion remain inconclusive. {{ref|mental1}} A comparative analysis of the suicide rates among [[postnatal| postpartum]] and post-abortive women in [[Finland]] found a [[statistics| statistical]] correlation between abortion and suicide. {{ref|mental2}}

Other studies have suggested a link between the elective termination of an unwanted [[pregnancy]] and an improvement in reported mental well-being. {{ref|mental3}} Elective abortion may reduce the occurrence of depression in cases of unwanted pregnancy, as compared to cases in which the pregnancy has been carried to completion, but it is also sometimes reported as an additional [[stressor]] ([[ibid.]]). The majority of evidence would seem to indicate that adverse emotional reactions to the procedure are most strongly influenced by pre-existing [[psychology| psychological]] conditions and other negative factors ([[ibid.]]). 

Spontaneous abortion, or [[miscarriage]], is known to present an increased risk of [[depression]] in women. {{ref|mental4}}

==History of abortion==
{{main|History of abortion}}

[[Image:TansyPills.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Bottom-most: &quot;Dr. Caton's Tansy Pills!&quot; An example of a clandestine  advertisement.]]

The practice of induced abortion, according to some [[anthropologists]], can be traced to ancient times. There is evidence to suggest that, historically, pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of [[abortifacient]] herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques.

[[Soranus]], a 2nd century [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[physician]], suggested in his work ''[[Gynecology]]'' that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in violent exercise, energetic jumping, carrying heavy objects, and riding animals. He also prescribed a number of recipes for herbal bathes, [[pessary| pessaries]], and [[bloodletting]], but advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage due to the risk of organ [[perforation]]. {{ref|history1}} It is also known that the ancient Greeks relied upon the herb [[silphium]] as both a [[contraceptive]] and an [[abortifacient]]. The plant, as the chief export of [[Cyrene]], was driven to [[extinction]], but it is suggested that it might have possessed the same abortive properties as some of its closest extant relatives in the [[Apiaceae|Apiaceae family]].

Such folk remedies, however, varied in effectiveness and were not without risk. [[Tansy]] and [[pennyroyal]], for example, are two [[poison|poisonous]] [[herbs]] with serious [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that have at times been used to terminate pregnancy.

[[19th-century]] [[medicine]] saw advances in the fields of [[surgery]], [[anaesthesia]], and [[sanitation]], in the same era that doctors with the [[American Medical Association]] lobbied for bans on abortion in [[The United States]] and the [[British Parliament]] passed the Offences Against the Person Act. Demand for the procedure continued, however, as the disguised, but nonetheless open, advertisement of abortion services in Victorian times would seem to suggest. {{ref|history2}}

==Social issues==
A number of of complex issues exist in the debate over abortion. These, like the suggested effects upon health listed above, are a focus of research and a fixture of discussion among members on all sides the controversy.

===Effect upon crime rate===
{{Main|legalized abortion and crime effect}}

A controversial theory attempts to draw a [[correlation]] between the unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall [[crime rate]] witnessed in the [[United States]] during the 1990s and the decriminalization of abortion 20 years prior.

The suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a 1999 [[academic paper]], ''[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]]'', authored by the [[economist]]s [[Steven Levitt| Steven D. Levitt]] and [[John Donohue]]. They attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are [[African-American]], [[poverty| impoverished]], [[teenage pregnancy|adolescent]], [[education|uneducated]], and [[single parent|single]]. The change coincided with what would've been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier and that those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions. {{ref|crimerate1}} 

Fellow economists [[Christopher Foote]] and [[Christopher Goetz]] criticized the [[methodology]] in the Donahue-Levitt study, noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as [[cocaine]] use, and recalculating based on incidence of crime [[per capita]]; they found no [[statistically significant|statistically significant]] results. {{ref|crimerate2}} Levitt and Donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted [[data set]] which took into account these concerns but, they claim, maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper. {{ref|crimerate3}}

Such research has been criticized by some as being [[utilitarian]], [[discrimination|discriminatory]] as to [[race]] and [[social class|socioeconomic class]], and as promoting [[eugenic]]s as a solution to [[crime]]. {{ref|crimerate4}} {{ref|crimerate5}} Levitt states in his book, ''[[Freakonomics]]'', that they are neither promoting nor negating any course of action &amp;ndash; merely reporting data as economists.

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|sex-selective abortion and infanticide}}

The advent of both [[ultrasound]] and [[amniocentesis]] has allowed [[parent]]s to determine [[sex]] before [[childbirth|birth]]. This has lead to the occurrence of [[sex-selective abortion and infanticide|sex-selective abortion]] or the targeted termination of a [[fetus]] based upon its gender.

It is suggested that sex-selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the [[birth rate]]s of [[male]] and [[female]] children in some places. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of [[Asia]], and the use of abortion to limit female births has been reported in [[Mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], and [[India]]. {{ref|sexselective1}}

In [[India]], the [[economic]] role of [[men]], the costs associated with [[dowry| dowries]], and a [[Hindu]] tradition which dictates that [[funeral|funeral rites]] must be performed by a male relative have lead to a [[culture| cultural]] preference for [[son]]s. {{ref|sexselective2}}  The widespread availability of diagnostic testing, during the 1970s and '80s, lead to advertisements for services which read, &quot;Invest 500 [[rupee]]s [for a sex test] now, save 50,000 rupees [for a dowry] later.&quot; {{ref|sexselective3}} In 1991, the male-to-female [[sex ratio]] in India was skewed from its biological norm of 105 to 100, to an average of 108 to 100. {{ref|sexselective4}} Researchers have asserted that between 1985 and 2005 as many as 10 million female fetuses may have been selectively aborted. {{ref|india1}} The Indian government passed an official ban of pre-natal sex screening in 1994 and moved to pass a complete ban of sex-selective abortion in 2002. {{ref|sexselective5}}

In the [[People's Republic of China]], there is also a historic son preference. The implementation of the [[one-child policy]] in 1979, in response to population concerns, lead to an increased disparities in the sex ratio as parents attempted to circumvent the law through sex-selective abortion or the abandonment of unwanted [[daughter]]s. {{ref|sexselective6}} Sex-selective abortion might be a part of what is behind the shift from the baseline male-to-female birth rate to an elevated national rate of 117:100 reported in 2002.  The trend was more pronounced in rural regions: as high as 130:100 in [[Guangdong]] and 135:100 in [[Hainan]]. {{ref|sexselective7}} A ban upon the practice of sex-selective abortion was enacted in 2003. {{ref|sexselective8}}

===Unsafe abortion===
{{main|Unsafe abortions}}

Where and when access to safe abortion has been barred, due to explicit sanctions or general unavailability, women seeking to terminate their pregnancies have sometimes resorted to unsafe methods.

&quot;[[Back-alley abortion]]&quot; is a [[slang]] term for any abortion not practiced under ideal conditions of [[sanitation]] and [[professional| professionalism]]. The [[World Health Organization]] defines an unsafe abortion as being, &quot;a procedure...carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both.&quot; {{ref|unsafe1}} This can include a person without medical training, a professional health provider operating in sub-standard conditions, or the woman herself. 

Unsafe abortion remains a [[public health]] concern today due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications, such as incomplete abortion, [[sepsis]], [[hemorrhage]], and damage to internal organs. WHO estimates that 19 million unsafe abortions occur around the world annually and that 68,000 of these result in the death of a woman. {{ref|unsafe1}} Complications of unsafe abortion are said to account, globally, for approximately 13% of all [[maternal death|maternal mortalities]], with regional estimates including 12% in [[Asia]], 25% in [[Latin America]], and 13% in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. {{ref|unsafe2}} [[Health education]], access to [[family planning]], and improvements in [[healthcare]] during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon. {{ref|unsafe3}}

==Abortion debate==
[[Image:Prolife-DC.JPG|thumb|right|240px||Pro-life activists in Washington, DC stage a silent demonstration before the Supreme Court.]]
{{main|abortion debate}}

Over the course of the [[history of abortion]], induced abortions have been a source of considerable [[debate]] and [[controversy]] regarding the morality and legality of this practice. An individual's position on the complex [[ethical]], [[moral]], [[philosophical]], [[biological]], and [[legal]] issues have a strong relationship with that individual's [[value system]]. A person's position on abortion may be best described as a combination of their personal beliefs on the morality of abortion, and that person's beliefs on the ethical scope and responsibility of legitimate [[government|governmental]] and legal [[authority]]. Another factor for many individuals is [[religion|religious]] doctrine (see [[religion and abortion]]).

Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by [[advocacy|advocacy groups]] belonging to one of two camps. Most often those in favor of legal prohibition of abortion describe themselves as [[pro-life]] while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as [[pro-choice]].  Both are used to indicate the central principles in arguments for and against abortion:  &quot;Is the fetus a human being with a fundamental right to ''life''?&quot; for pro-life advocates, and, for those who are pro-choice, &quot;Does a woman have the right to ''choose'' whether or not to have an abortion?&quot;

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of [[laws]] permitting or restricting abortion. Arguments on morality and legality tend to collide and combine, complicating the issue at hand.

Debate also focuses on whether the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman should have to notify and/or have the [[consent]] of others in distinct cases: a [[minor (law)|minor]] her parents; a [[marriage|legally-married]] or [[common-law marriage|common-law]] wife her husband; or a pregnant woman the biological father.  In a 2003 [[Gallup]] poll in the [[United States]], 72% of respondents were in favor of spousal notification, with 26% opposed; of those polled, 79% of males and 67% of females responded in favor. {{ref|abortiondebate1}}

===Public opinion===
Political sides have largely been divided into [[moral absolutism|absolutes]]. The abortion debate, as such, tends to center around individuals who hold strong positions. However, public opinion varies from poll to poll, country to country, and region to region:

*'''Australia''': In a February 2005 [[AC Nielsen]] poll, as reported in [[The Age]], 56% thought the [[Abortion in Australia|current abortion laws]], which generally allow abortion for the sake of life or health, were &quot;about right,&quot; 16% want changes in law to make abortion &quot;more accessible,&quot; and 17% want changes to make it &quot;less accessible.&quot; {{ref|publicopinion1}} A 1998 poll, conducted by Roy Morgan Research, asked, &quot;Do you approve of the termination of unwanted pregnancies through surgical abortion?&quot; 65% of the [[Australia| Australians]] polled stated that they approved of surgical abortion and 25% stated that they disapproved of it. {{ref|publicopinion2}}

* '''Canada''': A recent poll of [[Canadians]], conducted in April 2005 by [[Gallup]], found that  52% of those polled want abortion laws to &quot;remain the same,&quot; 20% want the laws to be &quot;less strict,&quot; and 24% would prefer that the laws become &quot;more strict.&quot; An earlier Gallup poll, from December 2001, asked, &quot;Do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances or illegal in all circumstances and in what circumstances?&quot; 32% of Canadians responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all circumstance, 52% that it should be legal in certain circumstances, and 14% that it should be legal in no circumstances. See [[Abortion in Canada]].

*'''Ireland''': A 1997 [[Irish Times]]/MRBI poll of the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland's]] electorate found that 18% believe that abortion should never be permitted, 35% that one should be allowed in the event that the woman's life is threatened, 18% if her health is at risk, 28% that &quot;an abortion should be provided to those who need it,&quot; and 5% were undecided. {{ref|publicopinion3}}

* '''The United Kingdom''': An online [[YouGov]]/[[Daily Telegraph]] poll in August 2005 found that 30% of [[The United Kingdom| Britons]] would back a measure to reduce the legal limit for abortion to 20 weeks, 19% support a limit of 12 weeks, 9% support a limit of less than 12 weeks, and 25% support maintaining the current limit of 24 weeks. 6% responded that abortion should never be allowed while 2% said it should be permitted throughout the entirety of pregnancy. {{ref|publicopinion4}}

* '''The United States''': In a January 2006 [[CBS News]] poll, which asked, &quot;What is your personal feeling about abortion?&quot;, 27% said that abortion should be &quot;permitted in all cases,&quot; 15% that it should be &quot;permitted, but subject to greater restrictions than it is now,&quot; 33% that it should be &quot;permitted only in cases such as rape, incest or to save the woman's life,&quot; 17% that it should &quot;only be permitted to save the woman's life,&quot; and 5% that it should &quot;never&quot; be permitted. {{ref|publicopinion5}} A November 2005 [[Pew Research Center]] poll asked &quot;In 1973 the Roe versus Wade decision established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, at least in the first three months of pregnancy. Would you like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe versus Wade decision, or not?&quot;, with 29% indicating they want it overturned, and 65% that they do not. {{ref|publicopinion6}}

==Abortion law==
{{main|Abortion law}}

[[Image:AbortionLawsMap.png|thumb|250px|right|International status of abortion law]]
The [[Soviet Union]] (1920) and [[Iceland]] (1935) were some of the first countries to generally allow abortion. The second half of the twentieth century saw the liberalization of abortion laws in many other countries. In 1973, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] struck down state laws banning abortion, ruling that such laws violated an inferred [[right to privacy]] in the [[U.S. Constitution]].  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]], similarly, discarded its criminal code regarding abortion in 1988, after ruling that such restrictions violated the security of person guaranteed to women under in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in the case of [[R. v. Morgentaler]].  Canada later struck down provincial regulations of abortion in the case of [[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)]].  [[Ireland]], on the other hand, added an [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland| amendment]] to its [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] in 1983 by popular referendum, recognizing &quot;the right to life of the unborn&quot; (see [[Abortion in Ireland]]).

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The [[right to life]], the right to [[liberty]], and the right to [[security of person]] are major issues of [[human rights]] that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or the absence of laws controlling abortion. Many countries in which abortion is legal require that certain criteria be met in order for an abortion to be obtained, often, but not always, using a [[trimester]]-based system to regulate the window in which abortion is still legal to perform:

* In the [[United States]], some states impose a 24-hour waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[fetal development]], or require that parents be contacted if their [[Minor (law)|minor]] daughter requests an abortion.
* In the [[United Kingdom]], as in some other countries, two doctors must first certify that an abortion is medically or socially necessary before it can be performed.
Other countries, in which abortion is illegal, will allow one to be performed in the case of [[rape]], [[incest]], or danger to the pregnant woman's life or health. A handful of nations ban abortion entirely, such as [[Chile]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Malta]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[law]], an '''abstract''' is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long [[legal document]] or of several related legal papers.

==Abstraction of Title==

The Abstraction of Title, used in [[real estate]] transactions, is the more common form of abstract. An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. The abstract also records all [[deed]]s, [[will (law)|wills]], [[mortgage]]s, and other documents that affect [[ownership]] of the property. An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.

==Clear Title==

A Clear Title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaks in the chain of legal ownership. After the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. In a few states, a more efficient system of insuring title real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. After this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.

== Patent law ==

In the context of [[patent]] law and specifically in [[prior art]] searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step]] (or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obviousness]] in [[United States]] patent law) of an invention.

An '''AOLamer''' or AOL Lamer is a person using [[AOL]] that posts [[flamebait]] or other [[off-topic]] [[message]]s in a [[newsgroup]] in order to disrupt the newsgroup.

During the early 1990s, many regular non-AOL internet newsgroup users routinely killed all messages coming from AOL as many of the messages coming from AOL were non-informative.

In addition, the term '''AOLamer''' is often used as a derogatory term for AOL subscribers by users of other internet service providers, who view AOL as a provider associated with people who know little about computers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Hawkeyepierce.gif|thumb|200px|right|Alan Alda as Benjamin Franklin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce]]
'''Alan Alda''' (born [[January 28]], [[1936]] as '''Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo''') is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[writer]], [[film director|director]] and sometimes [[politics|political]] activist.  

He is most famous for his role as [[Hawkeye Pierce]] in the [[television]] series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. In the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]] he was viewed as the archetypal &quot;sensitive male&quot;, though in recent years he has appeared in roles which counter that image. 

==Family and early life==
Alda was born in [[New York City]]. His [[Italian American|Italian-American]] father, [[Robert Alda]] (born Alphonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo), was a successful actor, and his mother [[Joan Brown]] was crowned &quot;Miss New York&quot; in a [[beauty pageant]]. The adopted surname &quot;Alda&quot; is a contraction of &quot;'''AL'''phonso&quot; and &quot;'''D'A'''bruzzo&quot;.

When Alan Alda was growing up, his parents divorced.

Alan Alda contracted [[polio]] when he was seven years old, which kept him bedridden for two years as he received treatments.

Alan Alda's half-brother, [[Anthony Alda]] was christened '''Antonio D'Abruzzo''' on the 9th of [[December]] [[1956]].

He received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Fordham University]] in [[1956]]. During his junior year, he studied in [[Europe]] where he acted in a play in [[Rome]] and performed with his father on television in [[Amsterdam]]. After graduation, he joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army Reserve]] and served a six-month tour of duty as a gunnery officer in Korea following the [[Korean War]]. A year after graduation, he married Arlene Weiss, with whom he has three daughters: Eve, Elizabeth and Beatrice. [[Arlene Alda]] is a well known photographer, author and clarinettist.

Raised as a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], he has since left the church but continues to celebrate religious holidays and events. His specific religious beliefs are difficult to define.

He is also an activist for [[feminism|feminist]] causes, and has been for many years.

==Acting career, fame, and ''M*A*S*H''==
Alda began his career in the [[1950s]] as a member of the [[Compass Players]] comedy revue.

In the eleven years (72-83) he starred in ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', he was nominated for 21 [[Emmy Awards]] winning five. He wrote (or co-wrote) twenty episodes, and directed thirty episodes.  When he won his first Emmy Award for writing, he was so happy that he performed a [[cartwheel]] before running up to the stage to accept the award. He also was the first person to win Emmy Awards for acting, writing, and directing for the same series.  Interestingly enough, the late [[H. Richard Hornberger|Richard Hooker]], who wrote the novel on which ''M*A*S*H'' was based, did not like Alan Alda's portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce (Hooker had based Hawkeye on himself), though Hooker didn't care for the show in general.

==After ''M*A*S*H''==
Alda's prominence in the enormously successful ''M*A*S*H'' gave him a platform to speak out on political topics, and he has been a strong and vocal supporter of [[women's rights]]. As such, he has been something of a [[boogeyman]] for some political [[social conservative]]s who disagree with his views.

He has also appeared in at least two TV commercials.  Both of these were in the small-computer industry, first for [[Atari]] and later, with the rest of the ''M*A*S*H'' cast, for [[International Business Machines|IBM]]'s [[PS/2]] product line with [[Micro Channel architecture|MicroChannel architecture]].

[[Image:Alan_Alda.jpg|thumb|left|Alan Alda as Senator Vinick.]]
Alan Alda has also played [[Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist [[Richard Feynman]] in the play [[QED (play)|''QED'']], which has only one other character. Although [[Peter Parnell]] wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of [[Woody Allen]], and he has been a guest star five times on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', playing Dr. Gabriel Lawrence.

As of [[2004 in television|2004]], Alda is a regular cast member on the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] program ''[[The West Wing (television)|The West Wing]]'', portraying [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and presidential hopeful [[Arnold Vinick]]. He made his premiere in the sixth season's tenth episode, &quot;In The Room&quot;, and was added to the opening credits with the thirteenth episode, &quot;King Corn.&quot;

Throughout his career, he has been nominated for the Emmy Award 31 times and the [[Tony Award]] twice, and has won seven [[People's Choice Award]]s, six [[Golden Globe]] awards, and three [[Director's Guild of America]] awards.  However, it was not until [[2004]], after a long acting career, that Alda received his first nomination for an Academy Award.  This was the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] nomination for his role as Senator [[Ralph Owen Brewster]] in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[The Aviator]]''. 

In the spring of 2005, Alda starred as Shelly Levene in the Tony Award-winning Broadway revival of [[David Mamet]]'s ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]],'' for which he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play.

It has become quite normal for Alda in his later roles to have some reference to his early work in ''M*A*S*H''. For instance, both the senator he played in ''The Aviator'' and Hawkeye Pierce came from [[Maine]]. In a line on ''ER'', his character mentions that he uses a surgical technique he picked up in a &quot;military hospital&quot;. The same character also undergoes a mental acuity test where he has to identify pictures of objects. He sees a funnel and identifies it as a martini glass without the base (Hawkeye Pierce was very fond of martinis).  Alda's ''West Wing'' character has also made at least one reference to [[Korea]] when he said, &quot;I could take these people to the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] and it still wouldn't take their minds off ethanol and abortion&quot;).

In 2005, Alda published his first round of memoirs, ''Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I've Learned'', published by [[Random House]] (ISBN 1400064090). Among other stories, he recalls his [[intestine]]s becoming strangulated while on location in [[Chile]] for his PBS show ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]''. He also talks about his mother's battle with [[schizophrenia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- NOTE  TO EDITORS -- Remember, this is an *introductory* article to American football. It exists to give people who know little or nothing about the sport a basic understanding of the game. Information that does not fall under that description should go under [[American-football strategy]], [[American football rules]], etc. --&gt;
[[Image:Wilson American football.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The ball used in American football has a pointed [[oval]] or [[vesica piscis]] shape, and usually has a large set of stitches along one side.]]

'''American football''', known in the [[United States]] &lt;!--but not Canada; what they call &quot;football&quot;is actually the similar (but NOT identical) sport of Canadian football--&gt; simply as '''football''', is a competitive team [[sport]]. The object of the game is to advance the football towards the opposing team's [[end zone]] and score points. The ball can be advanced by carrying the ball, or by throwing or handing it from one teammate to the other. Points can be scored in a variety of ways, including carrying the ball over the goal line, throwing the ball to another player past the goal line or [[placekicker|kicking]] it through the goal posts. The winner is the team with the most points when the time expires.

Outside of the [[United States]] and a few other countries such as [[American Samoa]], the sport is usually referred to as ''American football'' (or sometimes as [[gridiron]]) to differentiate it from other football games, especially [[football (soccer)|association football (soccer)]] and [[rugby football]]. American football evolved as a separate sport from rugby football in the late 19th century. [[Arena football]] is a variant of American football.  In [[Canada]], the unqualified term &quot;football&quot; typically refers to [[Canadian football]], a game which is a close relative of American football but different in several respects.

==Popularity==
Since the 1960s, football has surpassed [[baseball]] as the most popular [[spectator sport]] in the United States. The 32-team [[National Football League]] (NFL) is the most popular and only [[major professional sports league|major]] professional American football [[Sports league|league]]. Its championship game, the [[Super Bowl]], is watched by nearly half of US television households, and is also televised in over 150 other countries. ''[[Super Bowl Sunday]]'' has become an annual ritual in late January or early February. Football is also the most watched sport on [[television]] in the US. 

The NFL also operates a developmental league, [[NFL Europe]], with 6 teams based in European cities.

&lt;!-- Possible image copyright issue
[[Image:American football tackle.jpg|thumb|250px|American football is a physically demanding sport.]]
--&gt;
[[College football]] is also extremely popular throughout the U.S., especially in markets not served by an NFL team.  Several college football stadiums seat more than 100,000 fans -- which regularly sell out. Even [[high school]] football games can attract five-figure crowds, especially in [[hotbed]]s like Western [[Pennsylvania]], [[Nebraska]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and most especially [[Texas]], [[Ohio]], and [[California]]. The weekly autumn ritual of college and high-school football -- which includes [[marching band]]s, [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]] and parties (including the ubiquitous [[tailgate party]]) -- is an important part of the culture in much of [[small-town|smalltown America]].  It is a long-standing tradition in the United States (though not universally observed) that high school football games are played on [[Friday]], college games on [[Saturday]], and professional games on [[Sunday]] (with an additional professional game on [[Monday]] nights--see ''[[Monday Night Football]]'').  It is often said of an outstanding college football player that he is likely to &quot;be playing on Sundays one day&quot;, meaning that he is a good pro prospect.

Certain fall and winter [[holiday]]s--most notably [[Thanksgiving]], [[Christmas]], and [[New Years' Day]]--have traditional football games associated with them.

Football is also played recreationally by amateur club and youth teams (e.g., the [[Pop Warner]] little-league programs). There are also many &quot;semi-pro&quot; teams in leagues where the players are paid to play, but at a small enough salary that they generally must also hold a full-time job.

Pro football is played only in the United States and in the above-mentioned NFL Europe league. The sport is popular as an amateur activity in [[Mexico]] and [[American Samoa]] and to a lesser extent in [[Japan]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]].

A very similar sport, [[Canadian football]], is widely played in [[Canada]].

Organized football is played almost exclusively by men and boys, although a few amateur and semi-professional women's leagues have begun play in recent years.

==The rules of American football==
{{See also|American football rules}}
&lt;!--This section should only be a basic tutorial. Lengthy content should go to [[American football rules]]--&gt;

The object of American football is to score more points than the opposing team within a set time limit.

===Field and players===
[[Image:AmFBfield.png|right|frame|The numbers on the field indicate the number of [[yard]]s to the nearest end zone.]]

The field is often called the ''gridiron'' because the markings on the field resemble a [[Grill (cooking)|grill]]. The game is played on a rectangular field 120 [[yard]]s (110 [[metre]]s) long by 53 1/3 yards (49 metres) wide. The longer boundary lines are ''sidelines'', while the shorter boundary lines are ''end lines''. Near each end of the field is a ''goal line''; they are 100 yards apart. A scoring area called an ''[[end zone]]'' extends 10 yards beyond each goal line to each end line.

''Yard lines'' cross the field every 5 yards, and are numbered from each goal line to the 50-yard line, or midfield (similar to a typical [[rugby league]] field). Two rows of lines, known as ''hash marks'', parallel the side lines near the middle of the field. All plays start with the ball on or between the hash marks.

At the back of each end zone are two ''goal posts'' (also called ''uprights'') that are 18.5 feet apart. The posts are connected by a crossbar 10 feet from the ground. Successful kicks must go above the crossbar and between the uprights.  (At many fields the uprights and crossbar are attached by a curved bar to a post outside the field of play, to reduce the chance of players running into the supports.)

Each team has 11 players on the field at a time. However, teams may substitute for any or all of their players between plays. As a result, players have very specialized roles, and almost all of the 53 players on an NFL team will play in any given game. Thus, teams are divided into three separate units: the [[offensive team|offense]], the [[defensive team|defense]] and the [[special teams]] (see below). In the NFL, players' [[jersey number]]s are distributed according to a strict system (e.g. quarterbacks always wear between 1-19).

===Game duration===
A standard football game consists of four 15-minute (typically 12 minutes in high school football) periods (called quarters), with an intermission (called halftime) after the second quarter. The clock stops after certain plays; therefore, a game can last considerably longer (often more than three hours in real time). If an NFL game is tied after four quarters, the teams play up to another 15 minutes. In an NFL overtime game, the first team that scores wins; if neither team scores, the game is a tie. College overtime rules are more complicated and are described at [[Overtime (sport)]].

===Advancing the ball===
Advancing the ball in American football resembles the ''six-tackle rule'' and the ''play-the-ball'' in [[Rugby league|rugby league football]]. The team that takes possession of the ball (the '''offense''') has four attempts, called '''[[Down (football)|downs]]''', to advance the ball 10 yards towards their opponent's (the '''defense'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s) end zone. When the offense gains 10 yards, it gets a '''first down''', or another set of four downs to gain 10 yards. If the offense fails to gain a first down (10 yards) after 4 downs, it loses possession of the ball.

Except at the beginning of halves and after scores (see ''Kickoffs and free kicks'' below), the ball is always put into play by a '''[[Snap (American football)|snap]]'''. All players line up facing each other at the [[line of scrimmage]] (the position on the field where the play begins).  One offensive player, the [[Center (football)|center]], then passes (or &quot;snaps&quot;) the ball between his legs to a teammate, usually the [[quarterback]].

Players can then advance the ball in two ways:
* By running with the ball, also known as '''[[Rush (football)|rushing]]'''. One ball-carrier can hand the ball to another; this is known as a '''handoff'''. 
* By throwing the ball to a teammate, known as '''passing'''.  The forward pass is a key factor distinguishing American and Canadian football from other football sports. The offense can throw the ball forward only once on a play and only from behind the line of scrimmage.  The ball can be thrown sideways or backwards at any time. This type of pass is known as a '''[[Lateral pass|lateral]]''' and is much rarer in American football than in rugby league or rugby union, where a backwards pass is mandatory.

A play or down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:
* The player with the ball is forced to the ground or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team (as determined by an official).
* A forward pass flies out of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an '''[[incomplete pass]]'''.  The ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down.  
* The ball or the player with the ball goes beyond the dimensions of the field ('''out of bounds''').
* A team scores.
* A certain penalty is committed (such as false start) that causes the play to be blown dead and replayed.
[[Official (American football)|Officials]] blow a whistle to notify all players that the play is over. 

At all times, players and fans must be aware of the sequence of downs and the distance to a new first down. When a team has a first down, the scoreboard or television screen flashes &quot;1st and 10&quot; — that is, first down and 10 yards to go. If the team gains three yards on the first play, for example, the next down will be &quot;2nd and 7.&quot;

===Changes of possession===
The offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things happens:

* The team fails to get a first down, that is, move the ball forward at least 10 yards in four downs. The defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the play ends.  A change of possession in this manner is commonly called a '''turnover on downs'''.
* The offense scores a touchdown or field goal. The team that scored then kicks off the ball to the other team. (See Scoring and Kickoffs below.) 
* The offense punts the ball to the defense. A '''[[punt (football)|punt]]''' is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground. Punts are nearly always made on fourth down, when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field (through a failed attempt to make a first down) and feels it is too far from the other team's goal posts to kick a field goal.
* A defensive player catches a forward pass. This is called an '''[[interception]]''', and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until tackled, forced out of bounds, or scores. After the intercepting player is tackled or forced out of bounds, his team's offensive unit returns to the field and takes over at his last position. 
* An offensive player drops the ball (a '''[[fumble]]''') and a defensive player picks it up. As with interceptions, a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled or forced out of bounds. Lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as '''turnovers'''.
* The offensive team misses a field goal attempt. The defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous play began (or, in the NFL, at the spot of the kick). If the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within 20 yards of the end zone, the other team gets the ball at its own 20-yard line (that is, 20 yards from the end zone). 
* An offensive player is tackled, forced out of bounds, or commits certain penalties in his own end zone.  This rare occurrence is called a '''[[Safety (football)|safety]]'''. (See ''Scoring'' below.)

===Scoring===
A team scores points by the following plays:
* A '''[[touchdown]]''' (TD) is worth 6 points. A touchdown is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent's end zone. 
** After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a '''conversion'''. The ball is placed at the other team's 3-yard-line (the 2-yard-line in the NFL). The team can attempt to kick it over the crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for 1 point (an '''[[extra point]]'''), or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for 2 points (a '''[[two-point conversion]]''').  In [[collegiate]] and [[professional]] leagues, the extra point is usually preferred; its success rate is 94% in the [[NFL]] and 93.8% in the [[NCAA]], compared to 43% in the [[NFL]] and 43.5% in the [[NCAA]] for two-point conversions. If the defense forces a turnover on an attempted conversion and runs the ball back to their opponent's endzone, they are awarded with 2 points (does not apply in the NFL).
* A '''[[field goal]]''' (FG) is worth 3 points, and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar and through the goal posts. Field goals may be placekicked (kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate) or drop-kicked. A field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to the goal line, or, when there is little or no time left to otherwise score.
* A '''[[Safety (football)|safety]]''' is worth 2 points. A safety is scored by the ''defense'' when the offensive player in possession of the ball is forced back into his own end zone and is tackled there, or fumbles the ball out of the end zone. Certain penalties by the offense occurring in the end zone also result in a safety.

===Kickoffs and free kicks===
Each half begins with a [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]. Teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals. The ball is kicked from a kicking tee, which is made from one's own 30-yard line in the NFL and from the 35-yard line in college football. The other team's kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible. Where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its '''drive''', or series of offensive plays. If a kick returner does not want to run with the ball, he has the option to signal for a &quot;fair catch&quot; by waving his hands in the air before the catch.  He will then be allowed to catch the ball and kneel it down on the field without being tackled.  If the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone, he can either run with the ball, or elect for a '''[[touchback]]''' by kneeling in the end zone. The receiving team can then start its offensive drive from its own 20-yard line. A touchback can also occur when the kick goes out of the end zone. Punts and turnovers in the end zone can also end in touchbacks. If a kickoff goes out of bounds over the sidelines without being interfered by the receiving team, the ball will be placed 30 yards from the spot of the kickoff (traditionally at the receiving team's 40-yard line in the NFL or the 35-yard line in college football).

After safeties, there is a '''[[Safety (American football)#free kick|free kick]]''' instead of a kickoff. A free kick is made from a team's own 20-yard-line and can be punted or placekicked.

===Penalties===
Rule violations are punished with '''penalties'''. Most penalties result in moving the football either towards the endzone in the case of a defensive penalty, or away from the endzone in the case of an offensive penalty. Some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down. In addition, if a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down, the first down is automatically given.  If a penalty occurs during a play, an official throws a yellow flag near the spot of the foul. When the play is over, the team that did not commit the penalty has the option of taking either the penalty or the result of the play. For example, say a defensive player commits an offsides penalty on first down by passing the line of scrimmage before the snap, and the offense gains eight yards on the play. The team with the ball has the option of taking the penalty and repeat the first down with five yards to go, or declining the penalty and scrimmaging with 2nd and 2.

====Some common penalties====
* '''False start''': A player on the offense, other than a back moving parallel to the line of scrimmage, moves just prior to the snap. Five yards.
* '''Offsides''': A player is on the wrong side of the ball at the start of a play.  Five yards.  Similar fouls:  Touching an opponent before the snap is '''encroachment'''; lining up alongside the football instead of behind it is a '''neutral zone infraction'''.
* '''Holding''': A blocker unfairly impedes a would-be tackler or pass receiver, by grabbing the player's jersey, hooking, or tackling.  When commited by the offense, or by either team on a change of possession, the penalty is ten yards.  When committed by the defense, the penalty is five yards and an automatic first down is awarded to the offense.  If the penalty occurred beyond the line of scrimmage, the penalty would be enforced from the spot of the foul.
* '''Pass interference''': After a pass is launched into the air, a defender pushes, hooks, grabs, or knocks down a would-be pass receiver, or if the receiver does the same to the defender to prevent an interception.  First down at the spot of the foul if against the defense (15 yards from the previous spot in college football), or ten yards from the previous spot if against the offense.  Similar penalties before a pass are called as '''holding''' or '''illegal contact'''.
* '''Facemask''': a player places his hand on an opponent's facemask during a play.  Five yards, or fifteen (a '''personal foul''') if the player hooks his fingers into the facemask or pulls on it.
* '''Roughing the passer/kicker''': A player places a hard hit on a passer long enough after a pass has been thrown to consider the contact avoidable, or places a hard hit on a punter or place kicker.  Fifteen yards and automatic first down.
* '''Running into the kicker''': A lighter contact on a kicker, especially after the kick has been made.  Five yards.
* '''Intentional grounding''': The passer throws a forward pass not near any eligible receiver, without first leaving the area behind where the blocking linemen were standing before the snap (the &quot;pocket&quot;), or the passer throws a forward pass outside of the pocket which does not reach the original '''line of scrimmage''' and is not near any eligible receiver.  Ten yards plus loss of down, except if the penalty occurred in the end zone, then it is ruled a safety, and the defense is awarded 2 points.  In college football and high school football, the defense is also credited with a quarterback sack.  Note that spiking the ball to stop the clock is exempt from this.
* '''Ineligible receiver downfield''': On every play the offense must have 7 players on the line of scrimmage, the player furthest from the ball on each side are eligible receivers; the interior five players are considered ineligible to receive passes.  This penalty is called if one of the 5 interior players is more than five yards past the line of scrimmage during a forward pass.
* '''Dead ball personal foul''': After the play is blown dead, a player tackles or makes rough contact with a player on the other team. Fifteen yards, automatic first down if on defense.
* '''Unnecessary roughness''': A catch-all for rough play that doesn't merit its own foul.  An example is an avoidable late hit on a ball carrier who has run out of bounds.  Fifteen yards.
* '''Unsportsmanlike conduct''': Another catch-all call, commonly used for taunting, excessive celebration after a touchdown, and certain banned forms of pantomime (like slashing the throat).  Fifteen yards.

==The players==
{{Main|American football positions}}
As noted above, most football players have highly specialized roles. At the college and NFL levels, most play only offense or only defense.

===Offense===
* The '''[[offensive line]]''' consists of five players whose job is to protect the passer and clear the way for runners by blocking members of the defense. Except for the center, offensive linemen generally do not handle the ball.
* The '''[[quarterback]]''' receives the ball on most plays. He then hands or tosses it to a running back, throws it to a receiver or runs with it himself. 
*'''[[Running back]]s''' line up behind or beside the QB and specialize in rushing with the ball. They also block, catch passes and, on rare occasions, pass the ball to others.
*'''[[Wide receiver]]s''' line up near the sidelines. They specialize in catching passes.
*'''[[Tight end]]s''' line up outside the offensive line. They can either play like wide receivers (try to catch passes) or like offensive linemen (protect the QB or create spaces for runners).

Not all of these types of players will be in on every offensive play. Teams can vary the number of wide receivers, tight ends and running backs on the field at one time.

===Defense===
* The '''[[defensive line]]''' consists of three to five players who line up across from the offensive line. They try to tackle the running backs before they can gain yardage or the quarterback before he can throw a pass.
* At least three players line up as '''[[defensive back]]s'''. They cover the receivers and try to stop pass completions. They occasionally rush the quarterback. 
* The other players on the defense are known as '''[[linebacker]]s'''. They line up between the defensive line and backs and may either rush the quarterback or cover potential receivers.

===Special teams===
The units of players who handle kicking plays are known as '''[[special teams]]'''. Special-teams feature players that include the '''[[punter (football position)|punter]]''', who handles punts, and the '''[[placekicker]]''' or '''kicker''', who kicks off and attempts field goals and extra points.

==Basic football strategy==
{{Main|American football strategy}}

To many fans, the chief draw of football is the chess game that goes on between the two coaching staffs. Each team has a '''playbook''' of dozens to hundreds of plays. Plays are the directions for what the players should do on a down. Some plays are very safe; they are very likely to get a few yards, but not much more than that. Other plays have the potential for long gains but a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover. 

Generally speaking, rushing plays are less risky than passing plays. However, there are relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays. To fool the other team, there are passing plays designed to look like running plays and vice versa. There are many trick or gadget plays, such as when a team lines up like it is going to kick and then tries to run or pass for a first down. Such high-risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work.  However, they can spell disaster if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts accordingly.

It has been said that football is the closest sport that strategically resembles real war, which may explain why it is by far the most popular sport in the American military. In fact, the [[United States Military Academy]], the [[United States Naval Academy]], and the [[United States Air Force Academy]] each field football teams that participate in [[Division I-A]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Army and Navy have a particularly historic [[Army-Navy Game|rivalry]].

==A physical game==
American football is a collision sport. To stop the offense from advancing the ball, the defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking him down. As such, defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball-carrier to the ground, within certain rules and guidelines. Tacklers cannot kick, punch or trip the runner. They also cannot grab the face mask of the runner's helmet, lead into a tackle with their own helmet, or lift the ball carrier up off his feet and drop him. Despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary roughness, most other forms of tackling are legal. Blockers and defenders trying to evade them also have wide leeway in trying to force their opponents out of the way. Quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders coming on full speed from outside the quarterback's field of vision. 

The high level of physical contact in football makes it more dangerous than other major American team sports. To compensate for this, players must wear a good deal of special protective equipment, such as a padded plastic [[football helmet|helmet]], [[shoulder pads]], hip pads and knee pads. These protective &quot;paddings&quot; were introduced decades ago and improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players. 

Despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety, injuries remain very common in football, due to its physical nature. Twenty-five football players, mostly high schoolers, died from injuries directly related to football from 2000-2004, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research.  [[concussion|Concussions]] are common, with an estimated 62,000 suffered every year among high school players according to the Brain Injury Association of Arizona.  [http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-23-2005/0004093186&amp;EDATE=].  It is common to see injuries in the game, and deaths are not unheard of. The game is particularly risky when played by amateurs without proper gear, such as is common amongst Americans in backyards and parks across the country. 

Some have criticized American football as a violent sport. American football is indeed quite physical in comparison to sports like [[basketball]] and [[soccer]] as well as other major American team sports. Tackle football is often banned in American schoolyards in favor of [[touch football]], which uses two-hand touching instead of tackling; or [[flag football]] in which a player is &quot;tackled&quot; when an opponent pulls a flag off a belt attached to the player's waist.  School [[physical education]] classes often use the &quot;two-hand touch&quot; version of the game, leaving the tackles to the school's official after-school sports program which can provide the appropriate gear and supervision.

The level of physical aggression and risk of injury has also made football less appealing to females, as they generally lack the muscle and body mass to compete without serious risk. The tackle nature of football also tends to favor the largest and strongest players, along with the fastest. The average weight of players in the NFL has increased in recent years.

All these factors have brought the sport into controversy in the past few decades, joining the group of other &quot;violent&quot; and thus controversial sports such as [[dodgeball]], [[wrestling]], [[hockey]], and [[boxing]]. Critics argue that these sports emphasize size, physical strength, and brute force, and breed aggression and unhealthy competitive attitudes in children. Others argue that such sports teach sportsmanship and teamwork, and though [[contact sports]] are all violent to some degree, they always emphasize skill and strategy over mere belligerence.

==Development of the game==
{{Details|History of American football}}

Both American football and soccer have their origins in [[football|varieties of football]] played in the [[United Kingdom]] in the mid-19th century, and American football is directly descended from [[rugby football]].

Rugby was first introduced to North America in [[Canada]], brought by the [[British Army]] garrison in [[Montreal]] which played a series of games with [[McGill University]]. Both Canadian and American football evolved from this point. For an in-depth overview of the differences and similarities of [[Canadian football]] and American football see: [[Comparison of Canadian and American football]]

American colleges spearheaded the growth of football.  The [http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first_game.htm first inter-collegiate football game] was played between Rutgers and Princeton Universities on November 6, 1869.  The game was won by Rutgers (6-4) although &quot;The game, which bore little resemblance to its modern-day counterpart, was played with two teams of 25 men each under rugby-like rules, but like modern football, it was “replete with surprise, strategy, prodigies of determination, and physical prowess,” to use the words of one of the Rutgers players.&quot; - [http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first_game.htm Rutgers Football]

American football in its current form grew out of a series of three games between [[Harvard University]] and [[McGill University]] of [[Montreal]] in 1874. McGill played [[rugby football]] while Harvard played the [[Boston Game]], which was closer to soccer. As often happened in those days of far from universal rules, the teams alternated rules so that both would have a fair chance. The Harvard players liked having the opportunity to run with the ball, and in 1875 persuaded [[Yale University]] to adopt rugby rules for their annual game. In 1876 Yale, Harvard, [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] formed the [[Intercollegiate Football Association]], which used the rugby code, except for a slight difference in scoring.

In 1880 [[Walter Camp]] introduced the scrimmage in place of the rugby [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]. In 1882 the system of downs was introduced to thwart Princeton's and Yale's strategy of controlling the ball without trying to score. In 1883 the number of players was reduced, at Camp's urging, to eleven, and Camp introduced the soon standard arrangement of a seven-man offensive line with a quarterback, two halfbacks, and a fullback.

On [[September 3]], [[1895]] the first professional football game was played, in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], between the Latrobe [[YMCA]] and the Jeannette Athletic Club. (Latrobe won the contest 12-0.).  

By the 1890s interlocking offensive formations such as the flying wedge and the practice of teammates physically dragging ball-carrying players forward had made the game extremely dangerous. Despite restrictions on the flying wedge and other precautions, in 1905 eighteen players were killed in games. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] informed the universities that the game must be made safer.  To force them to respond to his concerns, he threatened to pressure Congress to make playing football a federal crime.

In 1906, two rival organizing bodies, the [[Intercollegiate Rules Committee]] and the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]], met in New York; eventually they agreed on several new rules intended to make the game safer, among them the addition of a neutral zone between the scrimmage lines and a requirement that at least six players from each team line up on them. The most far-reaching innovation they considered, though, was the legalization of the forward pass. This was very controversial at the time, much derided by purists. As an alternative means of opening out the play, Walter Camp would have preferred widening the field; but representatives from Harvard pointed to recently constructed [[Harvard Stadium]], which could not be widened, and the forward pass was adopted; it has come to shape the whole history of American football, as opposed to its cousins around the world.

In 1910, after further deaths, interlocking formations were finally outlawed; and in 1912 the field was changed to its current size, the value of a touchdown increased to 6 points, and a fourth down added to each possession. The game had achieved its modern form.

==Problems in football==
{{Main|Issues in American Football}}

Injuries are more common in American football than in many other sports, although rule changes made in the past 90 years (for instance, the elimination of &quot;[[Horse-collar tackle|horse-collar tackles]]&quot;) have gradually lowered the rates of injuries. In addition, protective equipment has become better - for example, the optional leather helmets introduced during the 1890s have been replaced (in several stages) by required high-tech padded plastic helmets with bars protecting the face.

More recently, the use of steroids and the extent thereof has become an object of debate in professional, college, and even high school football leagues.

Another problem with football is that it is an expensive sport.  The specialized helmets, uniforms, and pads can cost hundreds of dollars.  There is a widespread perception that football teams based in schools and public recreational leagues consume far more than their fair share of the sports budget, although sales of tickets to college (and to some extent high school) football games often make it a revenue-producing sport.

==Professional, college, and other leagues==
Football is played at a number of levels in the United States.  These include the following:
* [[National Football League]] (NFL) - the top-level men's professional league
* [[NFL Europe]] - semi-professional league in [[Europe]]
* [[College football]] - played at many U.S. colleges
* [[American Football Association]] National organization for the advancement and promotion of semi-pro/minor league football teams and leagues in the United States.
* [[North American Football League]] - Amateur minor league with more than 100 member organizations since 1996
* [[Women's American football]] - since 2000, there has been a surge of women's professional leagues.
* High school football - played at most U.S. High Schools
* [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] or youth football - involves younger children who are too young to play high school, generally in middle school.
* [[Sprint football]] - players must weigh no more than 172 pounds

American football is also played in many nations around the world.  Some of the organizations/leagues that play American football are:
* [[Mexican College Football]] League or [[ONEFA]] - played by many Mexican colleges, with essentially NCAA rules
* [[British Collegiate American Football League]] (BCAFL) - Fast-growing college football league in the UK
* [[British American Football League]] (BAFL)-Higher League of American Football in the UK
* [[European Federation of American Football]] (www.efaf.info) European organization that crowns its champion in the [[Euro Bowl]]
* [[German Football League]]
* [[Gridiron Australia]] - national body of several state-level leagues
* [[International Federation of American Football]] International governing body for American football with 39 member associations from North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania.  The IFAF also overseas the World Championship of American Football.
* [[Okinawan Football League]] - Various football teams made up of U.S. servicemembers and one from Ryuku University

Other kinds of football with quite different rules:
* [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) - men's professional league based in [[Canada]], played using different rules known as [[Canadian football]]
* [[Arena Football League]] - mid-level men's professional league. Played in indoor stadiums, hence the name &quot;arena&quot; football. One of the nation's fastest-growing sports.
* [[Nine-man football]], [[Eight-man football]], and [[Six-man football]] - variations of high school football, usually played in sparsely populated areas
* Amateur and youth league football
* [[Flag football]] and [[Touch football (American)|Touch football]] - non-tackle; almost exclusively amateur

The descriptions in this article are based primarily on the current rules of the [[National Football League]] (NFL, 1920-present). Differences with college rules will be noted. Professional, college, high school, and amateur rules are similar.

Professional leagues that no longer exist:
* [[World Football League]] (WFL, 1974-75) 
* [[United States Football League]] (USFL, 1983-1985) 
* [[XFL]] (XFL, 2001)
* [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC, 1946-1949) (2 teams are now in the NFL) 
* [[World League of American Football]] (WLAF, 1991-1993 &amp;mdash; now [[NFL Europe]]), 
* [[American Football League]]s (AFL),  four separate ones: I:1926, II: 1937-38, III: 1940-1941 and IV: 1960-1969). The fourth AFL (1960-1969) merged with the NFL in 1970 and now exists (mostly) as the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] with several new teams. The old NFL appeared as the [[National Football Conference|NFC]].

The '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775–1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''', was the military component of the [[American Revolution]]. It was fought primarily between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and revolutionaries within [[13 colonies|thirteen British colonies]] in [[North America]], who proclaimed themselves as the [[United States|United States of America]] early in the war. The war began largely as a colonial revolt against the [[mercantilism|economic policies]] of the [[British Empire]], and eventually widened far beyond [[British North America]], with [[France]], [[Spain]], and the [[Netherlands]] entering the war against Great Britain. Additionally, many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] fought on both sides of the conflict.

Throughout the war, the British were able to use their naval superiority to capture and occupy coastal cities, but control of the countryside (where most of the population lived) largely eluded them. French involvement proved decisive, with a naval [[Battle of the Chesapeake|victory in the Chesapeake]] leading to the surrender of a British army at the [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Battle of Yorktown]] in 1781. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 recognized the independence of the [[United States|United States of America]].

The terms ''American Revolutionary War'' and ''American Revolution'' are often used interchangeably, though the American Revolution included political and social developments before and after the war itself. This article refers solely to the military campaign; for a broader perspective, including the origins and aftermath of the war, see the article on the [[American Revolution]].

== Combatants ==
===Choosing sides===
Colonists were divided over which side to support in the war; in some areas, the struggle was a [[civil war]]. The [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Revolutionaries]] (also known as Americans or Patriots) had the support of about 40 to 45 percent of the colonial population. About 15 to 20 percent of the population supported the British Crown during the war, and were known as [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists (or Tories)]]. Loyalists fielded perhaps 50,000 men during the war years in support of the British Empire. After the war, some 70,000 Loyalists departed, most going to [[Canada]], Great Britain, or to British colonies in the [[Caribbean]].{{ref|loyalists}}

When the war began, the Americans did not have a professional [[armed force|army]] (also known as a &quot;[[standing army]]&quot;). Each colony had traditionally provided for its own defenses through the use of local [[militia]]. Militiamen served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were generally reluctant to go very far from home, and would often come and go as they saw fit. Militia typically lacked the training and discipline of regular troops, but could be effective when an emergency energized them. 

Seeking to coordinate military efforts, the [[Continental Congress]] established (on paper) a regular army—the [[Continental Army]]—in June 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as [[commander-in-chief]]. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington reluctantly augmented the regular troops with militia throughout the war. Although as many as 250,000 men may have served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, there were never more than 90,000 total men under arms for the Americans in any given year. Armies in North America were small by European standards of the era; the greatest number of men that Washington personally commanded in the field at any one time was fewer than 17,000.{{ref|continental}}

===European nations===

Early in 1775, the British army consisted of about 36,000 men worldwide, but wartime [[recruitment]] steadily increased this number. Additionally, over the course of the war the British hired about 30,000 [[Ethnic German|German]] [[mercenaries]], popularly known in the colonies as &quot;[[Hessians]]&quot; because many of them came from [[Hesse-Kassel]]. Germans would make up about one-third of the British troop strength in North America. By 1779, the number of British and German troops stationed in North America was over 60,000, though these were spread from [[Canada]] to [[Florida]].{{ref|British}}

[[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Spain]] entered the war against Great Britain in an attempt to dilute Britain's emerging [[superpower]] status. Early on, all three countries quietly provided financial assistance to the American rebels. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France officially entered the war]] in 1778 and soon sent troops, ships, and military equipment to fight against the British for the remainder of the war. Spain entered the war in 1779, officially as an ally of France but not the United States&amp;mdash;Spain was not keen on encouraging similar rebellions in [[Spanish Empire|her own empire]]. The Netherlands entered the war late in 1780, but was soon overwhelmed by the British.

===Blacks and Native Americans===
[[African-Americans]], [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] and [[free black]]s, served on both sides during the war.  Black soldiers served in northern militias from the outset, but this was forbidden in the South, where slaveowners feared arming slaves. [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the Royal Governor of [[Virginia]], issued an emancipation proclamation in November 1775, promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the British; [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]] issued a similar edict in New York in 1779.  Tens of thousands of slaves escaped to the British lines, although possibly as few as 1,000 served under arms.  Many of the rest served as orderlies, mechanics, laborers, servants, scouts and guides, although more than half died in smallpox epidemics that swept the British forces, and a number were driven out of the British lines when food ran low. Despite Dunmore's promises, the majority were not given their freedom.{{ref|black_loyalists}}

In response, and because of manpower shortages, Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. All-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many were slaves promised freedom for serving in lieu of their masters. Another all-black unit came from [[Haiti]] with French forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Patriot cause.{{ref|black_patriots}}

Most [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] communities east of the [[Mississippi River]] were affected by the war, many divided over the question of which side to support. Most Native Americans who joined the fight fought against the United States, since native lands were threatened by expanding American settlement. An estimated 13,000 warriors fought on the British side; the largest group, the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], fielded about 1,500 warriors against the Americans.{{ref|warriors}}

=== Massachusetts, 1774 to 1776 ===

In 1774, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] effectively [[Massachusetts Government Act|abolished the provincial government]] of [[Massachusetts]]. [[Lieutenant General]] [[Thomas Gage]], already the [[commander-in-chief]] of British troops in North America, was also appointed governor of Massachusetts and was instructed by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George's]] government to enforce royal authority in the troublesome colony. However, popular resistance compelled the newly appointed royal officials in Massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Gage commanded four [[regiment]]s of British regulars (about 4,000 men) from his headquarters in Boston, but the countryside was in the hands of the Revolutionaries.

On the night of [[April 18]] [[1775]], General Gage sent 900 men to seize [[munition]]s stored by the colonial militia at [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. Several riders—including [[Paul Revere]]—alerted the countryside, and when the British troops entered [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] on the morning of April 19, they found 75 [[Minutemen (militia)|minutemen]] formed up on the village common. Shots were exchanged, and the British moved on to Concord, where there was more fighting. By the time the &quot;redcoats&quot; (as the British soldiers were called) began the return march, several thousand militiamen had gathered along the road. A running fight ensued, and the British detachment suffered heavily. With the [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]]—the &quot;[[shot heard 'round the world]]&quot;—the war had begun.

Afterwards, thousands of militiamen converged on Boston, [[siege of Boston|bottling up the British]] in the city. Late in May, Gage received by sea about 4,500 reinforcements and a trio of generals who would play a vital role in the war: [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], [[John Burgoyne]], and [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]]. They formulated a plan to break out of the city.

On [[June 17]], [[1775]], British forces under General Howe seized the Charleston peninsula at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The battle was technically a British victory, but losses were so heavy that the attack was not followed up. Thus the [[siege]] was not broken, and General Gage was soon replaced by General Howe as the British commander-in-chief.

In July 1775, newly appointed General Washington arrived outside Boston to take charge of the colonial forces. The standoff continued throughout the fall and winter. In early March 1776, heavy [[cannon]]s that had been [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1775)|captured by the Revolutionaries]] at [[Fort Ticonderoga]] were moved to Boston, a difficult feat engineered by [[Henry Knox]]. When the guns were placed on [[Dorchester Heights]], overlooking the British positions, Howe's situation became untenable. The British [[Evacuation Day|evacuated]] the city on [[March 17]], [[1776]] and sailed for temporary refuge in [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. The local militia dispersed and, in April, Washington took most of the Continental Army to fortify [[New York City]].

=== Canada, 1775 to 1776 ===
During the long standoff at Boston, the Continental Congress sought a way to seize the initiative elsewhere. Congress had initially invited [[French-Canadian]]s to join them as the fourteenth colony, but when that failed to happen, an [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]] was authorized in an attempt to drive the British from the primarily [[francophone]] colony of Quebec (comprising present-day [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]). Two expeditions were undertaken. On [[September 16]], [[1775]], Brigadier General [[Richard Montgomery]] marched north from Fort Ticonderoga with about 1,700 militiamen, capturing [[Montreal]] on November 13. General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], the governor of Canada, escaped to [[Quebec City|Quebec City]].

[[Arnold Expedition|The second expedition]], led by Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]], set out from [[Fort Western]] (present day [[Maine]]) on September 25. The expedition was a logistical nightmare, and many men succumbed to [[smallpox]]. By the time Arnold reached Quebec City in early November, he had but 600 of his original 1,100 men. Nevertheless, Arnold demanded the surrender of the city, to no avail. Montgomery joined Arnold, and they [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attacked Quebec City]] on December 31, but were soundly defeated by Carleton. Montgomery was killed, Arnold was wounded, and many men were taken prisoner. The Americans held on outside Quebec City until the spring of 1776, and then withdrew.

Another attempt was made by the Revolutionaries to push back towards Quebec, but failed at [[Battle of Trois-Rivières|Trois-Rivières]] on [[June 8]], [[1776]]. Carleton then launched his own invasion,
