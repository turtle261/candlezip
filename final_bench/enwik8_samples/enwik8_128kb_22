he resulting film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'', was released in [[1927 in film|1927]] and was a major commercial and critical success.  Like many of his earlier works it was influenced by [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] techniques he had witnessed first hand in Germany. In it, attractive blondes are strangled and the new lodger ([[Ivor Novello]]) in the Bunting family's upstairs apartment falls under heavy suspicion.  This is the first truly &quot;Hitchcockian&quot; film, incorporating such themes as the &quot;wrong man&quot;.

Following the success of ''The Lodger'', Hitchcock began his first  efforts to promote himself in the media, and hired a publicist to cement his growing reputation as one of the British film industry's rising stars. In 1926, he was to marry his assistant director [[Alma Reville]]. They had a daughter, Patricia, in 1928. Alma was Hitchcock's closest collaborator. She wrote some of his screenplays and worked with him on every one of his films.

In 1929, he began work on ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', his tenth film. While the film was in production, the studio decided to make it one of Britain's first sound pictures. With the climax of the film taking place on the dome of the [[British Museum]], ''Blackmail'' also began the Hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as the backdrop to a story.

In 1933, Hitchcock was once again working for Michael Balcon at Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. His first film for the company, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), was a success, while his second, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)| The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), is often considered one of the best films from his early period. It was also one of the first to introduce the concept of the &quot;[[MacGuffin]]&quot;, a plot device around which a whole story would revolve. In ''The 39 Steps'', the MacGuffin is a stolen set of blueprints. 

His next major success was in 1938, ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'', a clever and fast-paced film about the search for a kindly old Englishwoman ([[Dame May Whitty]]), who disappears while on board a train in the fictional country of Vandrika (a thinly-veiled version of [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]).

By the end of the 1930s, Hitchcock was at the top of his game artistically, and in a position to name his own terms when [[David O. Selznick]] managed to entice the Hitchcocks across to Hollywood.

===Hollywood===
Hitchcock's ''[[gallows humour]]'' continued in his American work, together with the suspense that became his trademark. However, working arrangements with his new producer were less than optimal. Selznick suffered from perennial money problems and Hitchcock was often unhappy with the amount of creative control demanded by Selznick over his films. Subsequently, Selznick ended up &quot;loaning&quot; Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself.

With the prestigious picture ''[[Rebecca (film)|Rebecca]]'' in 1940, Hitchcock made his first American movie, although it was set in England and based on a novel by English author Dame [[Daphne du Maurier]]. This [[Gothic novel|Gothic]] [[melodrama]] explores the fears of a naïve young bride who enters a great English country home and must grapple with a distant husband, a predatory housekeeper, and the legacy of her husband's late wife. It has also subsequently been noted for the lesbian undercurrents in [[Judith Anderson]]'s performance. The film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] of 1940.  Hitchcock's second American film, the European-set thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent]]'' was also nominated for Best Picture that year. 

Hitchcock's work during the 1940's was very diverse, ranging from the romantic comedy, ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941) and the courtroom drama ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (1947), to the dark and disturbing ''Shadow of a Doubt'' (1943). 

''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'', his personal favorite, was about young Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton ([[Teresa Wright]]), who suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Spencer ([[Joseph Cotten]]) of murder. In its use of overlapping characters, dialogue, and closeups it has provided a generation of film theorists with psychoanalytic potential, including [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. The film also harkens to one of Cotten's better known films, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.

''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' explored the then very fashionable subject of [[psychoanalysis]] and featured a dream sequence which was designed by [[Salvador Dali]]. The actual dream sequence in the film was considerably cut from the original planned scene that was to run for some minutes but proved too disturbing for the finished film.

''[[Notorious]]'' (1946) marked Hitchcock's first film as a producer as well as director. As Selznick failed to see the subject's potential, he allowed Hitchcock to make the film for [[RKO]]. From this point on, Hitchcock would produce his own films, giving him a far greater degree of freedom to pursue the projects that interested him.  Starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and Hitchcock regular [[Cary Grant]], and featuring a plot about Nazis, uranium, and South America, ''[[Notorious]]'' was a huge box office success and has remained one of Hitchcock's most acclaimed films.  Its inventive use of suspense and props briefly led to Hitchcock being under surveillance by the [[CIA]] due to his use of [[uranium]] as a plot device.  

''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Rope|Rope]]'' (his first color film) came next in 1948. Here Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]''. He also experimented with exceptionally long takes - up to ten minutes (see [[Alfred Hitchcock#Themes and devices|Themes and devices]]).  Featuring [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, ''Rope'' was the first of an eventual four films Stewart would make for Hitchcock.  Based on the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s, ''Rope'' is also among the earliest openly gay-themed films to emerge from the [[Hays Office]] controlled Hollywood studio era.

''[[Under Capricorn]]'', set in nineteenth-century Australia, also used this short-lived technique, but to a more limited extent. For these two films he formed a production company with Sidney Bernstein, called Transatlantic Pictures, which folded after these two unsuccessful pictures.

===Peak years and decline===
With ''[[Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), his first epic film based on the novel by [[Patricia Highsmith]], Hitchcock combined many of the best elements from his preceding British and American films.  Two men casually meet and speculate on removing people who are causing them difficulty. One of the men, though, takes this banter entirely seriously. With [[Farley Granger]] reprising some elements of his role from ''Rope'', ''Strangers'' continued the director's interest in the narrative possiblities of homosexual blackmail and murder. 

Three very popular films, all starring [[Grace Kelly]], followed. ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' was adapted from the popular stage play by Frederick Knott. This was originally another experimental film, with Hitchcock using the technique of [[3-D film|3D]] cinematography, although the film was never released in this format. ''[[Rear Window]]'', starred James Stewart again, as well as [[Thelma Ritter]] and [[Raymond Burr]]. Here the wheelchair-bound Stewart observes the movements of his neighbours across the courtyard and becomes convinced one of them has murdered his wife. Like ''[[Lifeboat]]'' and ''[[Rope]]'', the movie was photographed almost entirely within the confines of a small space: Stewart's tiny studio apartment overlooking the massive courtyard set. ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', set in the French Riviera, starred Kelly and [[Cary Grant]]. 

In 1956, Hitchcock also remade his 1934 film ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'', this time with [[James Stewart]] and [[Doris Day]]. 

1958's ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' again starred Stewart, this time with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]]. The film was a commercial failure, but has come to be viewed by many as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. 

Hitchcock followed ''Vertigo'' with three very different films, which were all massive commercial successes. All are also recognised as among his very best films: ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). The latter two were particularly notable for their unconventional soundtracks, both by [[Bernard Herrmann]]: the screeching strings in the murder scene in ''Psycho'' pushed the limits of the time, and ''The Birds'' dispensed completely with conventional instruments, using an electronically produced soundtrack. These were his last great films, after which his career slowly wound down. In 1972 Hitchcock returned to [[London]] to film ''[[Frenzy]]'', his last major success. For the first time, Hitchcock allowed nudity and profane language, which had before been taboo, in one of his films. 

Failing health slowed down his output over the last two decades of his life.

''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was his last film. It related the escapades of &quot;Madam&quot; Blanche Tyler played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi driver lover [[Bruce Dern]] making a living from her phony powers. [[William Devane]] and [[Katherine Helmond]] co-starred.

Hitchcock was created a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in the 1980 [[New Years Honours]]. He died just four months later, on [[April 29]], before he had the opportunity to be formally invested by the Queen. He was nevertheless entitled to be known as '''Sir Alfred Hitchcock''' and to use the postnominal letters [[KBE]], because he remained a British subject when he adopted American citizenship in 1956.

Alfred Hitchcock died from [[renal failure]] in his [[Bel Air]], [[Los Angeles]], home aged 80, and was survived by his wife [[Alma Reville]], and their daughter, Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell. His body was cremated, and apparently there was no public funeral or memorial service.

==Themes and devices==
Hitchcock preferred the use of suspense over surprise in his films. In surprise, the director assaults the viewer with frightening things. In suspense, the director tells or shows things to the audience which the characters in the film do not know, and then artfully builds tension around what will happen when the characters finally learn the truth.

Further blurring the moral distinction between the innocent and the guilty, occasionally making this indictment clear, Hitchcock also makes voyeurs of his &quot;respectable&quot; audience. In ''Rear Window'' ([[1954 in film|1954]]), after L. B. Jeffries (played by James Stewart) has been staring across the courtyard at him for most of the film, Lars Thorwald (played by [[Raymond Burr]]) confronts Jeffries by saying &quot;What do you want of me?&quot; Burr might as well have been addressing the audience.  In fact, shortly before asking this, Thorwald turns to face the camera directly for the first time &amp;mdash; at this point, audiences often gasp.

One of Hitchcock's favourite devices for driving the plots of his stories and creating suspense was what he called the &quot;[[MacGuffin]].&quot; The plots of many of his suspense films revolve around a &quot;MacGuffin&quot;: a detail which, by inciting curiosity and desire, drives the plot and motivates the actions of characters within the story, but whose specific identity and nature is unimportant to the spectator of the film. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', for instance, &quot;Carlotta Valdes&quot; is a MacGuffin; she never appears and the details of her death are unimportant to the viewer, but the story about her ghost's haunting of Madeleine Elster is the spur for Scottie's investigation of her, and hence the film's entire plot. In ''[[Notorious]]'' the uranium that the main characters must recover before it reaches Nazi hands serves as a similarly arbitrary motivation: any dangerous object would suffice. And state secrets of various kinds serve as MacGuffins in several of the spy films, like ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)| The 39 Steps]]''.

Most of Hitchcock's films contain [[cameo role|cameo]] [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|appearances by Hitchcock himself]]: the director would be seen for a brief moment boarding a bus, crossing in front of a building, standing in an apartment across the courtyard, or appearing in a photograph. This playful gesture became one of Hitchcock's signatures. As a recurring theme he would carry a musical instrument &amp;mdash; especially memorable was the large double bass case that he wrestles onto the train at the beginning of ''[[Strangers on a Train]]''. 

In his earliest appearances he would fill in as an obscure extra, standing in a crowd or walking through a scene in a long camera shot. But he became more prominent in his later appearances, as when he turns to see [[Jane Wyman]]'s disguise when she passes him on the street in ''[[Stage Fright]]'', and in stark silhouette in his final film ''[[Family Plot]]''. In another amusing cameo, albeit just a photograph, Hitchcock's picture is seen in the &quot;before&quot;
side of a newspaper weight loss ad in ''[[Lifeboat]]''. (See a [[list of Hitchcock cameo appearances]].)  

Hitchcock includes the consumption of brandy in nearly every sound film.  &quot;I'll get you some brandy. Drink this down. Just like medicine ...&quot; says James Stewart's character to [[Kim Novak]], in ''Vertigo.''  In a real life incident,  Hitchcock dared Montgomery Clift at a dinner party around the filming of ''I Confess'' to swallow a carafe of brandy, which caused his lead actor to pass out, almost immediately. This near obsession with brandy remains unexplained.

Another almost inexplicable feature of any Hitchcock film is the inclusion of a staircase. Of course, stairways inspire many suspenseful moments, most notably [[Farley Granger]]'s character visit to the murderer in ''[[Strangers On A Train]]'' or the detective's demise in the Bates' mansion in ''Psycho.'' However, a completely nonfunctional staircase adorns the apartment of the James Stewart character in ''[[Rear Window]]'', as if Hitchcock feels compelled to its inclusion by some unspoken superstition.

Hitchcock seemed to delight in the technical challenges of filmmaking. In ''Lifeboat'', Hitchcock sets the entire action of the movie in a small boat, yet manages to keep the cinematography from monotonous repetition. His trademark cameo appearance was a dilemma, given the claustrophobic setting; so Hitchcock appeared on camera in a fictitious newspaper ad for a weight loss product.  

In ''Spellbound'' two unprecedented point-of-view shots were achieved by constructing a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and outsized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-colored red on some copies of the black-and-white print of the film.

''Rope'' (1948) was another technical challenge: a film that appears to have been shot entirely in a single take. The film was actually shot in eight takes of approximately 10 minutes each, which was the amount of film that would fit in a single camera reel; the transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place.

His 1958 film ''Vertigo'' contains a camera trick that has been imitated and re-used so many times by filmmakers, it has become known as the [[Hitchcock zoom]].

Although famous for inventive camera angles, Hitchcock generally avoided points of view that were physically impossible from a human perspective. For example, he would never place the camera looking out from inside a refrigerator.

Regarding Hitchcock's sometimes less than pleasant relationship with actors, there was a persistent rumor that he had said that actors were cattle.  Hitchcock later denied this, typically [[tongue-in-cheek]], clarifying that he had only said that actors should be treated like cattle.  [[Carole Lombard]], tweaking Hitchcock and drumming up a little publicity, brought some cows along with her when she reported to the set of ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]''.

Hitchcock often dealt with matters that he felt were sexually preverse or kinky, and many of his films darring subverted the restrictive Hollywood Production Code that prohibited any mention of [[homosexuality]].

==His character and its effects on his films==
Hitchcock's films sometimes feature male characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers. In ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]'s character) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him (in this case, they are).  In ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963), the [[Rod Taylor]] character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself of a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolizes his mother. The villain Bruno in ''[[Strangers on a Train]]'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Norman Bates' troubles with his mother in ''[[Psycho]]'' are infamous. 

Hitchcock heroines tend to be lovely, cool blondes who seem at first to be proper but, when aroused by passion or danger, respond in a more sensual, animal, perhaps criminal way. As noted, the famous victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes. In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)| The 39 Steps]]'', Hitchcock's glamorous blonde star, [[Madeleine Carroll]], is put in handcuffs. In ''[[Marnie]]'' (1964), glamorous blonde [[Tippi Hedren]] is a [[kleptomania]]c. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), glamorous blonde [[Grace Kelly]] offers to help someone she believes is a cat burglar. After becoming interested in Thorwald's life in ''Rear Window'', Lisa breaks into Thorwald's apartment. And, most notoriously, in ''Psycho'', [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 and gets murdered by a young man named [[Norman Bates]] (played by [[Anthony Perkins]]) who thought he was his own mother. His last blonde heroine was French actress [[Claude Jade]] as the secret agent's worried daughter, Michele, in '''Topaz''' (1969).

Hitchcock saw that reliance on actors and actresses was a holdover from the theater tradition.  He was a pioneer in using camera movement, camera set ups and montage to explore the outer reaches of cinematic art.

Most critics and Hitchcock scholars, including Donald Spoto and Roger Ebert, agree that ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' is probably the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires. ''Vertigo'' explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other film in his filmography.

Hitchcock often said that his personal favourite was ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''.

==His style of working==
Hitchcock once commented, &quot;The writer and I plan out the entire script down to the smallest detail, and when we're finished all that's left to do is to shoot the film. Actually, it's only when one enters the studio that one enters the area of compromise. Really, the novelist has the best casting since he doesn't have to cope with the actors and all the rest.&quot; Hitchcock was often critical of his actors and actresses as well, dismissing, for example, Kim Novak's performance in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', and once famously remarking that actors were to be treated like cattle. (In response to being accused of saying 'actors are cattle', he said 'I never said they were cattle; I said they were to be ''treated'' like cattle'.) 

The first book devoted to the director is simply named ''Hitchcock''. It is a document of a one-week interview by [[François Truffaut]] in 1967. (ISBN 0671604295)

==Awards==
The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Hitchcock the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], in 1967.  However, despite six earlier nominations, he never won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] in a contested category. His unsuccessful Oscar nominations were:

* for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]:  ''Rebecca'' (1940), ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944), ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Rear Window]]'', and ''[[Psycho]]''; and
* as a producer, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]: ''[[Suspicion]]'' (1941).  

However ''Rebecca'', which Hitchcock did direct, won the 1940 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar for its producer [[David O. Selznick]].  Three other films Hitchcock directed were unsuccessfully nominated for Best Picture.

Hitchcock was knighted in 1980.



==Other notes==
From [[1955 in television|1955]] to [[1965 in television|1965]], Hitchcock was the host and producer of a long-running [[television]] series entitled ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. While his films had made Hitchcock's name strongly associated with suspense, the TV series made Hitchcock a celebrity himself. His [[irony]]-tinged voice, image, and mannerisms became instantly recognizable and were often the subject of parody. He directed a few episodes of the TV series himself and he upset a number of movie production companies when he insisted on using his TV production crew to produce his motion picture ''[[Psycho]]''. In the late 1980s, a new version of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions.

Alfred Hitchcock is also immortalised in print and appeared as himself in the very popular juvenile detective series, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators''. The long-running detective series was clever and well written, with characters much younger than the [[Hardy Boys]]. In ghost-written introductions, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&quot; formerly introduced each case at the beginning of the book, often giving them new cases to solve. At the end of each book, Alfred Hitchcock would discuss the specifics of the case with Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshaw and every so often the three boys would give Alfred Hitchcock mementos of their case. 

When Alfred Hitchcock passed away, his chores as the boys' mentor/friend would be done by a fictional character: a retired detective named Hector Sebastian.  Due to the popularity of the series, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators'' scored several reprints and out of respect, the latter reprints were changed to just ''[[The Three Investigators]]''. Over the years, more than one name has been used to replace Alfred Hitchcock's character, especially for the earlier books when his role was emphasised.  

At the height of Hitchcock's success, he was also asked to introduce a set of books with his name attached. The series was a collection of short stories by popular short story writers, primarily focused on suspense and thrillers. These titles included ''Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum'', ''Alfred Hithcock's Supernatural Tales of Terror and Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbinders in Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Witch's Brew'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery'' and ''Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful.''  Hitchcock himself was not actually involved in the reading, reviewing, editing or selection of the short stories; in fact, even his introductions were ghost-written. The entire extent of his involvement with the project was to lend his name and collect a check.

Some notable writers whose works were used in the collection include [[Shirley Jackson]] (''Strangers in Town'', ''[[The Lottery]]''), [[T.H. White]] (''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''), [[Robert Bloch]], [[H. G. Wells]] (''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]''), [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Mark Twain]] and the creator of ''[[The Three Investigators]]'', [[Robert Arthur (writer)|Robert Arthur]].

'''Anacondas''' (Jibóia and Sucuri, local names) are three species of aquatic [[boa]] inhabiting the swamps and rivers of the dense forests of tropical [[South America]] as well as the southern swamps of the island of [[Trinidad]] .

There are two possible origins for the word 'anaconda': It is perhaps an alteration of the [[Sinhalese]] word 'henakanday', meaning 'whip snake', or more likely, the [[Tamil]] word 'anaikolra', which means 'elephant killer', as early [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers in South America referred to the anaconda as 'matatoro', or 'bull killer'. It is unclear how the name originated so far from the snake's native habitat, it is likely due to its vague similarity to the large [[Asia]]n [[python]]s.&lt;sup&gt;[http://news2.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/photogalleries/0802_snakes1.html]&lt;/sup&gt;

Two species are well-known:

* The '''Green Anaconda''' (''[[Eunectes murinus]]''), which has been reported at over 10 meters (32.8 feet) in length (although most are considerably smaller). Although shorter than the longest recorded species, the [[Reticulated python|Reticulated Python]], it is considerably heavier. In fact, it is the heaviest [[snake]] species in existence. It can weigh 250 kg (551 pounds) and have a girth of more than 30 cm (11.8 inches) in diameter. Females are larger than males, averaging 22-26 feet and 12-16 feet respectively.  These are found mainly in northern [[South America]], in [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], northern [[Bolivia]], northeast [[Peru]], [[Guyana]], and [[Trinidad]]. Although charismatic, very little information was known about the anacondas until [[1992]] when the first study (and so far the only) was made on the field biology of this species in the Venezuelan [[llanos]] by Dr. Jesus Rivas. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.anacondas.org]&lt;/sup&gt;  

* The '''Yellow Anaconda''' (''[[Eunectes notaeus]]''), which reaches a relatively smaller average adult length of 3 metres (9.8 feet). These live further south in Bolivia, [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], western Brazil, and northeast [[Argentina]].

The third lesser known species is:

* The '''Dark-Spotted''' or '''Deschauense's Anaconda''' (''[[Eunectes deschauenseei]]'') found in northeast Brazil.

''Eunectes murinus'' (formerly called ''Boa murina'') differs from [[Boa]] by the snout being covered with shields instead of small scales, the inner of the three nasal shields being in contact with that of the other side. The general colour is dark olive-[[brown]], with large oval [[black]] spots arranged in two alternating rows along the back, and with smaller white-eyed spots along the sides. The belly is whitish, spotted with black spots. The anaconda combines an arboreal with an aquatic life, and feeds chiefly upon [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s and [[caiman]], mostly during the night. It lies submerged in the water, with only a small part of its head above the surface, waiting for any suitable prey, or it establishes itself upon the branches of a tree which overhangs the water or the track of game.

Like almost all boas, anacondas give birth to live young.

== Giant Anacondas ==

The largest known anacondas measure about 10.6 meters (30.7 feet) long, but unverified reports of much larger snakes have occasionally been made.

One notable account was reported by adventurer [[Percy Fawcett]]. In [[1906]], Fawcett wrote that he had shot and wounded an anaconda in South America; he reported the snake measured some 18.9 meters (62 feet) from nose to tail. 

Once publicized, Fawcett’s account of the giant snake was widely ridiculed, although he insisted his account was both truthful and accurate. [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] came to his defense arguing that Fawcett was generally honest and reliable when relating things. Furthermore, Heuvelmans noted that mainstream experts were repeatedly forced to revise their limits regarding the maximum size of snakes when confronted with specimens that defied the generally-accepted estimates. At one point in time, 6 meters (20 feet) in length was the widely-accepted maximum size of an anaconda.  These giant snakes are very capable of killing and consuming an adult human being. 

When it sheds, an adult anaconda relieves itself of an average of 2 pounds of skin. An anaconda's skin can stretch up to 30% larger than the original size of the snake.

== In captivity ==

Anacondas have a reputation for bad temperament; that plus the massive size of the green species mean that anacondas are comparatively less popular as pets than other boas, but they are fairly commonly available in the exotic pet trade, with the exception of ''E. deschauenseei''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the Christian holiday. For other meanings see [[All Saints (disambiguation)]] and [[All Hallows (disambiguation)]]''
[[Image:Wszystkich swietych cmentarz.jpg|thumb|right|300px|All Saints in Poland]]
The [[festival]] of '''All Saints''', also sometimes known as &quot;All Hallows,&quot; or &quot;Hallowmas,&quot; is a feast celebrated in their honour.  '''All Saints''' is also a Christian formula invoking all the faithful [[saint]]s and [[martyr]]s, known or unknown.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] holiday (''Festum omnium sanctorum'') falls on [[November 1]], followed by [[All Souls Day]] on [[November 2]], and is a [[Holy Day of Obligation]], with a [[vigil]] and an [[Octave (disambiguation)|octave]]. The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Church's '''All Saints''' is the first Sunday after [[Pentecost]] and as such marks the close of the [[Easter]] season.

Common commemorations by several churches of the deaths of martyrs began to be celebrated in the 4th century.  The first trace of a general celebration is attested in [[Antioch]] on the Sunday after [[Pentecost]]. This custom is also referred to in the 74th homily of [[John Chrysostom]] ([[407]]) and is maintained to the present day in the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Church.  

The date of festival was changed to November 1 by [[Pope Gregory III]] ([[731]]&amp;ndash;[[741]]) to coincide with the ancient [[Celts |Celtic]] New Year's festival [[Samhain]]. He designated November 1 as the date of the anniversary of the consecration of a chapel in St. Peter's for the relics &quot;of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors, of all the just made perfect who are at rest throughout the world&quot;.  By the time of the reign of [[Charlemagne]], the November festival of All Saints was widely celebrated. November 1 was decreed a day of obligation by the [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Louis the Pious]] in [[835]] issued &quot;at the instance of [[Pope Gregory IV]] and with the assent of all the bishops.&quot; 

In [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[Mexico]], ''ofrendas'' (offerings) are made on this day. In Spain, the play [[Don Juan Tenorio]] is traditionally performed.  In [[Portugal]] and [[France]], people offer flowers to dead relatives. In [[Poland]] and [[Germany]], the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives.  In the [[Philippines]], the day is spent visiting the graves of deceased relatives, where they offer prayers, lay flowers, and light candles, often in a picnic-like atmosphere.  In English speaking  countries, the festival is celebrated with the hymn &quot;For All the Saints&quot;, set to music by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].

The festival was retained after the [[Reformation]] in the calendar of the [[Church of England]] and in many [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches. In the Lutheran churches, such as the [[Church of Sweden]], it assumes a role of general commemoration of the dead (similar to the ''All Souls'' commemoration in the Eastern Orthodox Church that takes place two Saturdays before the beginning of [[Lent]]). In the [[Holidays in Sweden|Swedish calendar]], the observance takes place on the first Saturday of November.  In many Lutheran Churches however, the festival has fallen into disuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Altaic''' is a proposed [[Language families and languages|language family]] which includes 60 [[language]]s spoken by about 250 million people, mostly in and around [[Central Asia]] and the [[Far East]]. The relationships among these languages remain a matter of debate among historical linguists. Some scholars consider the obvious similarity between these languages as genetically inherited; others propose the idea of the [[Sprachbund]].

Its proponents traditionally considered it to include [[Korean language|Korean]], the [[Turkic languages]], the [[Mongolic languages]], the [[Tungusic languages]] (or Manchu-Tungus), and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. [[Ainu language|Ainu]] has occasionally been suggested as a member of Altaic, but that hypothesis is generally rejected.  Castrén (1862) put forward a similar view, but classified Turkic with what we would now call [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]. In 1857 [[Anton Boller]] suggested adding Korean and Japanese; for Korean, G. J. Ramstedt and E. D. Polivanov put forward more etymologies in the 1920's. Korean has commonly been linked to [[Japonic_languages|Japonic]], and in [[1971]], [[Roy Miller]] suggested relating it to both Korean and Altaic.  These suggestions have been taken up and developed by various historical linguists such as [[John Whitman]], [[Sergei Starostin]], and [[Alexander Vovin]] (who now rejects a genetic connection between Korean and Japanese).

There have been  some attempts to extend the Altaic family borders by including Ainu (e.g., Street 1962, Patrie 1982), [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]], or [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], but these proposals have been rejected by the majority of scholars.

==Controversy==

There are two main schools of thought about the Altaic theory. One is that the proposed constituent language families (Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic in the basic theory, with the addition of Korean and Japanese in extended versions) are genetically or &quot;divergently&quot; related by descent from a common ancestor, &quot;Proto-Altaic.&quot; The other school rejects this theory (so it is often called the &quot;Anti-Altaic&quot; school) and argues that the member languages are related by convergence (mainly loan influence).

The Altaic theory is claimed by its opponents to be based mainly on typological similarities, such as [[vowel harmony]], lack of [[grammatical gender]], an [[agglutinative]] typology, and [[loanword]]s.  In fact, its proponents have put together a large variety of grammatical, lexical, and syntactic regular correspondences between the sub-groups of Altaic (e.g., Ramstedt, [[Nicholas Poppe|Poppe]], Martin, Starostin).  However, its opponents explain these as [[loanword]]s, mutual influence, or [[convergence]], arguing that, although the Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic families do have similarities, they are the result of intensive borrowing and long contact among speakers. 

The Altaic theory is highly controversial. While some support it, others (e.g., Doerfer 1963) do not regard Altaic as a valid group and see it as three (or more) separate language families. Other linguists, such as [[Bernard Comrie]] (1992, 2003), argue that Altaic may be part of a larger grouping, such as [[Nostratic]] or [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]].  In contrast, [[J. Marshall Unger]] (1990) believes that languages such as Korean and Japanese may be part of a &quot;macro-Tungusic&quot; family. Vovin rejected the claim for a Koreo-Japonic branch of Altaic on the basis that they have no [[comparative_method|shared innovation]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Austrian German''' is any variety of the [[German language]] spoken in [[Austria]]. There is no unitary Austrian [[language]], but a variety of [[High Germanic languages|High German]] [[dialect]]s are spoken. Besides the Germanic languages discussed here, [[minority language]]s such as [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are spoken in parts of the country.

==Overview== 
* [[Standard German]], called ''&quot;High German&quot;'' (German: ''standardsprache'' (by philologists), generally (incorrectly) referred to as ''Hochdeutsch'') in Austria.
* [[Vorarlbergerisch]], spoken in [[Vorarlberg]], is an [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialect similar to [[Swiss German]].
* All other dialects belong to the [[Austro-Bavarian]] group, which is a common language throughout much of the country.

==Subgroups==
Ordinarily, the latter dialects are considered to belong either to the [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] subgroups, with the latter encompassing the languages of the [[Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], and [[Styria (state)|Styria]] and the former including the dialects of [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and [[Lower Austria]]. The dialect spoken in Vorarlberg is more closely related to [[Swiss German]] than it is to other Austrian dialects, so Austrians from outside Vorarlberg normally cannot understand it.

==Intercomprehensiblity and regional accents==
While strong forms of the various dialects are not normally comprehensible to Northern [[Germany|Germans]], there is virtually no communication barrier to speakers from [[Bavaria]]. The [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are more intelligible to speakers of Standard German than the [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] dialects of [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]. [[Viennese language|Viennese]], the Austro-Bavarian dialect of [[Vienna]], is most frequently used in [[Germany]] for impersonations of the typical inhabitant of Austria. The people of [[Graz]], the capital of [[Styria (state)|Styria]], speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western [[Styria (state)|Styria]].

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and it is very easy for an Austrian after a few spoken words to judge which  Austrian dialect someone speaks. However, if it goes into the dialects of the deeper valleys of [[Tyrol]], sometimes even other Tyroleans are helpless to understand the dialect. Speakers from the different [[States of Austria|states]] of Austria can usually easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), with those of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria (state)|Styria]], [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and the Tyrol being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking [[Standard German]], can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener. 

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where in the past many speakers were bilingual with [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] period, particularly from what is today the [[Czech Republic]]. 

Interestingly, the geographic borderlines between the different accents coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border to [[Bavaria]], with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the similarities in the language as such.

==Standard German in Austria==
With German being a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian dialects should not be confused with the variety of [[Standard German]] spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of [[Germany]] or [[Switzerland]]. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in [[culinary]] terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and [[administration|administrative]] and [[law|legal]] language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German [[nation-state]] in the late [[19th century]] and its manifold particular traditions.

Austrians speaking Standard German can almost always be recognised by their accent, much more so than speakers from most regions of [[Germany]].

When Austria became a member of the European Union, the Austrian variety of the German language (limited to 23 agricultural terms) was “protected” in the so-called Protocol no. 10 regarding the use of specific Austrian terms of the German language in the framework of the European Union, which forms part of the Austrian EU accession treaty. Austrian German is the only variety of a pluricentric language recognised under international law / EU primary law. All facts concerning “Protocol no. 10” are documented in Markhardt, Heidemarie: Das österreichische Deutsch im Rahmen der EU, Peter Lang, 2005.
==Influence of popular culture==
Dialects are receding in Austria as they are in some other areas of [[Europe]], but it can safely be said that they are more persistent than in most of Germany. Dialects are frequently used in TV series or movies in situation where it is appropriate for the particular character and situation. A classic example of a strong form of Viennese working-class dialect, for example, would be ''[[Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter]]''. However, strong varieties of dialect are not used quite as much as, for example, in Switzerland. For example, educated people in Vienna usually speak a very slight form of dialect or simply Standard German, but with the characteristic Viennese accent and, where it exists, particular Austrian and Viennese vocabulary.

A good reference for the Austrian, Bavarian and other German dialects are the dialect (&quot;Mundart&quot;) editions of [[Asterix]] and [[Obelix]] comic books which are available in [[Viennese language|Viennese]] (three editions with different dialects from inside [[Vienna]]) and at least one for the common Tyrolean dialect and one for a deep Styrian dialect.

      <comment>/* Results requiring ¬AC */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''axiom of choice''', or '''AC''', is an [[axiom]] of [[set theory]]. It was formulated in [[1904]] by [[Ernst Zermelo]].  While it was originally controversial, it is now used without embarrassment by most mathematicians.  However, there are still schools of mathematical thought, primarily within set theory, that either reject the axiom of choice, or even investigate consequences of axioms inconsistent with AC.

Intuitively speaking, AC says that given a collection of bins, each containing at least one object, then exactly one object from each bin can be picked and gathered in another bin - even if there are [[infinite]]ly many bins, and there is no &quot;rule&quot; for which object to pick from each.

== Statement ==

The axiom of choice states:
:Let ''X'' be a [[set]] of [[non-empty]] sets. Then we can [[choice function|choose]] a member from each set in ''X''.
Stated more formally:
:Let ''X'' be a set of non-empty sets. Then there exists a [[choice function]] ''f'' defined on ''X''. In other words, there exists a function ''f'' defined on ''X'', such that for each set ''s'' in ''X'', ''f''(''s'') is an element of ''s''.
Another formulation of the axiom of choice states:
:Given any set of mutually disjoint non-empty sets, there exists at least one set that contains exactly one element in common with each of the non-empty sets.

== Usage ==

Until the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly. For example, after having established that the set ''X'' contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said &quot;let ''F(s)'' be one of the members of ''s'' for all ''s'' in ''X''.&quot;  In general, it is impossible to prove that ''F'' exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until Zermelo.

Not every situation requires the axiom of choice.  For finite sets ''X'', the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory.  In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box.  Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on.  There are only finitely many boxes, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end.  The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on.  (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of [[mathematical induction]].)

For certain infinite sets ''X'', it is also possible to avoid the axiom of choice.  For example, suppose that the elements of ''X'' are sets of natural numbers.  Every nonempty set of natural numbers has a least element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it takes each set to the least element of that set.  This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set and we can write down an explicit expression that tells us what value our choice function takes.  Any time it is possible to specify such an explicit choice, the axiom of choice is unnecessary.

The difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set.  If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our set exists?  For example, suppose that ''X'' is the set of all non-empty subsets of the [[real number]]s.  First we might try to proceed as if ''X'' were finite.  If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because ''X'' is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we will never be able to produce a choice function for all of ''X''.  So that won't work.  Next we might try the trick of specifying the least element from each set.  But some subsets of the real numbers don't have least elements.  For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: If ''x'' is in (0,1), then so is ''x''/2, and ''x''/2 is always strictly smaller than ''x''.  So taking least elements doesn't work, either.

The reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are [[well-order]]ed: Every subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element.  Perhaps if we were clever we might say, &quot;Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering.  Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering.&quot;  The problem then becomes constructing such an ordering, and it turns out that every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice is true.

A proof requiring the axiom of choice is always [[nonconstructive proof|nonconstructive]]: even if the proof produces an object then it is impossible to say exactly what that object is.  Consequently, while the axiom of choice asserts that there is a well-ordering of the real numbers, it does not give us an example of one.  Yet the reason why we chose above to well-order the real numbers was so that for each set in ''X'', we could explicitly choose an element of that set.  If we cannot write down the well-ordering we are using, then our choice is not very explicit.  This is one of the reasons why some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice.  For example, [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]] posit that all existence proofs should be totally explicit; it should be possible to construct anything that exists.  They reject the axiom of choice because it asserts the existence of an object without telling what it is.

== Independence of AC ==

By work of [[Kurt Gödel]] and [[Paul Cohen]], the axiom of choice is [[logically independent]] of the other axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF).  This means that neither it nor its negation can be proven to be true in ZF.  Consequently, assuming the axiom of choice, or its negation, will never lead to a contradiction that could not be obtained without that assumption.

So the decision whether or not it is appropriate to make use of the axiom of choice in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory.  The decision must be made on other grounds.

One argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it: using it cannot hurt (cannot result in contradiction) and makes it possible to prove some propositions that otherwise could not be proved.

The axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of ZF.  For example, the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZF plus the axiom of choice (ZFC).  However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.

One reason that some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of some bizarre counter-intuitive objects.  An example of this is the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] which says in effect that it is possible to &quot;carve up&quot; the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotation and translation, reassemble the pieces into two balls each with the same volume as the original.  Note that the proof, like all proofs involving the axiom of choice, is an existence proof only: it does not tell us how to carve up the unit sphere to make this happen, it simply tells us that it can be done.

On the other hand, the [[negation]] of the axiom of choice is also bizarre.  For example, the statement that for any two sets ''S'' and ''T'', the [[cardinality]] of ''S'' is less than or equal to the cardinality of ''T'' or the cardinality of ''T'' is less than or equal to the cardinality of ''S'' is equivalent to the axiom of choice.  Put differently, if the axiom of choice is false, then there are sets ''S'' and ''T'' of incomparable size: neither can be mapped in a one-to-one fashion onto a subset of the other.

A third possibility is to prove theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation, a tactic preferred in constructive mathematics.  Such statements will be true in any [[model theory|model]] of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model.  This renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its negation undecidable.  For example, under such an assumption, the Banach–Tarski paradox is neither true nor false: It is impossible to construct a decomposition of the unit ball which can be reassembled into two unit balls, and it is also impossible to prove that it can't be done.  However, the Banach–Tarski paradox can be rephrased as a statement about models of ZF by saying, &quot;In any model of ZF in which AC is true, the Banach–Tarski paradox is true.&quot;  Similarly, all the statements listed below under [[#Results requiring AC|Results requiring AC]] are undecidable in ZF, but since each is provable in any model of ZFC, there are models of ZF in which each statement is true.

== Weaker forms of AC ==

There are several weaker statements which are not equivalent to the axiom of choice, but which are closely related.  A simple one is the [[axiom of countable choice]], which states that a choice function exists for any countable set ''X''.  This usually suffices when trying to make statements about the real numbers, for example, because the rational numbers, which are countable, form a dense subset of the reals.  See also the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]], the [[ultrafilter lemma]], the [[axiom of dependent choice]], and the [[Uniformization (set theory)|axiom of uniformization]].

== Results requiring AC (or weaker forms) ==

One of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that it shows up. There are also a remarkable number of important statements that, assuming the axioms of ZF but neither AC nor ¬AC, are equivalent to the axiom of choice.  The most important among them are [[Zorn's lemma]] and the [[well-ordering theorem]]: every set can be well-ordered.  In fact, Zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering principle.  Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC).  Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.

* [[Set theory]]
** Any [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[countable|countably many]] countable sets is itself countable.
** If the set ''A'' is [[infinite]], then there exists an [[injective function|injection]] from the [[natural number]]s '''N''' to ''A''.
** If the set ''A'' is infinite, then ''A'' and ''A''×''A'' have the same [[cardinality]]. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** [[Trichotomy]]: If two sets are given, then they either have the same cardinality, or one has a smaller cardinality than the other. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** The product of any nonempty family of nonempty sets is nonempty. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** Every infinite [[determinacy#Basic notions|game]] &lt;math&gt;G(T,X)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is either [[open set|open]] or [[closed set|closed]] is [[determinacy#Basic notions|determined]].

* [[Measure theory]]
** The [[Vitali set|Vitali theorem]] on the existence of [[non-measurable set]]s.
** The [[Hausdorff paradox]].
** The [[Banach–Tarski paradox]].

* [[Algebra]]
** Every [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** Every unital [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] other than the trivial ring contains a [[maximal ideal]].

== Results requiring ¬AC ==

There are models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false.  We will abbreviate &quot;Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the negation of the axiom of choice&quot; by ZF¬C.  For certain models of ZF¬C, it is possible to prove the negation of some standard facts.
Note that any model of ZF¬C is also a model of ZF, so for each of the following statements, there exists a model of ZF in which that statement is true.

*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a function ''f'' from the real numbers to the real numbers such that ''f'' is not continuous at ''a'', but for any sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converging to ''a'', lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; f(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')=f(a).
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which real numbers are a countable union of countable sets.
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a field with no algebraic closure.
*In all models of ZF¬C there is a vector space with no basis.
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a vector space with two bases of different cardinalities.

For proofs, see Thomas Jech, ''The Axiom of Choice'', American Elsevier Pub. Co., New York, 1973.

*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which every set in R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[measurable]].  Thus it is possible to exclude counterintuitive results like the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] which are provable in ZFC.  Furthermore, this is possible whilst assuming the [[Axiom of dependent choice]], which is weaker than AC but sufficient to develop most of [[real analysis]].
*In all models of ZF¬C, the [[Continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] does not hold.

== Results requiring choice in intuitionistic logic, though not classically ==
Interestingly, in various varieties of [[constructive logic]] (in particular, [[intuitionistic logic]]) in which the [[law of excluded middle]] is not assumed, the assumption of the axiom of choice is sufficient to obtain the law of excluded middle as a theorem. To see this, for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P\,,&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;U\,&lt;/math&gt; be the set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \{0, 1\} : (x = 0) \vee P\}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; be the set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \{0, 1\} : (x = 1) \vee P\}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Set-builder notation]]). By the axiom of choice, there will exist a choice function &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; for the set &lt;math&gt;\{U, V\}\,&lt;/math&gt; (note that, although the axiom of choice isn't classically required in order to obtain choice functions for finite sets, it is necessary here in intuitionistic logic). Since &lt;math&gt;f(U) \in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(V) \in V&lt;/math&gt;, this implies &lt;math&gt;[(f(U) = 0) \vee P] \wedge [(f(V) = 1) \vee P]&lt;/math&gt;, which implies &lt;math&gt;f(U) \neq f(V) \vee P&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;U = V = \{0, 1\}\,&lt;/math&gt;, it must be that &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f(U) = f(V)\,&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f(U) \neq f(V) \vee P&lt;/math&gt; would imply &lt;math&gt;\neg P \vee P&lt;/math&gt;. As this could be done for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt;, this completes the proof that the axiom of choice implies the law of the excluded middle.

The above proof is not valid in all intuitionistic deductive systems.  For example, in the [[intuitionistic type theory]] of [[Per Martin-Löf]], the axiom of choice is a theorem, yet excluded middle is not.

[[Image:Checa-HunCharge.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Huns]], led by Attila (right, foreground), ride into [[Italy]].]]

'''Attila the Hun''' ([[Old Norse]]: ''Atle, Atli''; [[Middle High German]]: ''Etzel''; ca. [[406]]&amp;ndash;[[453]] [[Anno Domini|AD]]) was the last and most powerful king of the [[Huns]]. &lt;!--He was from [[Bulgars]] [[clan]] of [[Dulo]]. This information looks bogus. References please--&gt; He reigned over what was then [[Europe]]'s largest [[empire]], from [[434]] until his death. His empire stretched from [[Central Europe]] to the [[Black Sea]] and from the [[Danube|Danube River]] to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. During his rule he was among the direst enemies of the Eastern and Western [[Roman Empire]]s: he invaded the [[Balkans]] twice and encircled [[Constantinople]] in the second invasion. He marched through [[Gaul]] (later [[France]]) as far as [[Orleans]] before being turned back at [[Battle of Chalons|Chalons]]; and he drove the western emperor [[Valentinian III]] from his [[capital]] at [[Ravenna]] in [[452]].

Though his empire died with him and he left no remarkable [[legacy]], he has become a legendary figure in the [[history of Europe]]. In much of [[Western Europe]], he is remembered as the epitome of cruelty and rapacity. In contrast, some histories lionize him as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three [[Norse saga]]s.

==Background and beginnings==
:''Main article: [[Huns]]''

The European [[Huns]] are often thought to have been a western extension of the [[Xiongnu]] (''Xiōngnú''), (匈奴) n., a group of [[nomad]] tribes from north-eastern [[China]] and [[Central Asia]]. These people achieved military superiority over their rivals (most of them highly cultured and civilized) by their state of readiness for combat, amazing mobility, and weapons like the [[Hun bow]].

Attila was born around 406. Nothing certain is known about his childhood; the supposition that at a young age he was already a capable leader and a capable warrior is reasonable but unknowable.

Following [[negotiation]] of peace terms in [[418]], the young Attila, at the age of 12, was sent as a child [[hostage]] to the Roman [[Royal court|court]] of Emperor [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]]. In return, the Huns received [[Flavius Aetius]], in a child hostage exchange arranged by the Romans.

Most likely the empire schooled Attila in its courts, customs and traditions and in its luxurious [[lifestyle]], in the hope that he would carry an appreciation of these things back to his own nation, thus serving to extend Roman influence. The Huns would probably have hoped that Attila would enhance [[espionage]] capabilities by the exchange. 

Attila attempted escape during his stay in Rome but failed. He turned his attention to an intense study of the empire while outwardly ceasing to struggle against his hostage status. He studied the internal and [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] of the Romans. He often secretly observed them in [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] conference with [[foreign minister]]s. He learned about [[leadership]], [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] and other essentials suited to future rulers and diplomats.

==Shared kingship==
[[Image:Huns empire.png|thumb|300px|left|The Hunnish empire stretched from the [[steppe]]s of Central Asia into modern [[Germany]], and from the Danube river to the Baltic Sea]]

By [[432]], the Huns were united under [[Ruga]]. In [[434]] Ruga died, leaving his [[nephew]]s Attila and [[Bleda]], the sons of his brother [[Mundjuk]], in control over all the united Hun tribes. At the time of their accession, the Huns were [[bargain]]ing with [[Theodosius II]]'s envoys over the return of several [[renegade]] tribes who had taken refuge within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at Margus (present-day [[Pozarevac|Požarevac]])  and, all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner, negotiated a successful [[treaty]]: the Romans agreed not only to return the fugitive tribes (who had been a welcome aid against the [[Vandals]]), but also to double their previous tribute of 350 Roman pounds (ca. 114.5 kg) of gold, open their markets to Hunnish traders, and pay a ransom of eight ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the empire and departed into the interior of the [[continent]], perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the [[walls of Constantinople]], building the city's first [[sea wall]], and to build up his border defenses along the Danube.

The Huns remained out of Roman sight for the next five years. During this time, they were conducting an [[invasion]] of the [[Persian Empire]]. However, in [[Armenia]], a Persian counterattack resulted in a defeat for Attila and Bleda, and they ceased their efforts to conquer Persia. In [[440]], they reappeared on the borders of the empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been arranged for by the treaty. Attila and Bleda threatened further war, claiming that the Romans had failed to fulfil their treaty obligations and that the [[bishop]] of Margus (not far from modern [[Belgrade]]) had crossed the Danube to ransack and desecrate the royal Hun graves on the Danube's north bank. They crossed the Danube and laid waste to [[Illyria]]n cities and forts on the river, among them, according to [[Priscus]], [[Viminacium]], which was a city of the [[Moesian]]s in Illyria. Their advance began at Margus, for when the Romans discussed handing over the offending bishop, he slipped away secretly to the barbarians and betrayed the city to them.

Theodosius had stripped the river's defenses in response to the Vandal [[Geiseric]]'s capture of [[Carthage]] in [[440]] and the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] [[Yazdegerd II of Persia|Yazdegerd II]]'s invasion of [[Armenia]] in [[441]]. This left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyria into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army, having sacked Margus and Viminacium, took Sigindunum (modern [[Belgrade]]) and [[Sirmium]] before halting its operations. A lull followed during [[442]], when Theodosius recalled his troops from [[North Africa]] and ordered a large new issue of coins to finance operations against the Huns. Having made these preparations, he thought it safe to refuse the Hunnish kings' demands.

Attila and Bleda responded by renewing their [[Military campaign|campaign]] in [[443]]. Striking along the Danube, they overran the military centers of [[Ratiara]] and successfully besieged Naissus (modern [[Niš]]) with [[battering ram]]s and rolling towers&amp;mdash;military sophistication that was new in the Hun repertory&amp;mdash;then pushing along the [[Nisava]] they took Serdica ([[Sofia]]), Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]]), and [[Arcadiopolis]]. They encountered and destroyed the Roman force outside Constantinople and were only halted by their lack of [[siege|siege equipment]] capable of breaching the city's massive walls. Theodosius admitted defeat and sent the court official [[Anatolius]] to negotiate peace terms, which were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (ca. 1,963 kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (ca. 687 kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 ''solidi''.

Their desires contented for a time, the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire. According to [[Jordanes]] (following [[Priscus]]), sometime during the peace following the Huns' withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around [[445]]), Bleda died (killed by his brother, according to the classical sources), and Attila took the throne for himself. Now undisputed lord of the Huns, he again turned towards the eastern Empire.

==Sole ruler==
Constantinople suffered major [[natural disaster|natural]] (and man-made) disasters in the years following the Huns' departure: bloody [[riot]]s between the [[Chariot racing#Byzantine chariot racing|racing factions]] of the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]; [[Pandemic|plague]]s in [[445]] and [[446]], the second following a [[famine]]; and a four-month series of [[earthquake]]s which levelled much of the [[defensive wall|city wall]] and killed thousands, causing another [[epidemic]]. This last struck in [[447]], just as Attila, having consolidated his power, again rode south into the empire through [[Moesia]]. The [[Roman military history|Roman army]], under the [[Goths|Gothic]] ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Arnegisclus]], met him on the river [[Vid]] and was defeated&amp;mdash;though not without inflicting heavy losses. The Huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the Balkans as far as [[Thermopylae]]; Constantinople itself was saved by the intervention of the prefect [[Flavius Constantinus]], who organized the citizenry to reconstruct the earthquake-damaged walls, and in some places to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old. An account of this invasion survives:

: ''The barbarian nation of the Huns, which was in [[Thrace]], became so great that more than a hundred cities were captured and Constantinople almost came into danger and most men fled from it. … And there were so many murders and blood-lettings that the dead could not be numbered. Ay, for they took captive the [[churches]] and [[monasteries]] and slew the monks and maidens in great numbers.''
::&amp;mdash; Callinicus, in his ''Life of Saint Hypatius''
[[Image:MorThanFeastofAttila.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Mór Than]]'s painting ''The Feast of Attila'', based on a fragment of [[Priscus]] (depicted at right, dressed in white and holding his history):&lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;&quot;When evening began to draw in, torches were lighted, and two barbarians came forward in front of Attila and sang songs which they had composed, hymning his victories and his great deeds in war. And the banqueters gazed at them, and some were rejoiced at the songs, others became excited at heart when they remembered the wars, but others broke into tears&amp;mdash;those whose bodies were weakened by time and whose spirit was compelled to be at rest.&quot; &lt;/small&gt;]]

Attila demanded, as a condition of peace, that the Romans should continue paying [[tribute]] in gold&amp;mdash;and evacuate a strip of land stretching three hundred miles east from Sigindunum ([[Belgrade]]) and up to a hundred miles south of the Danube. Negotiations continued between Roman and Hun for approximately three years. The [[historian]] [[Priscus]] was sent as emissary to Attila's encampment in [[448]], and the fragments of his reports preserved by Jordanes offer the best glimpse of Attila among his numerous wives, his [[Scythia]]n fool, and his [[Moors|Moor]]ish [[dwarf]], impassive and unadorned amid the splendor of the courtiers:

:''A luxurious meal, served on [[silver]] plate, had been made ready for us and the barbarian guests, but Attila ate nothing but meat on a wooden trencher. In everything else, too, he showed himself temperate; his cup was of wood, while to the guests were given goblets of gold and silver. His dress, too, was quite simple, affecting only to be clean. The sword he carried at his side, the latchets of his Scythian shoes, the bridle of his horse were not adorned, like those of the other Scythians, with gold or gems or anything costly.''

&quot;The floor of the room was covered with woollen mats for walking on,&quot; Priscus noted.

During these three years, according to a legend recounted by Jordanes, Attila discovered the  &quot;Sword of Mars&quot;:
:''The historian Priscus says it was discovered under the following circumstances: &quot;When a certain shepherd beheld one heifer of his flock limping and could find no cause for this wound, he anxiously followed the trail of blood and at length came to a sword it had unwittingly trampled while nibbling the grass. He dug it up and took it straight to Attila. He rejoiced at this gift and, being ambitious, thought he had been appointed ruler of the whole world, and that through the sword of Mars supremacy in all wars was assured to him.''
::&amp;mdash; Jordanes, ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'' ch. XXXV [http://www.boudicca.de/jordanes3-e.htm (e-text)]

Later scholarship would identify this legend as part of a pattern of sword worship common among the nomads of the [[Central Asia]]n steppes.

==Attila in the west==
[[Image:AttilaTheHun.jpg|frame|An inaccurate sketch of Attila the Hun, probably from the [[19th century]]&lt;!-- my guess --mirv --&gt;, depicts him as [[European]], though the only extant description of his appearance by a Roman court historian states that Atilla had &quot;a flat nose, swarthy dark complexion, broad chest, short stature and small eyes, but full of confidence&quot; among his features, suggesting physical features common among [[Mongolia]]ns.]]

As late as [[450]], Attila had proclaimed his intent to attack the powerful [[Visigoth]] kingdom of [[Toulouse]] in [[military alliance|alliance]] with Emperor [[Valentinian III]]. He had previously been on good terms with the western Empire and its ''[[de facto]]'' ruler [[Flavius Aëtius]]&amp;mdash;Aetius had spent a brief [[exile]] among the Huns in [[433]], and the troops Attila provided against the [[Goths]] and [[Bagaudae]] had helped earn him the largely honorary title of ''magister militum'' in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of [[Geiseric]], who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila's plans.

However Valentinian's sister [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], in order to escape her forced betrothal to a [[Roman Senate|senator]], had sent the Hunnish king a plea for help&amp;mdash;and her [[engagement ring|ring]]&amp;mdash;in the spring of 450. Though Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, Attila chose to interpret her message as such; he accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as [[dowry]]. When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of his mother [[Galla Placidia]] convinced him to exile, rather than kill, Honoria; he also wrote to Attila strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila, not convinced, sent an embassy to [[Ravenna]] to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his.

Meanwhile, Theodosius having died in a riding accident, his successor [[Marcian]] cut off the Huns' tribute in late 450; and multiple invasions, by the Huns and by others, had left the Balkans with little to plunder. The king of the [[Salian Franks]] had died, and the succession struggle between his two sons drove a rift between Attila and Aetius: Attila supported the elder son, while Aetius supported the younger{{ref|rift}}. [[J.B. Bury]] believes that Attila's intent, by the time he marched west, was to extend his kingdom&amp;mdash;already the strongest on the continent&amp;mdash;across [[Gaul]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] shore{{ref|atlantic}}. By the time Attila had gathered his [[vassal]]s&amp;mdash;[[Gepids]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Rugians]], [[Scirians]], [[Heruls]], [[Thuringians]], [[Alans]], [[Burgundians]], et al.&amp;mdash;and begun his march west, he had declared intent of alliance both with the Visigoths and with the Romans.

In [[451]], his arrival in [[Belgica]] with an army exaggerated by Jordanes to half a million strong soon made his intent clear. On [[April 7]] he captured [[Metz]], and Aetius moved to oppose him, gathering troops from among the [[Franks]], the [[Burgundians]], and the [[Celts]]. A mission by [[Avitus]], and Attila's continued westward advance, convinced the Visigoth king [[Theodoric I]] (Theodorid) to ally with the Romans. The combined armies reached [[Orleans]] ahead of Attila{{ref|orleans}}, thus checking and turning back the Hunnish advance. Aetius gave chase and caught the Huns at a place usually assumed to be near [[Châlons-en-Champagne]]. The two armies clashed in the [[Battle of Chalons]], whose outcome commonly, though erroneously, is attributed to be a victory for the Gothic-Roman alliance. Theodoric was killed in the fighting. Aetius failed to press his advantage, and the alliance quickly disbanded. Attila withdrew to continue his campaign against Italy.

==Invasion of Italy and death==
Attila returned in [[452]] to claim his marriage to Honoria anew, invading and ravaging [[Italy]] along the way; his army sacked numerous cities and razed [[Aquileia]] completely, leaving no trace of it behind. Valentinian fled from [[Ravenna]] to [[Rome]]; Aetius remained in the field but lacked the strength to offer battle. Attila finally halted at the [[Po]], where he met an embassy including the [[prefect]] [[Trigetius]], the [[consul]] [[Aviennus]], and [[Pope Leo I]]. After the meeting he turned his army back, having claimed neither Honoria's hand nor the territories he desired.

[[Image:Leoattila-Raphael.jpg|thumb|275px|right|[[Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' shows Leo I, with [[Saint Peter]] and Saint Paul above him, going to meet Attila]]

Several explanations for his actions have been proffered. The [[Pandemic|plague]] and [[famine]] which coincided with his invasion may have caused his army to weaken, or the troops that Marcian sent across the Danube may have given him reason to retreat, or perhaps both. [[Priscus]] reports that superstitious fear of the fate of [[Alaric I|Alaric]]&amp;mdash;who died shortly after sacking Rome in [[410]]&amp;mdash;gave the Hun pause. [[Prosper of Aquitaine]]'s pious &quot;fable which has been represented by the pencil of [[Raphael]] and the chisel of [[Algardi]]&quot; (as [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] called it) says that the Pope, aided by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], convinced him to turn away from the city. Various historians (e.g. [[Isaac Asimov]]) have supposed that the embassy brought a large amount of gold to the Hunnish leader and persuaded him to abandon his campaign. 

Whatever his reasons, Attila left Italy and returned to his palace across the Danube. From there he planned to strike at Constantinople again and reclaim the tribute which Marcian had cut off. However, he died in the early months of [[453]]; the conventional account, from Priscus, says that on the night after a feast celebrating his latest marriage (to a beautiful Goth named [[Ildico]]), he suffered a severe [[nosebleed]] and choked to death in a stupor. An alternative to the nosebleed theory is that he succummed to internal bleeding after heavy drinking. His warriors, upon discovering his death, mourned him by cutting off their hair and gashing themselves with their swords so that, says Jordanes, &quot;the greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears, but with the blood of men.&quot; His horsemen galloped in circles around the silken tent when Attila lay in state, singing in his [[dirge]], according to [[Cassiodorus]] and Jordanes, &quot;Who can rate this as death, when none believes it calls for vengeance?&quot; then celebrating a ''[[strava]]'' over his burial place with great feasting. He was buried in a triple coffin&amp;mdash;of gold, silver, and iron&amp;mdash;with the spoils of his conquest, and his funeral party was killed to keep his burial place secret. After his death, he lived on as a legendary figure: the characters of ''Etzel'' in the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' and ''Atli'' in both the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' were both loosely based on his life.

An alternate story of his death, first recorded eighty years after the fact by the Roman chronicler [[Count Marcellinus]], reports: &quot;''Attila rex Hunnorum Europae orbator provinciae noctu mulieris manu cultroque confoditur.''&quot; (&quot;Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife.&quot;){{ref|marcellinus}} The ''Volsunga saga'' and the ''Poetic Edda'' claim that King Atli died at the hands of his wife [[Gudrun]].{{ref|atli_death}} Most scholars reject these accounts as no more than romantic fables, preferring instead the version given by Attila's contemporary Priscus.  The &quot;official&quot; account by Priscus, however, has recently come under renewed scrutiny by Michael A. Babcock (''The Night Attila Died: Solving the Murder of Attila the Hun'', Berkley Books, 2005 ISBN 0425202720). Based on detailed [[philological]] analysis, Babcock concludes that the account of natural death, given by Priscus, was an ecclesiastical &quot;cover story&quot; and that Emperor Marcian (who ruled the Eastern Roman Empire from [[450]]-[[457]]) was the political force behind Attila's death.

His sons [[Ellak]] (his appointed successor), [[Dengizik]], and [[Ernakh]] fought over the division of his legacy&amp;mdash;&quot;what warlike kings with their peoples should be apportioned to them by lot like a family estate&quot;  and, divided, were defeated and scattered the following year in the [[Battle of Nedao]] by the Gepids, under [[Ardaric]], whose pride was stirred by being treated with his people like chattel, and the Ostrogoths. Attila's empire did not outlast him.

==Appearance, character, and name==
[[Image:Atli.jpg|thumb|270px|left|Atilla. &lt;br&gt; From an illustration to the [[Poetic Edda]].]] 

The main source for information on Attila is [[Priscus]], a historian who traveled with [[Maximin]] on an embassy from Theodosius II in [[448]]. He describes the village the nomadic Huns had built and settled down in as the size of the great city with solid wooden walls. He described Attila himself as:

: ''&quot;short of stature, with a broad chest and a large head; his eyes were small, his beard thin and sprinkled with gray; and he had a flat nose and a swarthy complexion, showing the evidences of his origin.&quot;''

Attila's physical appearance was most likely that of an [[Eastern Asia|Eastern Asian]] or more specifically a [[Mongol]], or perhaps a mixture of this type and the Turkic peoples of [[Central Asia]]. Indeed, he probably exhibited the characteristic Eastern Asian facial features, which Europeans were not used to seeing, and so they often described him in harsh terms. 

Attila is known in Western history and tradition as the grim &quot;Scourge of God&quot;, and his name has become a byword for cruelty and [[Barbarian|barbarism]]. Some of this may arise from a conflation of his traits, in the popular imagination, with those perceived in later [[steppe]] warlords such as the [[Mongol]] [[Great Khan]] [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Timur|Tamerlane]]: all run together as cruel, clever, and sanguinary lovers of battle and pillage. The reality of his character may be more complex. The Huns of Attila's era had been mingling with Roman civilization for some time, largely through the Germanic ''[[foederati]]'' of the border&amp;mdash;so that by the time of Theodosius's embassy in 448, Priscus could identify [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], and [[Latin]] as the three common languages of the horde. Priscus also recounts his meeting with an eastern Roman captive who had so fully [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into the Huns' way of life that he had no desire to return to his former country, and the Byzantine historian's description of Attila's humility and simplicity is unambiguous in its admiration.

The historical context of Attila's life played a large part in determining his later public image: in the waning years of the western Empire, his conflicts with Aetius (often called the &quot;last of the Romans&quot;) and the strangeness of his culture both helped dress him in the mask of the ferocious barbarian and enemy of civilization, as he has been portrayed in any number of films and other works of art. The Germanic epics in which he appears offer more nuanced depictions: he is both a noble and generous ally, as [[Etzel]] in the ''Nibelungenlied'', and a cruel miser, as Atli in the ''Volsunga Saga'' and the ''Poetic Edda''. Some national histories, though, always portray him favorably; in [[Hungary]] and [[Turkey]] the names of Attila (sometimes as Atilla in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) and his last wife Ildikó remain popular to this day. In a similar vein, the Hungarian author [[Géza Gárdonyi]]'s novel ''A láthatatlan ember'' (published in English as ''Slave of the Huns'', and largely based on Priscus) offered a sympathetic portrait of Attila as a wise and beloved leader.

The name Attila may mean &quot;Little Father&quot; in Gothic (''atta'' &quot;father&quot; plus diminutive suffix ''-la'') as many Goths were known to serve under Attila. It could also be of pre-[[Turkish language|Turkish]] ([[Altaic languages|Altaic]]) origin (compare it with [[Ataturk|Atatürk]] and ''Alma-Ata'', now called [[Almaty]]). It most probably originates from ''atta'' (&quot;father&quot;) and ''il'' (&quot;land&quot;), meaning &quot;Land-Father&quot;. [[Atil]] was also the [[Altaic]] name of the present-day [[Volga]] river which may have given its name to Attila.

The '''Aegean Sea''' is an arm of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], located between the Greek peninsula and [[Asia Minor]]. It is connected to the [[Marmara Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] by the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Bosporus]].

== Etymology ==
In ancient times there were various explanations for the name Aegean. It was said to have been named after the town of [[Aegae]], or [[Aegea]], a queen of the [[Amazons]] who died in the sea, or [[Aegeus]], the father of [[Theseus]], who drowned himself in the sea when he thought his son had died. 

The [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the sea is {{Polytonic|Αἰγαῖον Πέλαγος}} (Aigaion Pelagos, [[Modern Greek language|Modern Greek]] Ejéon Pélaγos) and Ege Denizi in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. A possible etymology is a derivation from the dialect word {{Polytonic|αἶγες}} (aiges) &quot;waves&quot; ([[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]; metaphorical use of {{Polytonic|αἴξ}} (aix) &quot;goat&quot;), hence &quot;wavy sea&quot;, cf. also {{Polytonic|αἰγιαλός}} (aigialos) &quot;coast&quot;.

== History ==
In ancient times the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations - the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] of [[Crete]], and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] Civilization of the [[Peloponnese]]. Later arose the city-states of Athens and Sparta among many others that constituted the [[Hellenic Civilization]]. The Aegean Sea was later inhabited by [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Roman Republic|Romans]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Venice|Venetians]], the [[Seljuk Turks]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Aegean was the site of the original [[democracy|democracies]], and it allowed for contact between several diverse civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Aegeansea.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite Image]]
The [[Aegean islands]] can be simply divided into seven groups: the [[Thracian Sea]] group, the East Aegean group, the Northern [[Sporades]], the [[Cyclades]], the [[Saronic Islands]] (or [[Argo-Saronic Islands]]), the [[Dodecanese]] and Crete. The word ''[[archipelago]]'' was originally applied specifically to these islands. Many of the Aegean islands, or chains of islands, are actually extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to [[Chios]], another extends across [[Euboea]] to [[Samos Island|Samos]], and a third extends across the [[Peloponnese]] and [[Crete]] to [[Rhodes]], dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean. Many of the islands have safe harbours and bays, but navigation through the sea is generally difficult. Many of the islands are [[volcano|volcanic]], and [[marble]] and [[iron]] are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains. There are two islands of considerable size belonging to [[Turkey]] on the Aegean Sea: [[Bozcaada]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Τένεδος ''[[Tenedos]]'') and [[Gökçeada]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ίμβρος ''[[Imvros]]'').

The bays in gulfs counterclockwise includes on [[Crete]], the [[Mirabelli Gulf|Mirabelli]], [[Almyros Bay|Almyros]], [[Souda Bay|Souda]] and [[Gulf of Chania|Chania]] bays or gulfs, on the mainland the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west, the [[Saronic Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Petalies Gulf]] which connects with the [[South Euboic Sea]], the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] which connects with the [[North Euboic Sea]], the [[Thermian Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Chalkidiki]] Peninsula including the [[Cassandra Gulf|Cassandra]] and the [[Singitic Gulf]]s, northward the [[Strymonian Gulf|Strymonian]] Gulf and the [[Gulf of Kavala]] and the rest are in [[Turkey]]; [[Saros Gulf]], [[Edremit]] Gulf, Dikili Gulf, Çandarlı Gulf, [[İzmir]] Gulf, [[Kuşadası]] Gulf, Gökova Gulf, Güllük Gulf.

==Port towns==

The Aegean Sea has many ports especially on the islands, for ports, see the island chains or its gulfs and bays.

''This article describes the novel by Anthony Burgess. For other uses of the term '''Clockwork Orange''', see '[[Clockwork Orange (disambiguation)]]'.


'''''A Clockwork Orange''''' is a [[science fiction]] and [[dystopian]] [[1962]] [[novel]] by [[Anthony Burgess]], and forms the basis for the [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|1971 film adaptation]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. 

It is one of Burgess's &quot;terminal novels&quot;, written to provide posthumous income for his wife after Burgess had allegedly been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.

Burgess wrote that the title came from an old [[Cockney]] expression &quot;As queer as a clockwork orange.&quot; [[#References|&amp;sup1;]] Due to his time serving the British [[Colonial Office]] in [[Malaya]], Burgess thought that the phrase could be used to punningly refer to a mechanically responsive (clockwork) non-human (orang, [[Malay language|Malay]] for &quot;person&quot;). The Italian title, &quot;Un'Arancia ad Orologeria&quot; was interpreted to refer to a grenade. Burgess wrote in his later introduction, &quot;A Clockwork Orange Resucked,&quot; that a creature who can only perform good or evil is &quot;a clockwork orange&amp;mdash;meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by [[god (monotheism)|God]] or the [[Devil]].&quot;

In his essay &quot;Clockwork Oranges&quot;[[#References|&amp;sup2;]] he says that &quot;this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]], or mechanical, laws to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and sweetness.&quot; This title alludes to the protagonist's negatively conditioned responses to feelings of evil which prevent the exercise of his free will.

The book was partly inspired by an event in [[1944]], when Burgess' pregnant wife Lynne was robbed and beaten by four [[desertion |U.S. GI deserters]] in a [[London]] street, suffering a [[miscarriage]] and chronic [[gynecology|gynaecological]] problems[[#References|&amp;sup3;]].  According to Burgess, writing the novel was both a catharsis and an &quot;act of charity&quot; towards his wife's attackers - the story is narrated by and essentially sympathetic to one of the attackers rather than their victim.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
Set in the near future, the book centres around the life of the fifteen year old protagonist [[Alex DeLarge]]. Alex and his gang roam the streets at night, committing crimes purely for enjoyment.  The crimes described in the book increase in severity, from assault, to robbery, to a fight with rival gang, culminating when the gang breaks into the house of F.D. Alexander and rapes his wife. The gang returns to a bar where Alex hits one of his gang members, Dim, as punishment for Dim's rude behaviour towards a woman who was singing the chorus of ''[[Ode to Joy]]'', classical music being Alex's other passion, apart from violence. This sparks off a tense moment between the two gang members.

The next day, after fighting Dim and George to re-establish his control of the gang following the previous night's dispute Alex agrees, on Pete's suggestion, to rob a house in a rich part of town. Alex tries to persuade the woman living in the house to open the door. The woman refuses and calls the police as a precaution. He gains access to the house through a window, but is confronted by the defiant woman, who defends herself with unexpected strength, he goes for a bust of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and she scratches his face, he manages to knock her out with a silver statue he had previously taken. As he runs out the front door he is struck by Dim who runs off with the rest of the gang just as the police arrive. At the police station we learn that the woman has died.

In prison, Alex hears about an experimental rehabilitation programme called &quot;the Ludovico technique&quot;, which promises that the prisoner will be released upon completion of the two week treatment and will not commit crimes afterwards and manages to become the first patient. The Ludovico technique itself is a form of [[aversion therapy]], where Alex is given a drug that induces extreme nausea while being forced to watch graphically violent films. At the end of the treatment Alex is unable to carry out or even contemplate violent acts as doing so induces crippling nausea.

He is released from prison, but upon returning home he is rejected by his parents. Dejected, Alex contemplates suicide, going to the public library in order to discover what sort of poison he might take to end his life. There he is spotted by one of his former victims, who accompanied by his friends extracts his revenge. Alex is unable to strike back and the police is alerted. The police arrive, but they turn out to be Dim, and Billy Boy, the former leader of a rival gang. They take Alex, beat him up and dump him by the side of the road out in the country.

Alex stumbles to the nearest house for help, which turns out to be that of F.D. Alexander, whose wife Alex had raped and beaten earlier in the book. At first Alex is not recognised as he had always worn a mask, but the reader discovers that F.D. Alexander is in a wheel chair and his wife died from her injuries. Realising that Alex is the same person who had attacked him and his wife some years ago, F.D. Alexander drugs him, locks him in a room and plays Beethoven’s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] at full volume. Although previously his favourite piece of music the Ninth was also used as a soundtrack for one of the films that Alex was forced to watch as part of the Ludovico treatment, hence it produces the same nauseating effects on him. Unable to stand the pain Alex throws himself out of the window to try to kill himself. He survives the fall with broken bones and wakes up in hospital informed that his tormentors have been arrested and the Ludovico treatment reversed.

The final chapter begins identically to the first, Alex having formed a new gang a
