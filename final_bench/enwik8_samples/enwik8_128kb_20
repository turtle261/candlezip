xander continued on to conquer all the headwaters of the [[Indus River]]. 

East of Porus' kingdom, near the [[Ganges River]], was the powerful empire of [[Magadha]] ruled by the [[Nanda dynasty]]. Fearing the prospects of facing another powerful Indian army and exhausted by years of campaigning, his army mutinied at the [[Beas River|Hyphasis]] (modern Beas), refusing to march further east. Alexander, after the meeting with his officer, [[Coenus]], was convinced that it was better to return. Alexander was forced to turn south, conquering his way down the Indus to the Indian Ocean. He sent much of his army to [[Carmania]] (modern southern [[Iran]]) with his general [[Craterus]], and commissioned a fleet to explore the [[Persian Gulf]] shore under his admiral [[Nearchus]], while he led the rest of his forces back to Persia by the southern route through the [[Gedrosia]] (present day [[Makran]] in southern [[Pakistan]]).

===After India===
[[Image:Le Brun, Alexander and Porus.jpg|thumb|350px|''Alexander and [[Porus]]'' by [[Charles Le Brun]], [[1673]].]]

Discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed a number of them as examples on his way to Susa. As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send those over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedonia under Craterus, but his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of [[Opis]], refusing to be sent away and bitterly criticizing his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units. Alexander executed the ringleaders of the mutiny, but forgave the rank and file. In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, he held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Opis, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year.

His attempts to merge Persian culture with his Greek soldiers also included training a regiment of Persian boys in the ways of Macedonians. It is not certain that Alexander adopted the Persian royal title of ''[[shah|shahanshah]]'' (&quot;great king&quot; or 
&quot;king of kings&quot;). However, most historians believe that he did.

Alexander let it be known that he intended to launch a campaign against the tribes of Arabia. After they were subjugated, it was assumed that Alexander would turn westwards and attack [[Carthage]] and [[Italy]].

After traveling to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure, his closest friend and possible lover [[Hephaestion]] died of an illness. Alexander was distraught and on his return to Babylon, he fell ill and died.

==Alexander's marriages and sexuality==
Alexander's greatest emotional attachment is generally considered to have been to his companion, cavalry commander (''chiliarchos'') and probable lover, [[Hephaestion]]. They had most likely been best friends since childhood for Hephaestion too received his education at the court of Alexander's father. Hephaestion makes his appearance in history at the point when Alexander reaches [[Troy]]. There the two friends made sacrifices at the shrines of the two heroes [[Achilles]] and [[Patroclus]]; Alexander honoring Achilles, and Hephaestion honoring Patroclus. As [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] in his ''Varia Historia'' (12.7) claims, &quot;He thus intimated that he was the object of Alexander's love, as Patroclus was of Achilles.&quot;  Following Hephaestion's death, Alexander mourned him greatly, and did not eat for days.

Many have discussed Alexander's ambiguous sexuality. [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]] reports that, &quot;He scorned [feminine] sensual pleasures to such an extent that his mother was anxious lest he be unable to beget offspring.&quot; To encourage a relationship with a woman, King Philip and Olympias brought in a high-priced [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] [[hetaira|courtesan]] named Callixena.

Later in life, Alexander married several princesses of former Persian territories, [[Roxana]] of [[Bactria]], [[Statira]], daughter of Darius III, and [[Parysatis]], daughter of [[Ochus]]. He fathered two children, ([[Heracles (Macedon)|Heracles]]), born by his concubine [[Barsine]] (the daughter of satrap [[Artabazus of Phrygia]]) in [[327 BC]], and [[Alexander IV of Macedon]], born by Roxana shortly after his death in [[323 BC]].

Curtius maintains that Alexander also took as a lover &quot;[[Bagoas (courtier)|Bagoas]], a [[eunuch]] exceptional in beauty and in the very flower of boyhood, with whom Darius was intimate and with whom Alexander would later be intimate,&quot; (VI.5.23). Bagoas is the only one who is actually named as the ''eromenos'' &amp;mdash; the beloved &amp;mdash; of Alexander. Their relationship seems to have been well known among the troops, as [[Plutarch]] recounts an episode (also mentioned by [[Dicaearchus]]) during some festivities on the way back from India) in which his men clamor for him to openly kiss the young man: &quot;Bagoas [...] sat down close by him, which so pleased the Macedonians, that they made loud acclamations for him to kiss Bagoas, and never stopped clapping their hands and shouting till Alexander put his arms round him and kissed him.&quot; At this point in time, the troops present were all survivors of the crossing of the desert. Bagoas must have endeared himself to them by his courage and fortitude during that harrowing episode.  Whatever Alexander's relationship with Bagoas, it was no impediment to relations with his queen: six months after Alexander's death Roxana gave birth to his son and heir, Alexander IV. Besides Bagoas, Curtius mentions yet another possible lover of Alexander, Euxenippus, &quot;whose youthful grace filled him with enthusiasm&quot; (VII.9.19).

Allegations concerning Alexander's sexuality remain highly controversial and excite passions in some quarters. People of various national, ethnic and cultural origins regard him as their hero. Some argue that historical accounts describing Alexander's love for Hephaestion and Bagoas as sexual were written centuries after the fact, and thus it can never be established what the historical relationship between Alexander and his male companions were. Others argue that the same can be said about much of our information regarding Alexander. Such debates, however, are generally considered anachronistic by scholars of the period, who point out that the concept of homosexuality as understood today did not exist in [[Greco-Roman]] [[classical antiquity|antiquity]].  Sexual attraction between males was seen as a normal and universal part of [[human nature]] since it was believed that men were attracted to [[beauty]], an attribute of the young, regardless of gender. If Alexander's love life was transgressive, it was not for his love of beautiful youths but for his probable involvement with a man his own age, in a time when the standard model of male love was [[pederasty|pederastic]]. See [[Pederasty in ancient Greece]] for more information.

==The army of Alexander the Great before the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]==
{{main|Ancient Macedonian military}}
The army of Alexander was, for the most part, that of his father Philip. It was composed of light and heavy troops and some engineers, medical and staff units. About one third of the army was composed of his Greek allies from the Hellenic League. 

===Infantry===
[[Image:Macedonian battle formation.gif|right|thumb|330px|Macedonian battle formation, courtesy of The Department of History, United States Military Academy.]]
The main infantry corps was the [[Macedonian phalanx|phalanx]], composed of six regiments (''taxies'') numbering about 2000 phalangites each. Each soldier had a long [[pike]] called a ''[[sarissa]]'', which was up to 21 feet long, and a short [[sword]]. For protection, the soldier wore a [[Phrygian cap|Phrygian-style]] [[helmet]] and a [[shield]]. [[Arrian]] mentions large shields (the ''[[aspis]]''), but this is disputed, as it is difficult to wield both a large pike and a large shield at the same time. Many modern historians claim the [[phalanx]] used a smaller shield, called a ''[[pelta]]'', the shield used by [[peltast]]s. It is unclear whether the phalanx used body armor, but heavy body armor is mentioned in Arrian (1.28.7) and other ancient sources. Modern historians believe most of the phalangites did not wear heavy body armor at the time of Alexander.

Another important unit were the [[hypaspist]]s (shield bearers), arranged into three battalions (''[[lochoi]]'') of 1000 men each. One of the battalions was named the ''[[Agema]]'' and served as the King's bodyguards. Their armament is unknown and it is difficult to get a clear picture from ancient sources. Sometimes hypaspists are mentioned in the front line of the battle just between the phalanx and the heavy [[cavalry]]. Moreover, they seem to have acted as an extension of the phalanx fighting as heavy infantry while keeping a link between the heavily clad phalangites and the companion cavalry. They also accompanied Alexander on flanking marches and were capable of fighting on rough terrain like light troops so it seems they could perform dual functions.

In addition to the units mentioned above, the army included some 6000 Greek allied and mercenary [[hoplite]]s, also arranged in phalanxes. They carried a shorter [[spear]], a ''[[dora]]'', which was six or seven feet long and a large ''aspis''. 

Alexander also had light infantry units composed of [[peltast]]s, [[psiloi]] and others. Peltasts are considered to be light infantry, although they had a helmet and a small shield and were heavier than the ''psiloi''. The best peltasts were the [[Agrianians]] from [[Thrace]].

===Cavalry===
The heavy cavalry included the [[Companion cavalry]] raised from the Macedonian nobility, and the Thessalian cavalry. The Companion cavalry (''hetairoi'', friends) was divided into eight squadrons called ''ile'', 200 strong, except the Royal Squadron of 300. They were equipped with a 12 foot lance, the ''xyston'', and heavy body armor. The horses were partially clad in armor as well. The riders did not carry shields, as the xyston required both hands to wield. The organization of the Thessalian cavalry was similar to the Companion Cavalry, but they had a shorter spear and fought in a looser formation.

Of light cavalry, the ''prodromoi'' (forerunners) secured the wings of the army during battle and went on [[reconnaissance]] missions. Several hundred allied horses rounded out the cavalry.

==Death==
[[Image:Alexander the great 1.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Alexander the Great.]]

On the afternoon of [[June 10]] - [[June 11|11]], [[323 BC]], Alexander died of a mysterious illness in the palace of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadrezzar II of Babylon]]. He was just one month shy of attaining 33 years of age. Various theories have been proposed for the cause of his death which include [[poisoning]] by the sons of [[Antipater]] or others, sickness that followed a drinking party, or a relapse of the [[malaria]] he had contracted in [[336 BC]].

What is certain is that on May 29, Alexander participated in a banquet organized by his friend [[Medius of Larissa]]. After some heavy drinking, immediately or after a bath, he was forced to bed badly ill. The troops started rumors, more and more anxious, and on June 9, the generals decided to let the soldiers see their king alive one last time. They were admitted to his presence one at a time, while the king, too ill to speak, confined himself to move his hand. The day after, Alexander was dead.  

The poisoning theory derives from the story held in antiquity by Justin and Curtius. The original story stated that [[Cassander]], son of [[Antipater]], viceroy of Greece, brought the poison to Alexander in Babylon in a mule's hoof, and that Alexander's royal cupbearer, [[Iollas]], brother of Cassander, administered it. Many had powerful motivations for seeing Alexander gone, and were none the worse for it after his death. Deadly agents that could have killed Alexander in one or more doses include hellebore and [[strychnine]].  In [[Robin Lane Fox|R. Lane Fox]]'s opinion, the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days had passed between the start of his illness and his death and in the ancient world, such long-acting poisons were probably not available (though this discounts the possibility of multiple doses). 

However, the warrior culture of Macedon favored the sword over strychnine, and many ancient historians, like [[Plutarch]] and [[Arrian]], maintained that Alexander was not poisoned, but died of natural causes.  Instead, it is likely that Alexander died of malaria or typhoid fever, which were rampant in ancient Babylon.  Other illnesses could have also been the culprit, including [[acute pancreatitis]] or the [[West Nile virus|West Nile]] virus. Recently, theories have been advanced stating that Alexander may have died from the treatment not the disease.  [[Hellebore]], believed to have been widely used as a medicine at the time but deadly in large doses, may have been overused by the impatient king to speed his recovery, with deadly results.  Disease-related theories often cite the fact that Alexander's health had fallen to dangerously low levels after years of heavy drinking and suffering several appalling wounds (including one in [[India]] that nearly claimed his life), and that it was only a matter of time before one sickness or another finally killed him.  

No story is conclusive. Alexander's death has been reinterpreted many times over the centuries, and each generation offers a new take on it. What is certain is that Alexander died of a high fever on June 10 or 11 of 323 BC. On his death bed, his marshals asked him to whom he bequeathed his kingdom. Since Alexander had only one heir, it was a question of vital importance. He answered famously, &quot;the strongest.&quot;  Before dying, his final words were &quot;I foresee a great funeral contest over me.&quot; Alexander's 'funeral games', where his marshals fought it out over control of his empire, lasted for nearly forty years.  

Alexander's death has been surrounded by as much controversy as many of the events of his life. Before long, accusations of foul play were being thrown about by his generals at one another, making it incredibly hard for a modern historian to sort out the propaganda and the half-truths from the actual events. No contemporary source can be fully trusted because of the incredible level of self-serving recording, and as a result what truly happened to Alexander the Great may never be known.

Alexander's body was placed in a gold anthropid [[sarcophagus]], which was in turn placed in a second gold casket and covered with a purple robe. Alexander's coffin was placed, together with his armor, in a gold carriage which had a vaulted roof supported by an Ionic peristyle. The decoration of the carriage was very rich and is described in great detail by Diodoros. 

According to legend, Alexander was preserved in a clay vessel full of [[honey]] (which acts as a preservative) and interred in a glass [[coffin]]. According to Aelian (''Varia Historia'' 12.64), [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] stole the body and brought it to [[Alexandria]], where it was on display until Late Antiquity. It was here that [[Ptolemy IX of Egypt|Ptolemy IX]], one of the last successors of Ptolemy I, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one, and melted the original down in order to strike emergency gold issues of his coinage. The citizens of Alexandria were outraged at this and soon after Ptolemy IX was killed. Its current whereabouts are unknown.

The so-called &quot;Alexander Sarcophagus,&quot; discovered near [[Sidon]] and now in the [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]], is now generally thought to be that of [[Abdylonymus]], whom Hephaestion appointed as the king of Sidon by Alexander's order. The sarcophagus depicts Alexander and his companions hunting and in battle with the Persians.

==Legacy and division of the empire==
{{main|Diadochi}}
[[Image:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coin of Alexander bearing an [[Aramaic language]] inscription.]]
After Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his officers, mostly with the pretense of first preserving a united kingdom. Later, his officers were focused on the explicit formation of rival monarchies and territorial states. 

Ultimately, the conflict was settled after the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]] in [[301 BC]]. Alexander's empire was divided at first into four major portions: Cassander ruled in [[Macedon]], [[Lysimachus]] in [[Thrace]], [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Iran]], and [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] in the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] ruled for a while in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]] but was eventually defeated by the other generals at Ipsus ([[301 BC]]). Control over [[India]]n territory was short-lived when Seleucus was defeated by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the first [[Mauryan]] emperor.

By [[270 BC]], [[Hellenistic]] states consolidated, with:
:*The [[Antigonid dynasty|Antigonid Empire]] centered on Macedon.
:*The [[Seleucid Empire]] in Asia
:*The [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic kingdom]] in Egypt, Palestine and [[Cyrenaica]] 

By the [[1st century BC]] though, most of the Hellenistic territories in the West had been absorbed by the [[Roman Republic]]. In the East, they had been dramatically reduced by the expansion of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the secession of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] kingdom.

Alexander's conquests also had long term [[cultural]] effects, with the flourishing of [[Hellenistic civilization]] throughout the [[Middle-East]] and [[Central Asia]], and the development of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]].
===Influence on [[Ancient Rome]]===
[[Image:Mosaica.jpg|thumb|200px|A mural in [[Pompeii]], depicting the marriage of Alexander to Barsine (Stateira) in 324 BC. The couple are apparently dressed as Ares and Aphrodite.]]
Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements, although very little is known about Roman-Macedonian diplomatic relations of that time. [[Julius Caesar]] wept in Spain at the mere sight of Alexander's statue and [[Pompey the Great]] rummaged through the closets of conquered nations for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which the Roman general then wore as the costume of greatness. However in his zeal to honor Alexander, [[Octavian Augustus]] accidentally broke the nose off the Macedonian's mummified corpse while laying a wreath at the hero's shrine in Alexandria, Egypt. The unbalanced emperor [[Caligula]] later took the dead king's armor from that tomb and donned it
for luck. The Macriani, a Roman family that rose to the imperial throne in the [[3rd century]] A.D., always kept images of Alexander on their persons, either stamped into their bracelets and rings or stitched into their garments. Even their dinnerware bore Alexander's face, with the story of the king's life displayed around the rims of special bowls[[#Notes|&amp;sup1;]].

In the summer of [[1995]] during the archaeological work of the season centered on excavating the remains of domestic architecture of early-Roman date a statue of Alexander was recovered from the structure, which was richly decorated with mosaic and marble pavements and probably was constructed in the 1st century A.D. and occupied until the 3rd century[[#Notes|&amp;sup2;]].

==Alexander's character==
{{npov-section}}

[[Image:Ac alexanderstatue.jpg|thumb|250px|Equestrian statue of [[Alexander the Great]], on the waterfront at [[Thessaloniki]], capital of [[Greek Macedonia]].]]

Modern opinion on Alexander has run the gamut from the idea that he believed he was on a divinely-inspired mission to unite the [[human race]], to the view that he was a [[Narcissism|megalomaniac]] bent on [[Global domination|world domination]]. Such views tend to be [[Anachronism|anachronistic]], however, and the sources allow for a variety of interpretations. Much about Alexander's personality and aims remains enigmatic.

Alexander is remembered as a legendary hero in [[Europe]] and much of both [[Southwest Asia]] and [[Central Asia]], where he is known as '''Iskander''' or '''Iskandar Zulkarnain'''. To [[Zoroastrians]], on the other hand, he is remembered as the destroyer of their first great empire and as the leveller of [[Persepolis]]. Ancient sources are generally written with an agenda of either glorifying or denigrating the man, making it difficult to evaluate his actual character. Most refer to a growing instability and megalomania in the years following Gaugamela, but it has been suggested that this simply reflects the Greek [[stereotype]] of an orientalizing king. The murder of his friend [[Clitus the Black|Clitus]], which Alexander deeply and immediately regretted, is often cited as a sign of his paranoia, as is his execution of Philotas and his general Parmenion for failure to pass along details of a plot against him. However, this may have been more prudence than paranoia.

Modern Alexandrists continue to debate these same issues, among others, in modern times. One unresolved topic involves whether Alexander was actually attempting to better the world by his conquests, or whether his purpose was primarily to rule the world.

Partially in response to the ubiquity of positive portrayals of Alexander, an alternate character is sometimes presented which emphasizes some of Alexander's negative aspects. Some proponents of this view cite the destructions of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Tyre]], [[Persepolis]], and [[Gaza]] as examples of atrocities, and argue that Alexander preferred to fight rather than negotiate. It is further claimed, in response to the view that Alexander was generally tolerant of the cultures of those whom he conquered, that his attempts at cultural fusion were severely practical and that he never actually admired Persian art or culture. To this way of thinking, Alexander was, first and foremost, a general rather than a statesman.

Alexander's character also suffers from the interpretation of historians who themselves are subject to the bias and idealisms of their own time. Good examples are [[W. W. Tarn]], who wrote during the late [[19th century]] and early [[20th century]], and who saw Alexander in an extremely good light, and [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], who wrote after [[World War II]] and for whom Alexander did little that was not inherently selfish or ambition-driven. Tarn wrote in an age where world conquest and warrior-heroes were acceptable, even encouraged, whereas Green wrote with the backdrop of [[the Holocaust]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s. As a result, Alexander's character is skewed depending on which way the historian's own culture is, and further muddles the debate of who he truly was.

===Stories and legends===
According to one story, the philosopher [[Anaxarchus]] checked the vainglory of Alexander, when he aspired to the honors of divinity, by pointing to Alexander's wound, saying, &quot;See the blood of a mortal, not the [[ichor]] of a god.&quot; In another version, Alexander himself pointed out the difference in response to a [[sycophant]]ic soldier. A strong oral tradition, although not attested in any extant primary source, lists Alexander as having [[epilepsy]], known to the Greeks as the Sacred Disease and thought to be a mark of divine favor.

Alexander had a legendary horse named [[Bucephalus]] (meaning &quot;ox-headed&quot;), supposedly descended from the [[Mares of Diomedes]]. Alexander himself, while still a young boy, tamed this horse after experienced horse-trainers failed to do so.

There is an apocryphal tale, appearing in a redaction of the pseudo-historical [[Alexander Romance]], which details another end for the last true Pharaoh of Egypt. Soon after Alexander's divinity was confirmed by the Oracle of Zeus Ammon, a rumor was begun that [[Nectanebo II]] did not travel to [[Nubia]] but instead to the court of Philip II of Macedon in the guise of an Egyptian magician. He coupled with Phillip's wife [[Olympias]] and from his issue came Alexander. This myth would hold strong appeal for Egyptians who desired continuity in rule and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule.

Another legend tells of Alexander's campaign down into the Syrian world toward Egypt. On the way, he planned to lay siege to the city of [[Jerusalem]]. As the victorious armies of the Greeks approached the city, word was brought to the Jews in Jerusalem that the armies were on their way. The high priest at that time, who was a godly old man by the name of Jaddua (mentioned also in the [[Bible]] [[book of Nehemiah]]) took the sacred writings of [[Daniel the prophet]] and, accompanied by a host of other priests dressed in white garments, went forth and met Alexander some distance outside the city.

All this is from the report of [[Josephus]], the Jewish historian, who tells us that Alexander left his army and hurried to meet this body of priests. When he met them, he told the high priest that he had had a vision the night before in which God had shown him an old man, robed in a white garment, who would show him something of great significance to himself, according to the account, the high priest then opened the prophecies of Daniel and read them to Alexander.

In the prophecies Alexander was able to see the predictions that he would become that notable goat with the horn in his forehead, who would come from the West and smash the power of Persia and conquer the world. He was so overwhelmed by the accuracy of this prophecy and, of course, by the fact that it spoke about him, that he promised that he would save Jerusalem from siege, and sent the high priest back with honors.

==Ancient sources==
The ancient sources for Alexander's life are, from the perspective of ancient history, relatively numerous. Alexander himself left only a few inscriptions and some letter-fragments of dubious authenticity, but a large number of his contemporaries wrote full accounts. The key contemporary historians are considered [[Callisthenes]], his general [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], [[Nearchus]] and [[Onesicritus]]. Another influential account was penned by [[Cleitarchus]], who, while not a direct witness of Alexander's expedition, used the sources which had just been published. His work was to be the backbone of that of [[Timagenes]], who heavily influenced many surviving historians. Unfortunately, all these works were lost. Instead, the modern historian must rely on authors who used these and other early sources. 

The five main accounts are by Arrian, Curtius, Plutarch, Diodorus, and Justin.
* ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' (''The Campaigns of Alexander'' in Greek) by the Greek historian [[Arrian]] of [[Nicomedia]], writing in the [[2nd century AD]], and based largely on Ptolemy and, to a lesser extent, Aristobulus and Nearchus. It is considered generally the most trustworthy source.
* ''Historiae Alexandri Magni'', a biography of Alexander in ten books, of which the last eight survive, by the Roman historian [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], written in the [[1st century AD]], and based largely on Cleitarchus through the mediation of Timagenes, with some material probably from Ptolemy;
* ''Life of Alexander'' (see ''[[Parallel Lives]]'') and two orations ''On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great'' (see ''[[Moralia]]''), by the Greek historian and biographer [[Plutarch]] of [[Chaeronea]] in the second century, based largely on Aristobulus and especially Cleitarchus.
* ''Bibliotheca historia'' (''Library of world history''), written in Greek by the [[Sicilian]] historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], from which Book 17 relates the conquests of Alexander, based almost entirely on Timagenes's work. The books immediately before and after, on Philip and Alexander's &quot;Successors,&quot; throw light on Alexander's reign.
* The ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'' by [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], which contains factual errors and is highly compressed. It is difficult in this case to understand the source, since we only have an epitome, but it is thought that also [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]] may have limited himself to use Timagenes for his Latin history. To these five main sources some like to add the ''[[Metz Epitome]]'', an anonymous late Latin work that narrates Alexander's campaigns from [[Hyrcania]] to India. Much is also recounted incidentally in other authors, including [[Strabo]], [[Athenaeus]], [[Polyaenus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and others.

The &quot;problem of the sources&quot; is the main concern (and chief delight) of Alexander-historians. In effect, each presents a different &quot;Alexander,&quot; with details to suit. Arrian is mostly interested in the military aspects, while Curtius veers to a more private and darker Alexander. Plutarch can't resist a good story, light or dark. All, with the possible exception of Arrian, include a considerable level of fantasy, prompting Strabo to remark, &quot;All who wrote about Alexander preferred the marvellous to the true.&quot; Nevertheless, the sources tell us much, and leave much to our interpretation and imagination.

==Alexander's legend==
Alexander was a legend in his own time. His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in [[Cilicia]] as drawing back from him in [[proskynesis]]. Writing after Alexander's death, another participant, [[Onesicritus]], went so far as to invent a [[tryst]] between Alexander and [[Thalestris]], queen of the mythical [[Amazons]]. When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King [[Lysimachus]], Lysimachus reportedly quipped &quot;I wonder where I was at the time.&quot; 

In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in [[Alexandria]], a quantity of the more legendary material coalesced into a text known as the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', later falsely ascribed to the historian Callisthenes and therefore known as ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]], exhibiting a plasticity unseen in &quot;higher&quot; literary forms. Latin and [[Syriac]] translations were made in Late Antiquity. From these, versions were developed in all the major languages of [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], including [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[French language|French]]. The &quot;Romance&quot; is regarded by most Western scholars as the source of the [[account of Alexander given in the Qur'an]] ([[Sura]] ''The Cave''). It is the source of many incidents in [[Ferdowsi]]'s &quot;[[Shahnama]]&quot;. A [[Mongol]]ian version is also extant. 

Some believe that, excepting certain religious texts, it is the most widely-read work of pre-modern times.

===Alexander's legend in non-Western sources===
{{main|Alexander in the Qur'an (Theory)}}
Alexander was often identified in Persian and Arabic-language sources as [[Dhul-Qarnayn]], Arabic for the &quot;Two-Horned One&quot;, possibly a reference to the appearance of a horn-headed figure that appears on coins minted during his rule and later imitated in ancient Middle Eastern coinage. If this theory is followed, [[Islamic]] accounts of the Alexander legend, particularly in the [[Qur'an]] and in Persian legends, combined the [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]] legendary, pseudo-religious material about Alexander. The same legends from the Pseudo-Callisthenes were combined in Persia with [[Sasanid]] [[Pahlavi languge|Persian]] ideas about Alexander in the [[Iskandarnamah]].

==Main towns founded by Alexander==
Around seventy towns or outposts are claimed to have been founded by Alexander. Some of the main ones are: 

* [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]
* [[Alexandria Asiana]], [[Iran]]
* [[Alexandria in Ariana]], [[Afghanistan]]
* [[Alexandria of the Caucasus]], [[Afghanistan]]
* [[Alexandria on the Oxus]], [[Afghanistan]]
* [[Alexandria of the Arachosians]], [[Afghanistan]]
* [[Alexandria on the Indus]] (Alexandria Bucephalous), [[Pakistan]]
* [[Alexandria Eschate|Alexandria Eschate, &quot;The furthest&quot;]], [[Tajikistan]]
* [[Iskenderun]] (Alexandretta), [[Turkey]]
* [[Kandahar]] (Alexandropolis), [[Afghanistan]]

*The British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] had a song entitled &quot;[[Alexander the Great (song)|Alexander the Great]]&quot; on their album ''[[Somewhere in Time (album)|Somewhere in Time]]'' ([[1986]]). The song describes Alexander's life, but contains one inaccuracy: in the song it is stated that Alexander's army would not follow him into India.
* Brazilian musician [[Caetano Veloso]]'s [[1998]] album ''Livro'' includes an epic song about Alexander called &quot;Alexandre.&quot;
*From [[1969]] to [[1981]], [[Mary Renault]] wrote a historical fiction [[trilogy]], speculating on the life of Alexander: ''Fire from Heaven'' (about his early life), ''The Persian Boy'' (about his conquest of Persia, his expedition to India, and his death, seen from the viewpoint of a Persian [[eunuch]]), and ''Funeral Games'' (about the events following his death). Alexander also appears briefly in Renault's novel ''The Mask of Apollo''. In addition to the fiction, Renault also wrote a non-fiction biography, ''The Nature of Alexander''.
*A 1965 [[Hindi]] movie ''Sikandar-e-Azam'' directed by [[Kedar Kapoor]] starring [[Dara Singh]] as Alexandar depicts Alexandar's Indian conquest with Porus.
*A further trilogy of novels about Alexander was written in [[Italian language|Italian]] by [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]] and subsequently published in an English translation, entitled ''The Son of the Dream'', ''The Sands of Ammon'' and ''The Ends Of The Earth''.

*[[Steven Pressfield]]'s [[2004]] book ''The Virtues of War'' is told from the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] [[point of view (literature)|perspective]] of Alexander.
*An [[epic poetry|epic]] [[science fiction]] [[animation|animated]] retelling of the story called ''[[Reign (anime)|Reign: The Conqueror]]'', based on the novel ''Alexander Senki'' by [[Hiroshi Aramata]], with character designs by [[Peter Chung]] of ''[[Aeon Flux]]'' fame, debuted in [[Japan]] in [[1997]] and on the [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Adult Swim]]'' block variety show in [[2003]].
* Alexander is a character in the [[computer game]] [[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]].
* The ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' season 1 episode &quot;Rogue&quot;, [[Lex Luthor]] shows [[Superman|Clark Kent]] the shield that Alexander the Great wore in battle. The shield is gold, with red and blue diamonds (the colors that represent [[Superman]]), and  a snake shaped like the letter S.
* The [[1975]] film ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'' starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Michael Caine]] is based on the [[Rudyard Kipling]] [[The Man Who Would Be King|story]] of two British adventurers who cross the Hindu Kush to the land of [[Kafiristan]], once conquered by Alexander. Daniel (Connery) is believed by the natives to be the return of Alexander and is crowned King.

==Notes==
{{ent|1|MvsG1}} Whether the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] of Alexander's time and before were [[Hellenes]] (Greeks) is disputed by scholars. The question largely depends on the classification of the [[Ancient Macedonian language]]. By separating Macedonians and Greeks in this sentence and others, no position in this debate is implied.

'''Alfred Korzybski''' was born on [[July 3]], [[1879]] in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], and died on [[March 1]], [[1950]] in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]], [[United States|USA]]. He is probably best-remembered for developing the theory of [[general semantics]].

==Early life and career==
He came from an [[aristocratic]] family whose members had worked as [[Mathematics|mathematicians]], [[Science|scientists]], and [[Engineering|engineers]] for generations, and he chose to train as an engineer.

Korzybski was educated at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]] Korzybski served as an [[Military intelligence|intelligence officer]] in the [[Russia|Russian]] Army. After being wounded in his leg and suffering other injuries, he came to North America in [[1916]] (first to [[Canada]], then the [[United States]]) to coordinate the shipment of artillery to the war front. He also lectured to [[Polish-American]] audiences about the conflict, promoting the sale of war bonds. Following the war, he decided to remain in the United States, becoming a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] in [[1940]]. His first book, &lt;cite&gt;Manhood of Humanity&lt;/cite&gt; was published in [[1921]]. In the book, he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind: mankind as a [[time-binding]] class of life.

==General semantics ==
Korzybski's work culminated in the founding of a discipline that he called [[general semantics]] (GS). As Korzybski explicitly said, GS should not be confused with [[semantics]], a different subject. The basic principles of general semantics, which include time-binding, are outlined in &lt;cite&gt;Science and Sanity&lt;/cite&gt;, published in [[1933]]. In [[1938]] Korzybski founded the [[Institute of General Semantics]] and directed it until his death.

In simplified form, the &quot;essence&quot; of Korzybski's work was the claim that human beings are limited in what they know by (1) the structure of their nervous systems, and (2) the [[structure]] of their languages. Human beings cannot experience the world directly, but only through their &quot;abstractions&quot; (nonverbal impressions or &quot;gleanings&quot; derived from the nervous system, and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language). Sometimes our perceptions and our languages actually mislead us as to the &quot;facts&quot; with which we must deal. Our understanding of what is going on sometimes lacks ''similarity of structure'' with what is actually going on. He stressed training in awareness of abstracting, using techniques that he had derived from his study of mathematics and science. He called this awareness, this goal of his system, &quot;consciousness of abstracting.&quot; His system included modifying the way we approach the world, e.g., with an attitude of &quot;I don't know; let's see,&quot; to better discover or reflect its realities as shown by modern science. One of these techniques involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet, an experience that he called, &quot;silence on the objective levels.&quot;

== Korzybski and ''to be'' ==
It is often said that Korzybski opposed the use of the verb &quot;to be,&quot; an unfortunate exaggeration. He thought that ''certain uses'' of the verb &quot;to be,&quot; called the &quot;is of identity&quot; and the &quot;is of predication,&quot; were faulty in structure, e.g., a statement such as &quot;Joe is a fool&quot; (said of a person named 'Joe' who has done something that we regard as dumb). Korzybski's remedy was to ''deny'' identity; in this example, to be continually aware that 'Joe' is ''not'' what we ''call'' him. We find Joe not in the verbal domain, the world of words, but the nonverbal domain. This was expressed in Korzybski's most famous premise, &quot;[[The map is not the territory|the map is not the territory]].&quot; Note that &quot;the map is not the territory,&quot; uses the phrase &quot;is not&quot;, a form of the verb &quot;to be.&quot; This example shows that he did not intend to abandon the verb as such.

== Anecdote about Korzybski ==
One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he suddenly interrupted the lesson in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row, if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. &quot;Nice biscuit, don't you think&quot;, said Korzybski, while he took a second one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words &quot;Dog Cookies&quot;. The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to throw up, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. &quot;You see, ladies and gentlemen&quot;, Korzybski remarked, &quot;I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.&quot; Apparently his prank aimed to illustrate how human suffering originates from the confusion or conflation of linguistic representations of reality and reality itself. (Source: R. Diekstra, ''Haarlemmer Dagblad'', 1993, cited by L. Derks &amp; J. Hollander, ''Essenties van NLP'' (Utrecht: Servire, 1996), p. 58).

== Impact ==
Korzybski's work influenced [[Neuro-linguistic programming]] (especially the [[metamodel]]), [[Gestalt Therapy]], [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] and individuals such as [[Albert Ellis]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Alvin Toffler]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[L. Ron Hubbard]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], Tommy Hall (lyricist for the [[13th Floor Elevators]]), and scientists such as William Alanson White (psychiatry), and W. Horsley Gantt (a student and colleague of Pavlov).

'''''Asteroids''''' is a popular [[vector graphics|vector-based]] video [[arcade game]] released in 1979 by [[Atari Games|Atari]]. The object of the game is for the player to shoot and destroy [[asteroid]]s without being hit by the fragments. It was one of the most popular and influential games of the [[Golden Age of Arcade Games]].

==Description==

''Asteroids'' was inspired, in a roundabout way, by the seminal ''[[Spacewar]]'', the first computer-based video game. In the early 1980s a stand-up arcade game version was produced as ''Space Wars'', which included a number of optional versions and added a floating asteroid as a visual device. ''Asteroids'' is essentially a one-player version of Spacewar, featuring the &quot;wedge&quot; ship from the original and promoting the asteroids to be the main opponent.

The game was conceived by [[Lyle Rains]] and programmed by [[Ed Logg]]. ''Asteroids'' was a hit in the [[United States]] and became one of Atari's best selling games of all time. Atari had been in the process of releasing a vector beam version of ''[[Lunar Lander]]'', but demand for ''Asteroids'' was so high they simply pulled them apart and converted them over. Today the ''Lunar Lander'' version is difficult to find. ''Asteroids'' was so popular that [[video arcade]] owners usually had to install larger boxes to hold all the coins this machine raked in.

One feature of the game was the ability for players to record their initials with their high scores, an innovation which is standard in arcade games to this day.

''Asteroids'' was the first of several games to use Atari's &quot;Quadra-Scan&quot; vector-refresh system (although a [[Raster graphics|raster-based]] full-color version was developed for the [[Atari 2600]] home video game system). Later full-color Quadra-Scan games would include ''[[Tempest (game)|Tempest]]''.

==Features==

The player's controls consisted of thrust and fire buttons, and rotate left/rotate right buttons (actually rotate counterclockwise and rotate clockwise respectively).  The momentum of the player's ship was not conserved, and it would start to slow down if thrust was not applied.  There was also a [[hyperspace]] button, which randomly teleported the player's ship somewhere on the screen, with the risk of exploding upon rematerialization (or rematerializing inside an asteroid).

The player's ship spawned in the middle of the screen, with 4 large asteroids drifting around.  Each large asteroid (20 points) would break into 2 medium-sized ones (50 points) when shot, which in turn would break into 2 small (100 points) asteroids.  The medium and small asteroids, once &quot;spawned&quot;, could travel at widely varying speeds. Periodically one of two types of flying saucers (&quot;UFOs&quot;) would fly onto the screen: the big one (worth 200 points) would shoot in random directions, while the small one (1000 points) would attempt to aim at the player; they tended to appear more often when few asteroids remained on the screen and/or the player hadn't shot an asteroid recently.  The screen wrapped around, allowing the player's ship, as well as asteroids and shots but not saucers, to fly off the one edge of the screen and reappear on the opposite side.  Once a level had been cleared of all asteroids and UFOs, a new set of large asteroids would appear, increasing by 2 each round up to a maximum of 12.

The maximum score possible was 99,990 points, after which it turned back over to zero.  A player who desired to get onto the top score list then had to be careful to shoot just enough asteroids/UFOs to reach this score without going over (including committing suicide with the last ship left to reach the final total!).

On some early versions of the game it was possible to hide the ship in the score area indefinitely without being hit by asteroids.

==Lurking==
[[Image:Asteroids UFO.svg|thumb|right|150px|The small UFO is the key to high scores for many advanced players.]]
Soon after the release of ''Asteroids'', some players discovered that small UFOs would be continually sent out when the asteroid count decreased to a certain level. Since these UFOs were worth 1,000 points each - a significant sum on this game - a strategy known as &quot;lurking&quot; soon developed around this. Players would shoot asteroids until there was only one small or mid-sized rock remaining, and then maneuver the ship to a spot approximately one inch from any corner of the screen. Small UFOs would then be ambushed as soon as they emerged (and before they were able to return fire), using wraparound fire if necessary.  Because the small UFOs were unable to &quot;lead&quot; the player's ship with their fire (i.e. aiming ahead of the ship's flight path), a clever player could manuever, if necessary, in such a way as to virtually ensure they would never be hit by the small UFO (in fact the large UFO in a sense was seen as more of a threat precisely because of its unpredictable random shots).  Since each 10,000 points awarded an extra life, players could continue almost indefinitely once the practice had been mastered. [http://www.gamearchive.com/General/Articles/ClassicNews/1981/Esquire2-81-pg62.htm] The designers abolished this practice in ''Asteroids Deluxe'' by causing the UFOs to either shoot at the remaining asteroids, thus ending the round, or shoot at the player as soon as they appeared on the screen-they also gained the ability to lead the player's ship as well, making them much more dangerous.

However it was also possible to succeed by shooting the asteroids instead; a shrewd &quot;asteroid hunting&quot; player would typically attempt to kill all the asteroids &quot;inside&quot; a large one before shooting another asteroid, thus minimizing the amount of &quot;clutter&quot; on the screen.

==Technical Description==
The ''Asteroids'' arcade machine is a so-called [[vector game]]. This means that the game graphics are composed entirely of lines which are drawn on a [[vector monitor]]. The hardware consists primarily of a standard [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] [[central processing unit|CPU]], which executes the game program, and the [[Atari Digital Vector Generator|Digital Vector Generator]] (DVG), vector processing [[circuitry]] developed by [[Atari]] themselves. As the 6502 by itself was too slow to control both the game play and the vector hardware at the same time, the latter task was delegated to the DVG.

For each picture frame, the 6502 writes graphics commands for the DVG into a defined area of [[RAM]] (the vector RAM), and then asks the DVG to draw the corresponding vector image on the screen. The DVG reads the commands and generates appropriate signals for the vector monitor. There are DVG commands for positioning the cathode ray, for drawing a line to a specified destination, calling a subroutine with further commands, and so on.

''Asteroids'' also features various sound effects, each of which is implemented by its own [[circuitry]]. The CPU activates these audio [[electrical network|circuits]] (and other hardware components) by writing to special memory addresses (memory mapped ports). The inputs from the player's controls (buttons) are also mapped into the CPU [[address space]]

The main ''Asteroids'' game program uses only 4 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] code. Another 4 KB of vector ROM contain the descriptions of the main graphical elements (rocks, saucer, player's ship, explosion pictures, letters, and digits) in the form of DVG commands.

==Legacy==
The gameplay in ''Asteroids'' was imitated by many games that followed. For example, one of the objects of ''[[Sinistar]]'' is to shoot asteroids in order to get them to release resources which the player needs to collect.

Due to its success, ''Asteroids'' was followed by three sequels:
* ''[[Asteroids Deluxe]]'' (1980)
* ''[[Space Duel]]'' (1982)
* ''[[Blasteroids]]'' (1987)

However, the original game was by far the most popular of the series.

The [[Killer List of Videogames]] (KLOV) credits this game as one of the &quot;Top 100 Videogames.&quot;  Readers of the KLOV credit it as the seventh most popular game.

==Ports==
Being one of the most popular video games ever, ''Asteroids'' has been ported to multiple systems, including many of [[Atari]]'s systems ([[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200|5200]], [[Atari 7800|7800]], [[Atari Lynx]]) and many others. The 2600 port was the first game to utilize a bank-switched cartridge, doubling available ROM space. Also, a new version of ''Asteroids'' was developed for [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and the [[Game Boy Color]] in the late 1990s. A port was also included on Atari's [[Atari Cosmos|Cosmos]] system, but the system never saw release. Many of the recent [[TV Games]] series of old Atari games have included either the 2600 or arcade versions of ''Asteroids''. Atari has also used the game for its other late '90s anthology series. Essentially, if one looks for this game, one will be able to find it somewhere.

In 2005, ''Asteroids'' (Including both [[Atari 2600]] and the arcade original, along with [[Asteroids Deluxe]]) were included as part of ''[[Atari Anthology]]'' for both [[XBox]] and [[Playstation 2]], using Digital Eclipse's emulation technology..

There have been countless unofficial versions of ''Asteroids'' produced. These include near-copies such as [[Acornsoft|Acornsoft's]] ''[[Meteors (game)|Meteors]]'', as well as those with expanded gameplay and background, such as ''[[Stardust (game)|Stardust]]'' and ''[[Starscape]]''.

==Record breaking gameplay==
In March 2004, [[Portland, Oregon]] resident '''Bill Carlton''' attempted to break the world record for playing an arcade version of ''Asteroids'', playing over 27 hours before his machine malfunctioned, ending his record run. He scored 12.7 million points, putting him in 5th place in the all-time ''Asteroids'' rankings. In November 1982 '''Scott Safran''' set the still unbroken record of 41 million points.

==Song==
In 1982, [[Buckner and Garcia]] recorded a song titled &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, using sound effects from the game, and released it on the album ''[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Pac-Man Fever]]''.

'''Asparagales''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[monocot]]s which includes a number of  families of non-woody plants. In older classification systems, the families now included in the Asparagales were included in order [[Liliales]], and some genera of which were even included in family [[Liliaceae]]. Some classification systems separate some of the families listed below into additional orders, including orders [[Orchidales]] and [[Iridales]], while other systems, especially the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]]'s classification system, include the Orchidales and Iridales within the Asparagales. The order is named after the genus ''[[Asparagus (genus)|Asparagus]]''.

The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group's classification system is widely used by botanists, and was updated as the APG II in 2002 to include recent findings, especially in [[DNA]] analysis. Their 1998 scheme identified 29 families in order Asparagales. The APG II consolidates some families, and recognizes an alternative system of fewer, larger families, in which certain smaller families can be grouped within other larger families based on close genetic affinities and still follow the 'APG system'. Under the new classification system one could, for example, correctly include daylilies (''[[Hemerocallis]]'') in family [[Hemerocallidaceae]], or in family [[Xanthorrhoeaceae]]. The APG II classification of the Asparagales is as follows: 
*[[Alliaceae]]
**[[Agapanthaceae]]
**[[Amaryllidaceae]]
*[[Asparagaceae]]
**[[Agavaceae]]
**[[Aphyllanthaceae]]
**[[Hesperocallidaceae]]
**[[Hyacinthaceae]]
**[[Laxmanniaceae]]
**[[Ruscaceae]]
**[[Themidaceae]]

*[[Boryaceae]]
*[[Doryanthaceae]]
*[[Hypoxidaceae]]
*[[Iridaceae]]
*[[Ixioliriaceae]]
*[[Lanariaceae]]
*[[Orchidaceae]]
*[[Tecophilaeaceae]]
*[[Xanthorrhoeaceae]]
**[[Asphodelaceae]]
**[[Hemerocallidaceae]]

Classification systems that separate the Asparagales, Orchidales and Iridales are generally organized as follows:
* Asparagales, narrow sense
** Family [[Asparagaceae]] ([[asparagus]] family)
** Family [[Alliaceae]] (onion family)
*** [[Chives]]
*** [[Garlic]]
*** [[Onion]]
** Family [[Agavaceae]] (agave family)

*** [[Hyacinthoides|Bluebell]]
*** [[Hyacinth (flower)|Hyacinth]]
** ''Cetera''
* [[Orchidales]]
** Family [[Geosiridaceae]]
** Family [[Burmanniaceae]]
** Family [[Corsiaceae]]
** Family [[Orchidaceae]] (orchid family)

The order '''Alismatales''' contains the alismatids, a group of [[monocotyledon]]s (class [[Liliopsida]]). The order contains about 165 genera in 14 families, with cosmopolitic distribution. Most families are comprised of [[herb]]aceous non-[[succulent]] plants. These plants are commonly found in aquatic environmments. The [[flower]]s are usually arranged in [[inflorescence]]s, and the mature seeds lack [[endosperm]].

Traditionally, the order Alismatales was restricted to contain just three families (Alismataceae, Butomaceae and Limnocharitaceae). The other families were not considered as alismatids, and were assigned to various distinct orders, but this approach produced [[polyphyletic]] groups, and so the whole group of families is now placed into a single order. 

The [[Petrosaviaceae]] have been placed in this order, but their actual affinity is not so clear. The alismatids have been considered the sister group of the [[Arales]] and the latter are now included here. As a result of this merger, the Araceae became the most important family in the order, accounting alone for over 2000 species in about 100 genera. The rest of families contain together just about 500 species.

The '''Apiales''' are an order of [[flowering plant]]s. The families given at right are typical of newer classifications, though there is some slight variation, and in particular the Torriceliaceae may be divided. These families are placed within the asterid group of [[dicotyledon]]s.

Under the older [[Cronquist system]], only the Apiaceae and Araliaceae were included here, and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids. The Pittosporaceae were placed within the [[Rosales]], and the other forms within the family [[Cornaceae]].

The '''Asterales''' are an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[dicotyledon]]ous [[flowering plant]]s which include the composite family [[Asteraceae]] ([[sunflower]]s and [[Bellis|daisies]]) and its related families.

The order is cosmopolitic, and includes mostly herbaceous species, although  a small number of trees (''Lobelia'') and shrubs is also present.

The Asterales can be characterized on the morphological and molecular level. Synapomorphies include the [[oligosaccharide]] [[inulin]] as the nutrients storage, and the stamens are usually aggregated densely around the style or even are fused into a tube around it. The last property is probably associated with the plunger (or secondary) [[pollination]], which is common among the families of the order.

== Families ==
The '''Asterales''' include about eleven families, the largest of which is [[Asteraceae]] with about 25,000 species, and [[Campanulaceae]] with about 2,000 species. The remaining families count together for less than 500 species. The two large families are cosmopolitic with center of mass in the northern hemisphere, and the smaller ones are usually confined to Australia and the adjacent areas, or sometimes the South America.

Under the [[Cronquist system]], [[Asteraceae]] was the only family in the group, but newer systems (e. g. [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|APG]] II) have expanded it.

==Evolution and biogeography==
The Asterales order probably originated in [[Cretaceous]] on the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], in the area which is now Australia and Asia. Although most extant species are herbaceous, the examination of the basal families in the order suggests that the common ancestor of the order was an arborescent plant.

Fossil evidence of the Asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epoques, so the precise estimation of the order's age is quite difficult. An [[Oligocene]] pollen is known for Asteraceae and Goodeniaceae, and seeds from Oligocene and [[Miocene]] are known for Menyanthaceae and Campanulaceae respectively.

(Bremer and Gustafsson, 1997)

==Economical importance==
The Asteraceae include some species grown for food, e. g. [[sunflower]] (''Helianthus annuus'') or [[chicory]] (''Cichorium''). Many spices and medicinal herbs are also present.

Of horticultural importance are the Asteraceae (e. g. [[chrysanthemum]]) and Campanulaceae.

An '''asteroid''' is a small, solid object in our [[Solar System]], orbiting the [[Sun]]. An asteroid is an example of a [[minor planet]] (or '''planetoid'''), which are much smaller than [[planet]]s. Most asteroids are believed to be remnants of the [[protoplanetary disc]] which were not incorporated into planets during the system's formation due to excessive gravitational perturbations by [[Jupiter]]. Some asteroids have [[Asteroid moon|moon]]s. The vast majority of the asteroids are within the main [[asteroid belt]], with [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits between those of [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. [[image:433eros.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This picture of [[433 Eros]] shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as 35 m across can be seen.]]



==Asteroids in the solar system==
[[Image:4 Vesta 1 Ceres Moon at 20 km per px.png|thumb|right|Left to right: [[4 Vesta]], [[1 Ceres]], Earth's [[Moon]].]]
Hundreds of thousands of asteroids have been discovered within the solar system, and the present rate of discovery is about 5000 per month. As of [[February 23]], [[2006]], from a total of 325,627 &lt;!--- astorb.dat record count ---&gt; registered minor planets, 120,437 have orbits known well enough to be given [[asteroid naming conventions|permanent official numbers]]. Of these, 12890&lt;!--- using http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/MPNames.html ---&gt; have official names (trivia: at least 610 of these names require [[diacritic]]s). The lowest-numbered but unnamed minor planet is [[(3360) 1981 VA]]; the highest-numbered named minor planet is [[117506 Wildberg]] [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/NumberedMPs115001.html].

Current estimates put the total number of asteroids in the solar system at several million. The largest asteroid in the inner solar system is [[1 Ceres]], with a diameter of 900-1000 km. Two other large inner solar system belt asteroids are [[2 Pallas]] and [[4 Vesta]]; both have diameters of ~500 km. Vesta is the only main belt asteroid that is sometimes visible to the naked eye (in some very rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may be visible without technical aid; see [[99942 Apophis]]).

The mass of all the asteroids of the Main Belt is estimated to be about 2.3x10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, or about 3% of the mass of our moon. Of this, [[1 Ceres]] comprises 940 to 950x10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, some 40% of the total. Adding in the next three most massive asteroids, [[4 Vesta]] (12%), [[2 Pallas]] (9%), and [[10 Hygiea]] (4%), bring this figure up 66%; while the three after that, [[511 Davida]] (1.6%), [[704 Interamnia]] (1.4%), and [[3 Juno]] (1.2%), only add another 4% to the total mass. The number of asteroids then increases [[Exponential distribution|exponentially]] as their individual masses decrease. 

See also a [[List of noteworthy asteroids]] in our Solar System, or a sequentially-ordered [[List of asteroids]].

==Asteroid classification==
Asteroids are commonly classified into groups based on the characteristics of their orbits and on the details of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]] of sunlight they reflect.

===Orbit groups and families===
:''main articles: [[asteroid family]] and [[minor planet]]''

Many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. It is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are much &quot;tighter&quot; and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past.

For a full listing of known asteroid groups and families, see [[minor planet]] and [[asteroid family]].

===Spectral classification===
[[Image:253 Mathilde small.jpg|thumb|right|[[253 Mathilde]], a [[C-type asteroid]].]]
In 1975, an asteroid [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] system based on [[colour]], [[albedo]], and [[spectral line|spectral shape]] was developed by [[Clark R. Chapman]], [[David Morrison]], and [[Ben Zellner]]. These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. Originally, they classified only three types of asteroids:

*[[C-type asteroid]]s - carbonaceous, 75% of known asteroids
*[[S-type asteroid]]s - silicaceous, 17% of known asteroids
*[[M-type asteroid]]s - metallic, most of the remaining asteroids

This list has since been expanded to include a number of other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied. See [[Asteroid spectral types]] for more detail or [[:Category:Asteroid spectral classes]] for a list.

Note that the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.

====Problems with spectral classification====

Originally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition:

* C - [[carbonate|Carbonaceous]]
* S - [[silicate|Silicaceous]]
* M - [[Metallic]]

However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and there are a variety of classifications in use. This has led to significant confusion. While asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.

At present, the spectral classification based on several coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys in the 1990s is still the standard. Scientists have been unable to agree on a better taxonomic system, largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids (e.g. finer resolution spectra, or non-spectral data such as densities would be very useful).

==Asteroid discovery==
===Historical discovery methods===
Asteroid discovery methods have drastically improved over the past two centuries. 

In the last years of the [[18th century]], Baron [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] organized a group of 24 astronomers to search the sky for the &quot;missing planet&quot; predicted at about 2.8 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the [[Sun]] by the [[Titius-Bode law]], partly as a consequence of the discovery, by Sir [[William Herschel]] in [[1781]], of the planet [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]] at the distance &quot;predicted&quot; by the law. This task required that hand-drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the [[zodiac]]al band down to an agreed-upon limit of faintness. On subsequent nights, the sky would be charted again and any moving object would, hopefully, be spotted. The expected motion of the missing planet was about 30 seconds of arc per hour, readily discernable by observers.

Ironically, the first asteroid, [[1 Ceres]], was not discovered by a member of the group, but rather by accident in [[1801]] by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] director, at the time, of the observatory of [[Palermo]], in [[Sicily]]. He discovered a new star-like object in [[Taurus]] and followed the displacement of this object during several nights. His colleague, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], used these observations to determine the exact distance from this unknown object to the Earth. Gauss' calculations placed the object between the planets [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. Piazzi named it after [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], the Roman goddess of agriculture.

Three other asteroids ([[2 Pallas]], [[3 Juno]], [[4 Vesta]]) were discovered over the next few years, with Vesta found in [[1807]]. After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.

However, [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in [[1830]]. Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime year 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were [[John Russell Hind|J. R. Hind]], [[Annibale de Gasparis]], [[Karl Theodor Robert Luther|Robert Luther]], [[Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt|H. M. S. Goldschmidt]], [[Jean Chacornac]], [[James Ferguson (astronomer)|James Ferguson]], [[Norman Robert Pogson]], [[Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht Tempel|E. W. Tempel]], [[James Craig Watson|J. C. Watson]], [[Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters|C. H. F. Peters]], [[Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly|A. Borrelly]], [[Johann Palisa|J. Palisa]], [[Paul Henry and Prosper Henry]] and [[Auguste Charlois]].

In [[1891]], however, [[Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf|Max Wolf]] pioneered the use of [[astrophotography]] to detect asteroids, which appeared as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates. This drastically increased the rate of detection compared with previous visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with [[323 Brucia]], whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point. Still, a century later, only a few thousand asteroids were identified, numbered and named. It was known that there were many more, but most astronomers did not bother with them, calling them &quot;vermin of the skies&quot;.

===Modern discovery methods===
Until [[1998]], asteroids were discovered by a four-step process. First, a region of the sky was [[photograph]]ed by a wide-field [[telescope]]. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two [[film]]s of the same region were viewed under a [[stereoscope]]. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would appear to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations [http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker/].

These first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an [[apparition]], which gets a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a code of two letters representing the week of discovery, and of a number so more than the one discovered one took place in this week (example: 1998 FJ74). 

The final step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to [[Brian Marsden]] of the [[Minor Planet Center]]. Dr. Marsden has computer programs that compute whether an apparition ties together previous apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object gets a number. The observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and he gets the honour of naming the asteroid (subject to the approval of the [[International Astronomical Union]]) once it is numbered.

===Latest technology: detecting hazardous asteroids===
There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross [[Earth|Earth's]] orbit, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth (see [[Earth-crosser asteroid]]s). The three most important groups of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s are the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]], [[Amor_asteroid|Amors]], and the [[Aten_asteroid|Atens]]. Various [[asteroid deflection strategies]] have been proposed.

The [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] asteroid [[433 Eros]] had been discovered as long ago as [[1898]], and the [[1930]]s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: [[1221 Amor]], [[1862 Apollo]], [[2101 Adonis]], and finally [[69230 Hermes]], which approached within 0.005 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] of the [[Earth]] in [[1937]]. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.

Two events in later decades increased the level of alarm: the increasing acceptance of [[Walter Alvarez]]' theory of [[K-T extinction|dinosaur extinction]] being due to an [[impact event]], and the [[1994]] observation of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashing into [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its military satellites, built to detect nuclear explosions, had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to 10 metres across.

All of these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient automated systems that consist of Charge-Coupled Device ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. Since [[1998]], a large majority of the asteroids have been discovered by such automated systems. A list of teams using such automated systems includes [http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs]:

* The [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR) team
* The [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (NEAT) team
* [[Spacewatch]]
* The [[LONEOS|Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search]] (LONEOS) team
* The [[Catalina Sky Survey]] (CSS)
* The [[Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Objects Survey]] (CINEOS) team
* The [[Japanese Spaceguard Association]]
* The [[Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey]] (ADAS)

The LINEAR system alone has discovered 62,283 asteroids as of [[December 14]], [[2005]] [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/MPDiscSites.html]. Between all of the automated systems, 3868 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/Unusual.html] including over 600 more than 1 km in diameter.

==Naming asteroids==
===The naming format===
Newly discovered asteroids are given a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code, such as 2001 FH. When its orbit is confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. [[1 Ceres]]). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. ''(433) Eros''), however, dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, especially when a name is repeated in running text, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention.

The [[Minor Planet Circular]] (MPC) of [[October 19]], [[2005]] was a historical one, as it saw the highest numbered asteroid jump from 99947 to 118161, causing a small &quot;[[Y2k]]&quot; like crisis for various automated data services &amp;mdash;up until then, only five digits were allowed in most data formats for the asteroid number. This has been addressed in some data fields by having the leftmost digit, the ten-thousands place, use the alphabet as a digit extension. A=10, B=11,…, Z=35, a=36,…, z=61. The highest number 120437 thus is cross-referenced as C0437 on some lists. Also, the fictional asteroid of ''[[The Little Prince]]'', '''B612''', now could be connected with the real (110612) 2001 TA&lt;sub&gt;142&lt;/sub&gt; which is listed as (B0612) 2001 TA&lt;sub&gt;142&lt;/sub&gt; in the compacted lists &amp;mdash;although it is already present as [[46610 Bésixdouze]] (B612 in hexadecimal translates to 46610 in decimal notation).

===Unnamed asteroids===
Unnamed asteroids that have been given a number keep their provisional designation, e.g. [[(29075) 1950 DA]].

As modern discovery techniques have discovered vast numbers of new asteroids, they are increasingly being left unnamed. The first asteroid to be left unnamed was [[(3360) 1981 VA]]. On rare occasions, an asteroid's [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] may become used as a name in itself: the still unnamed [[(15760) 1992 QB₁]] gave its name to a group of asteroids which became known as [[cubewano]]s.

===Sources for names===
The first few asteroids were named after figures from [[Graeco-Roman mythology]], but as such names started to run out, others were used &amp;mdash;famous people, literary characters, the names of the discoverer's wives,  children, and even television characters. 

The first asteroid to be given a non-mythological name was [[20 Massalia]], named after the city of [[Marseille|Marseilles]]. For some time only female (or feminized) names were used; [[Alexander von Humboldt]] was the first man to have an asteroid named after him, but his name was feminized to [[54 Alexandra]]. This unspoken tradition lasted until [[334 Chicago]] was named; even then, oddly feminised names show up in the list for years afterward.

As the number of asteroids began to run into the hundreds, and eventually the thousands, discoverers began to give them increasingly frivolous names. The first hints of this were [[482 Petrina]] and [[483 Seppina]], named after the discoverer's pet dogs. However, there was little controversy about this until [[1971]], upon the naming of [[2309 Mr. Spock]] (which was not even named after the ''[[Star Trek]]'' character, but after the discoverer's cat who supposedly bore a resemblance to him). Although the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] subsequently banned pet names as sources, eccentric asteroid names are still being proposed and accepted, such as [[6042 Cheshirecat]], [[9007 James Bond]], or [[26858 Misterrogers]].

For a full list, see [[meanings of asteroid names]].

===Special naming rules===
Asteroid naming is not always a free-for-all: there are some types of asteroid for which rules have developed about the sources of names. For instance [[Centaur (planetoid)|Centaurs]] (asteroids orbiting between Saturn and Neptune) are all named after mythological [[centaur]]s, [[Trojan asteroid|Trojans]] after heroes from the [[Trojan War]], and [[trans-Neptunian objects]] after underworld spirits.

==Asteroid symbols==
The first few asteroids discovered were assigned symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate Earth, the Moon, the Sun and planets. The symbols quickly became ungainly, hard to draw and recognise. By the end of [[1851]] there were 15 known asteroids, each (except one) with its own symbol. The first four's main variants are shown here:

:1 Ceres [[Image:1 Ceres (0).png|15px|Old planetary symbol of Ceres]] [[Image:1 Ceres (1).png|15px|Variant symbol of Ceres]] [[Image:1 Ceres (2).png|15px|Sickle variant symbol of Ceres]] [[Image:1 Ceres (3).png|20px|Other sickle variant symbol of Ceres]]
:2 Pallas [[Image:2 Pallas (0).png|15px|Old symbol of Pallas]] [[Image:2 Pallas (1).png|15px|Variant symbol of Pallas]]
:3 Juno [[Image:3 Juno (0).png|15px|Old symbol of Juno]] [[Image:3 Juno (1).png|15px|Other symbol of Juno]]
:4 Vesta [[Image:4 Vesta (0).png|15px|Old symbol of Vesta]] [[Image:100px-Simbolo di Vesta.jpg|15px|Old planetary symbol of Vesta]] [[Image:4 Vesta (1).png|15px|Modern astrological symbol of Vesta]]

[[Johann Franz Encke]] made a major change in the ''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch'' (BAJ, &quot;Berlin Astronomical Yearbook&quot;) for [[1854]]. He introduced encircled numbers instead of symbols, although his numbering began with [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], the first four asteroids continuing to be denoted by their traditional symbols. This symbolic innovation was adopted very quickly by the astronomical community. The following year ([[1855]]), Astraea's number was bumped up to 5, but Ceres through Vesta would be listed by their numbers only in the [[1867]] edition. A few more asteroids ([[28 Bellona]], [[35 Leukothea]], and [[37 Fides]]) would be given symbols as well as using the numbering scheme.

The circle would become a pair of parentheses, and the parentheses sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades.

For details, see [[James L. Hilton]], [[2001]], [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/AsteroidHistory/minorplanets.html ''When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets?''].

==Asteroid exploration==
Until the age of [[space travel]], asteroids were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. 

The first [[close-up]] photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in [[1971]] when the [[Mariner 9]] probe imaged [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], the two small moons of [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], which are probably captured asteroids. These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did subsequent images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s.

[[Image:951 Gaspra.jpg|thumb|right|[[951 Gaspra]], the first asteroid to be imaged in close up.]]
The first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in [[1991]], followed in [[1993]] by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo probe]] ''en route'' to [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. 

The first dedicated asteroid probe was [[NEAR Shoemaker]], which photographed [[253 Mathilde]] in [[1997]], before entering into orbit around [[433 Eros]], finally landing on its surface in [[2001]].

Other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft ''en route'' to other destinations include [[9969 Braille]] (by [[Deep Space 1]] in [[1999]]), and [[5535 Annefrank]] (by [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] in [[2002]]).

In September [[2005]], the Japanese [[Hayabusa]] probe started studying [[25143 Itokawa]] in detail and will return samples of its surface to earth. Following that, the next asteroid encounters will involve the European [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta probe]] (launched in [[2004]]), which will study [[2867 Steins|2867 &amp;#352;teins]] and [[21 Lutetia]] in [[2008]] and [[2010]]. 

As a consequence of cost overruns and technical problems, [[NASA]] cancelled its [[Dawn Mission]] in March, 2006.  Dawn was originally scheduled to launch June 2006 (later rescheduled for 2007) and was to orbit both [[1 Ceres]] and [[4 Vesta]] in [[2011]]-[[2015]].

It has been suggested that asteroids might be used in the future as a source of materials which may be rare or exhausted on earth ([[asteroid mining]]).

==Asteroids in fiction and film==
Understandably, most fictional depictions of asteroids focus on their potential risk of striking Earth. Representations of the asteroid belt in film tend to make it unrealistically cluttered with dangerous rocks; in reality asteroids, even in the main belt, are spaced extremely far apart.

*[[Professor Moriarty]], [[Sherlock Holmes]]' arch-enemy, &quot;is the celebrated author of'' &quot;The Dynamics of an Asteroid&quot;'', a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it&quot; ([[The Valley of Fear]], [[1914]], set in [[1888]]).
*In ''[[The Little Prince]]'', a [[1943]] novel by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]], the [[title role|title character]] lives on an asteroid named &quot;B-6-12&quot;. The [[asteroid moon]] [[Petit-Prince (asteroid)|Petit-Prince]] was named after the character, and [[46610 Bésixdouze]] after his asteroid.
*'[[Catch that Rabbit]]', one of the short stories in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s collection ''[[I, Robot]]'' ([[1950]]), takes place on an asteroid, while ''[[Marooned Off Vesta]],'' Asimov's first published story, concerns the plight of a group of astronauts stranded in orbit around the asteroid [[4 Vesta]].
*The Japanese science fiction film ''[[Chikyu Boeigun|The Mysterians]]'' aka ''[[Chikyu Boeigun]]'' ([[1957]]) reveals the solar system's asteroid belt as the remnants of the Mysterian's home planet, Mysteroid, after a nuclear war broke out.
*In ''[[Green Slime]]'' (1968), a masterpiece of [[B-movie]]s, a rogue asteroid hurtles toward Earth. The astronauts leave [[Space station|Space Station]] Gamma 3 and place bombs on the asteroid, finding it inhabited by strange blobs of glowing slime that are drawn to the equipment. Unfortunately for everyone some of the slime was carried back on a [[space suit]] and soon evolves into tentacled creatures! See the review: [http://www.badmovies.org/movies/greenslime/]. The movie inspired the classic [[board game]] ''[[Awful Green Things from Outer Space]]''.
*In the classic science-fiction movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' ([[1968]]), the ''Discovery'' has a scientifically accurate &quot;close approach&quot; by a binary asteroid whilst en route to [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. The scene simply cuts briefly to two lone rocks passing by the ship, with tens of thousands of kilometres to spare.
* In [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]'s ''Inherit the Stars'' ([[1977]]), first book of the ''Gentle Giants'' series, Minerva was a planet that exploded to form the [[asteroid belt]] 50,000 years ago.
*The [[disaster movie]] ''[[Meteor (movie)|Meteor]]'' ([[1979]]) depicts an asteroid named Orpheus hurtling toward Earth after its orbit is deflected by a [[comet]].
*[[Atari]] released the arcade game [[Asteroids]] in [[1979]].
*In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' ([[1980]]), [[Han Solo]] enters an asteroid field to flee from the [[Empire_(Star_Wars)|Imperial]] fleet, and [[C-3PO]] thinks it is a bad idea. Han then hides his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' inside a giant asteroid; The ship is then attacked by a vast monster that lives (inexplicably) within the asteroid in the vacuum of space.
*In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[Ender's Game]]'' ([[1985]]), a school on [[433 Eros]] is dedicated to children learning to become fleet commanders.
*[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'' ([[1986]]) depicts a journey through the asteroid belt and its ominous parallels with the journey of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.
*[[L. Neil Smith]]'s novel ''Pallas'' ([[Tor Books]], [[1993]]) depicts a modernized hunting based life on the terraformed asteroid [[Pallas]] and introduces Emerson Ngu.  The book was partly insired by the 1987 article &quot;The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race&quot; written by [[Jared Diamond]]. The book also includes a brief description of a way to encapsulate the entire surface of a small body such as an asteroid to enable creating an Earthlike environment.
*[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[The Hammer of God]]'' ([[1993]]) depicts mankind's efforts to stop an asteroid named Kali from hitting the Earth. The film ''[[Deep Impact (movie)|Deep Impact]]'' ([[1998]]) was based on Clarke's novel, although in the movie, the asteroid becomes a [[comet]].
*In the [[LucasArts]] game ''[[The Dig]]'' (originally released in [[1995]]) and its novelization, the impact-threatening asteroid Attila turns out to be an alien probe.
*In the [[1998]] movie ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', aliens launch an asteroid at Earth, completely wiping out [[Buenos Aires]]. This is the opening move in the war.
*The film ''[[Armageddon (movie)|Armageddon]]'' (1998) is also about efforts to stop an asteroid hitting Earth. Its representation of an asteroid (and of space travel in general) is deeply unrealistic.
*[[Ben Bova]]'s novel series ''[[The Asteroid Wars]]'' ([[2001]]-[[2004]]) focuses on a war over the mining of the asteroid belt.
*In the [[BBC]] [[drama documentary]] ''[[Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets]]'' ([[2004]]), the ''Pegasus'' encounters a [[binary asteroid]] from much closer than expected, and dubs the rocks &quot;Hubris&quot; and &quot;Catastrophe&quot; as a result.
*An episode of the political television drama, ''[[The West Wing (television)|The West Wing]]'' entitled &quot;Impact Winter&quot; included a subplot in which the [[White House]] staff prepared for a possible asteroid strike on the Earth. (First broadcast on [[December 15]], [[2004]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally, '''to allocute''' means &quot;to speak out formally.&quot;  In the field of [[apologetics]], allocution is generally done in defense of a belief.  In politics, one may allocute before a legislative body in an effort to influence their position on an issue.  In law, it is generally meant to state specifically and in detail what one did &lt;nowiki&gt;and/or&lt;/nowiki&gt; why, often in relation to commission of a crime.

In most jurisdictions, a defendant is allowed the opportunity to allocute &amp;mdash; that is, explain himself, before sentence is passed.  Some jurisdictions hold this as an absolute right, and in its absence, a sentence may potentially be overturned, with the result that a new sentencing hearing must be held.

Allocution is sometimes required of a defendant who pleads guilty to a crime in a [[plea bargain]] in exchange for a reduced sentence.  In this instance, allocution can serve to provide closure for victims or their families.  In principle, it removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant's guilt in the matter.  However, there have been many cases in which the defendant allocuted to a crime that he did not commit, often because this is a requirement to receiving a lesser sentence.

The term &quot;allocution&quot; is generally only in use in jurisdictions in the United States, though there are similar processes in other nations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''affidavit''' is a formal sworn statement of fact, written down, signed, and witnessed (as to the veracity of the signature) by a taker of oaths, such as a [[notary public]]. The name is [[Medieval Latin]] for  ''he has declared upon oath''.

One use of affidavits is to allow evidence to be gathered from witnesses or participants that may not be available to testify in person before the court.  

In American [[jurisprudence]], it is very unusual to allow an unsupported affidavit to be entered into evidence (as the person sworn in the affidavit is not subject to cross-examination) with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter [[at bar]].  Affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated, or who cannot be located or made to appear may be accepted by the court, but usually only in the presence of [[corroborating evidence]].  A formerly written affidavit, which reflected a better grasp of the facts closer in time to the actual events, may be used to refresh a witness' recollection.  Materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence.

Some types of motions will not be accepted by a court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence, in support of the need for the motion.  In such a case, the court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion, as certain assumptions are made, to wit:  The affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes [[judicial economy]].  The lawyer is an [[officer of the court]] and knows that a false swearing by him, if found out, could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including [[disbarment]].  The lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit.



== In the United Kingdom ==
Affidavits are made by writing &quot;I (state full name) of (insert address)on this date (date in words) make oath and say as follows...&quot;.  After this has been written, the facts to be sworn are listed, in pros or in bullet points.  The document is then taken to a [[commisssioner for oaths]] (most [[solicitors]] are also commissioners for oaths).  They will then ask you to swear on a holy book particular to your faith ([[The New Testament]], [[The Old Testament]], the [[Qur'an]], etc) and ask you to verify what has been stated.

An Affidavit is of equivalent value to sworn testimony.

'''Aries''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[sheep|Ram]]'', symbol [[Image:Aries_symbol.png|20px]], [[Unicode]] ♈) is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]].  It lies between [[Pisces]] to the west and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] to the east.

== Notable features ==
Aries' stars are rather faint except for [[Alpha Arietis|&amp;alpha; Ari]] (Hamal) and [[Beta Arietis|&amp;beta; Ari]] (Sharatan). Other important stars are [[Gamma Arietis|&amp;gamma; Ari]] (Mesarthim) and [[Delta Arietis|&amp;delta; Ari]] (Botein).

[[Teegarden's star]], in Aries, is one of our sun's closest neighbours.

== Notable deep sky objects ==
The few [[deep sky object]]s in Aries are very dim. They include the [[galaxy|galaxies]] NGC 697 (northwest of &amp;beta;), NGC 772 (southeast of &amp;beta;), NGC 972 (in the constellation's northern corner), and NGC 1156 (northwest of &amp;delta;).

== Mythology ==
When including fainter stars, visible to the naked eye, the area resembles the head of a [[sheep|ram]], having a general herbivore head shape and a spiral horn.

In [[Greek mythology]], this is believed to represent the ram which carried Athamas's son [[Phrixus]] and daughter [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]] to Colchis to escape their stepmother [[Ino]]. Helle fell off into the sea which later became the Hellespont. On reaching safety, Phrixis sacrificed the ram and hung its [[golden fleece|fleece]] in the Grove of Ares, where it turned to gold and later became the quest of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. It appears that [[Babylonians]], [[Greeks]], [[Persians]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] all agreed on the name of the Ram for this [[constellation]].

The main area of the sky constituting the sign of Aries, containing part of [[Pisces]], the [[Pleiades]], and the constellation of [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], may be the origin of the myth of the girdle of [[Hippolyte]], which forms part of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Hercules]].

===Astrology===
The Western [[astrological sign]] Aries of the [[tropical zodiac]] ([[March 21]]&amp;ndash;[[April 19]]) differs from the astronomical constellation and the Hindu astrological sign of the [[Sidereal astrology|sidereal zodiac]] ([[April 19]] - [[May 13]]).

In some cosmologies, Aries is associated with the [[classical element]] [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], and thus called a fire sign (along with [[Sagittarius]] and [[Leo]]). It is the [[domicile (astrology)|domicile]] of [[Mars (god)|Mars]] and the [[Exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]] of the [[Sun]]. It is also one of the four [[Cardinal sign]]s (along with [[Libra]], [[Capricorn]], and [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]]). Its polar opposite is [[Libra]]. Each astrological sign is assigned a part of the body, viewed as the seat of its power. Aries rules the head and face. The symbol for Aries is the [[sheep|ram]].

'''Aquarius''' ([[Latin]] for the ''[[Water]]-bearer'' or ''Cup-bearer'', symbol [[Image:Aquarius_symbol_small.png|20px]], [[Unicode]] ♒) is the eleventh sign of the [[zodiac]],  situated between Capricornus and Pisces.  Its symbol is [[Image:Aquarius_symbol_small.png|20px]], representing part of a stream of water. 

Aquarius is one of the oldest recognized constellations along the zodiac, the sun's apparent path. It is found in a region often called the [[Sea (astronomy)|Sea]] due to its profusion of watery constellations such as [[Cetus]], [[Pisces]], [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], etc. Sometimes, the river Eridanus is depicted spilling from Aquarius' watering pot.

== Notable deep sky objects ==
There are three [[deep sky object]]s that are on the [[Messier object|Messier catalog]], the [[Globular Cluster M2]], [[Globular Cluster M72]], and the [[Messier Object 73|Open Cluster M73]].

Two [[planetary nebula]]e are found in Aquarius: [[NGC 7009]], called the [[Saturn Nebula]] due to its resemblance to the [[Saturn (planet)|planet]], to the southeast of &amp;eta; Aquarii; and [[NGC 7293]], the famous [[Helix Nebula]], southwest of &amp;delta; Aquarii.

== History ==
The constellation was immortalized in the [[1960s]], proclaimed the [[Age of Aquarius]]. However, there is no standard definition for astrological ages, so the age of Aquarius could begin in [[2150]] or even [[2660]], depending on the preferred definition.  Based on the modern constellation boundaries of [[Pisces]] and Aquarius, the age of Aquarius would begin around 2660.

However, with so much of modern society reflecting the qualities of Aquarius most astrologers believe that this era has begun. Mass production, electricity, flight and space travel, electronic communications including computers the Internet, even the growing movement against capitalism in favour of a more socialist system of humanitarian development are all related to the Aquarian paradigm.

== Mythology ==
The best-known myth identifies Aquarius with [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a beautiful youth with whom [[Zeus]] fell in love, and whom he (in the guise of an eagle, represented as the constellation [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]]) carried off to Olympus to be cupbearer to the gods. [[Crater (constellation)|Crater]] is sometimes identified as his cup. 

Aquarius generally resembles the figure of a man, and when considering fainter humanly visible stars, it takes on the image of a man with a bucket from which is pouring a stream. Aquarius was also identified as the pourer of the waters which flooded the earth in the [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]], in the [[Greek mythology|
