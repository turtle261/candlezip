 that is 'Mountains of Minni' (or [[Mannai]]). Pre-Christian accounts suggest that ''Nairi'', meaning ''land of rivers'', was an ancient name for the country's mountainous region, first used by [[Assyrians]] around [[1200 BC]]; while the first recorded inscription bearing the name Armenia, namely the [[Behistun Inscription]] in [[Iran]], dates from [[521 BC]].

== History ==
{{History of Armenia}}
{{main|History of Armenia}}

Armenia has been populated by humans since prehistoric times, and has been proposed as the site of the Biblical [[Garden of Eden]].

Armenia was a regional empire with a rich culture in the years leading up to the [[1st century]], spanning from the shores of the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the rule of [[Tigranes the Great]]. 

Armenia's strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples, including the [[Assyrians]], [[Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantines]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Mongols]].

In [[Anno Domini|AD]] [[301]], Armenia became the first country in the world to adopt [[Christianity]] as its official [[state religion]], twelve years before the Roman Empire granted Christianity official toleration under [[Galerius]], and some 30-40 years before Constantine was baptised.  There had been various [[paganism|pagan]] communities  before Christianity, but they were converted by an influx of Christian missionaries.  

Having changed between various dynasties -- including [[Parthian]] (Iranian), [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Byzantine]], [[Arab]], [[Mongol]] and [[Iran|Persian]] occupations -- Armenia was substantially weakened. In 1500's, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Safavid]] Persia divided Armenia among themselves.

In 1813 and 1828, present-day Armenia (consisting of the [[Erivan]] and [[Karabakh]] [[khanate]]s within Persia) was temporarily incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]]. After a short-lived independent republic established after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in [[Petrograd]], Armenia was incorporated into the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]. Between 1922 and 1936 it existed as the [[Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] (with Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan), and from 1936 to 1991 as the [[Armenian SSR]].

During the final years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] ([[1915]]-[[1922]]), a large proportion of Armenians living in [[Anatolia]] perished as a result of what is termed the [[Armenian Genocide]], regarded by Armenians and the vast majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings. Turkish authorities, however, maintain that the deaths were a result of a [[civil war]] coupled with disease and [[famine]], with casualties incurred by both sides. Most estimates for the number of Armenians killed range from [[Ottoman Armenian casualties|650,000 to 1,500,000]], and these events are traditionally commemorated yearly on [[April 24]]. Armenians and a handful of other countries worldwide have been campaigning for official recognition of the events as genocide for over 30 years, but there are also many countries who are pressured not to officially characterize the Armenian massacres as genocide.

Armenia remained preoccupied by a long conflict with [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], a mostly Armenian-populated [[enclave]] that, Armenians allege, [[Stalin]] had placed in Soviet Azerbaijan. A military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan began in 1988, and the fighting escalated after both countries gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994, when a [[cease-fire]] took hold, &lt;!--ethnic WERE THEY ETHNIC OR ARMENIAN REPUBLIC FORCES&gt;/!--&gt;Armenian forces controlled not only [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] but also the surrounding districts of Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of a peaceful resolution.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Armenia}}
The Government of Armenia's stated aim is to build a Western-style [[parliamentary democracy]] as the basis of its [[form of government]]. However, international observers have questioned the fairness of Armenia's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referenda since 1995, citing polling deficiencies, lack of cooperation by the [[Electoral Commission|electoral commission]], and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places. For the most part however, Armenia is considered one of the more pro-democratic nations in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].

The [[unicameral parliament]] (also called the National Assembly) is controlled by a coalition of three political parties: the conservative Republican party [http://www.hhk.am], the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], and the [[Country of Law]] party. The main opposition is composed of several smaller parties joined in the [[Justice Bloc]].

Armenians voted overwhelmingly for independence in a September 1991 referendum. [[Levon Ter-Petrossian]] was president until January 1998, when public demonstrations against his increasingly authoritarian regime and his domestic and foreign policies forced his resignation. In 1999, as the Prime Minister [[Vasgen Sarkissian|Vazgen Sargsian]], parliament Speaker [[Karen Demirchyan|Karen Demirchian]], and six other officials were killed in the attack on the National Assembly [http://www.aaainc.org/ArTW/article.php?articleID=468], the country experienced a period of political instability. President [[Robert Kocharian]] was successful in riding out the unrest, and currently rules with the support of the parliamentary coalition.

== Administrative Provinces ==

== Geography ==
[[Image:Armenia map.png|thumb|Map of Armenia]]
{{main|Geography of Armenia}}
Armenia is a [[landlocked]] country in the [[Transcaucasus|southern Caucasus]].  Located between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s, Armenia is bordered on the north and east by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], and on the south and west by [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].  Though geographically in Western Asia, politically and culturally Armenia is closely aligned with Europe. Historically, Armenia has been at the crossroads between Europe and Southwest Asia, and is therefore seen as a transcontinental nation.

The Republic of Armenia, covering an area of 30,000 [[square kilometre]]s (11,600&amp;nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]), is located in the north-east of the [[Armenian Highland]] (covering 400,000 sq km or 154,000&amp;nbsp;sq.&amp;nbsp;mi), otherwise known as historic Armenia and considered as the original homeland of [[Armenians]].

The terrain is mostly [[mountain|mountainous]], with fast flowing [[rivers]] and few [[forests]]. The climate is highland [[Continental climate|continental]]: hot summers and cold winters. The land rises to 4,095 [[metre]]s (13,435&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) [[above sea-level]] at [[Mount Aragats]], and no point is below 400 metres (1,312&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. [[Ararat|Mount Ararat]], regarded by the Armenians as a [[symbol]] of their land, is the highest mountain in the region and used to be part of Armenia until around 1915, when it fell to the Turks.

Armenia is trying to address its [[environment|environmental]] problems.  It has established a Ministry of Nature Protection and introduced taxes for air and water pollution and solid waste disposal, whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities.  Armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS, a group of 12 former [[Soviet]] republics) and with members of the international community on environmental issues.  The Armenian Government is working toward closing its Nuclear Power Plant at Medzamor near [[Yerevan]] as soon as alternative energy sources are identified.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Armenia}}
Until independence, Armenia's economy was largely [[industry]]-based – [[chemical]]s, [[electronics]], machinery, processed [[food]], [[synthetic rubber]], and [[textile]] – and highly dependent on outside resources.  [[Agriculture]] contributed only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Armenian mines produce [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[gold]], and [[lead]].  The vast majority of energy is produced with [[fuel]] imported from Russia, including [[gas]] and nuclear fuel (for its one [[nuclear power plant]]); the main domestic energy source is [[hydroelectric]].  Small amounts of [[coal]], gas, and [[petroleum]] have not yet been developed.

Like other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a [[centrally planned economy]] and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns.  Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function.  In addition, the effects of the 1988 [[Spitak Earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt.  The conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved.  The closure of  Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because Armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials.  Land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable.  [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] fell nearly 60% from 1989 until 1992–[[1993]].  The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in 1993.

Nevertheless, the government was able to make wide-ranging economic reforms that paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth.  The 1994 cease-fire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has also helped the economy. Armenia has had strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years.  New sectors, such as [[precious stone]] processing and [[jewelry]] making, [[information technology|information]] and [[communication technology]], and even [[tourism]] are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors in the economy, such as agriculture.

This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions.  The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD), and other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Loans to Armenia since 1993 exceed $1.1 billion.  These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation in the earthquake zone.  The government joined the [[World Trade Organization]] on [[February 5]], [[2003]]. But one of the main sources of foreign direct investments remains the Armenian diaspora, which finances major parts of the reconstruction of infrastructure and other public projects. Being a growing democratic state, Armenia also hopes to get more financial aid from the Western World.

A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a Law on Privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization.  Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and making strides against corruption.

In the 2006 [[Index of Economic Freedom]], Armenia ranked 27th best, tied with [[Japan]] and ahead of countries like [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Italy]]. However, Armenia ranked very low on property rights worse than countries like Botswana, Trinidad and Tobago.[http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/]

In the 2005 Transparency International Corruption Index Armenia ranked 88, Highly Corrupt.[http://www.transparency.org/policy_and_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005]

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Armenia}}
Armenia has a population of 2,982,904 (July 2005 est.) and is the second most densely populated of the former Soviet republics. There has been a problem of population decline due to elevated levels of [[emigration]] after the break-up of the [[USSR]]. The rates of emigration and population decline, however, have been decreasing in the recent years, a trend which is expected to continue. In fact Armenia is expected to resume its positive population growth by 2010. 

Ethnic [[Armenians]] make up 97.9% of the population. [[Kurds]] make up 1.3%, and [[Russians]] 0.5%. There are smaller communities of [[Assyrians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Most [[Azerbaijanis]], once a sizable population, have left since independence.

Nearly all of the Armenians in [[Azerbaijan]] (approximately 120,000) now live in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region. Armenia has a very large [[Armenian Diaspora|diaspora]] (8 million by some estimates, greatly exceeding the 3 million population of Armenia itself), with communities existing across the globe, including [[France]], [[Lebanon]], and [[North America]].

The predominant religion in Armenia is [[Christianity]]. The roots of the [[Armenian Church]] go back to the [[1st century|1st]] century AD. According to tradition, the [[Armenian Church]] was founded by two of Jesus' twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]]s--[[Saint Jude|Thaddaeus]] and [[Bartholomew]]--who preached Christianity in Armenia in the 40's-60's AD. Because of these two founding [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]]s, the official name of the [[Armenian Church]] is [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. Armenia was the first nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion, in AD [[301]]. Over 93% of Armenian Christians belong to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], a form of Oriental (Non-[[Chalcedonian]]) Orthodoxy, which is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the [[Coptic Church|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian]] churches. Armenia also has a population of Catholics (both Roman and Mekhitarist - Armenian Uniate (180,000)), evangelical Protestantsand followers of the Armenian traditional religion. The [[Yazidi]] [[Kurds]], who live in the western part of the country, practise [[Yazidism]]. The [[Armenian Catholic Church]] is headquartered in [[Bzoummar]], [[Lebanon]].

Ethnic [[Azeris]] and [[Kurds]] who lived in the country before the [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Karabakh]] conflict practised [[Islam]], but most Azeris were driven out of Armenia into [[Azerbaijan]] between 1988 and 1991 at the beginning of the conflict. During the same period, Armenia also received a large influx of Armenians scattered throughout Azerbaijan and large number of Azeri population migrated to Azerbaijan.

== Culture ==
[[Image:Yerewan with Ararat.jpg|thumb|right|Although located in [[Turkey]], [[Mount Ararat]], here seen from Yerevan, is the national symbol of Armenia.]]
[[Image:Mother Armenia, Yerevan, Day.jpg|thumb|right|Mother Armenia (Mayr Hayastan) statue, located near Victory Park, in Yerevan.]]
{{Main|Culture of Armenia}}
Armenians have their own highly distinctive [[Armenian alphabet|alphabet]] and [[Armenian language|language]]. 96% of the people in the country speak Armenian, while 75.8% of the population speaks [[Russian language|Russian]] as well. The adult literacy rate in Armenia is 99% [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/am.html]. Most adults in Yerevan can communicate in Russian, while [[English language|English]] is increasing in popularity.

[[Caucasus|Caucasian]] hospitality is legendary and stems from ancient tradition. Social gatherings focused around sumptuous presentations of course after course of elaborately prepared, well-seasoned (but not spicy-hot) food. The host or hostess will often put morsels on a guest's plate whenever it is empty or fill his or her glass when it gets low. After a helping or two it is acceptable to refuse politely or, more simply, just leave a little uneaten food.

The National Art Gallery in Yerevan has more than 16,000 works that date back to the [[Middle Ages]]. It houses paintings by many [[European]] masters. The Modern Art Museum, the Children’s Picture Gallery, and the [[Martiros Saryan]] Museum are only a few of the other noteworthy collections of fine art on display in Yerevan. Moreover, many private galleries are in operation, with many more opening each year. They feature rotating exhibitions and sales.

The world-class [[Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra]] performs at the beautifully refurbished city Opera House, where you can also attend a full season of opera. In addition, several chamber ensembles are highly regarded for their musicianship, including the [[National Chamber Orchestra of Armenia]] and the [[Serenade Orchestra]]. Classical music can also be heard at one of several smaller venues, including the State Music Conservatory and the Chamber Orchestra Hall. [[Jazz]] is popular, especially in the summer when live performances are a regular occurrence at one of the city’s many outdoor [[cafe|cafes]].

Yerevan’s Vernisage (arts and crafts market), close to Republic Square, bustles with hundreds of vendors selling a variety of crafts, many of superb workmanship, on weekends and Wednesdays (though the selection is much reduced mid-week). The market offers woodcarving, antiques, fine lace, and the hand-knotted wool carpets and kilims that are a Caucasus specialty. Obsidian, which is found locally, is crafted into an amazing assortment of jewelry and ornamental objects. Armenian gold smithery enjoys a long and distinguished tradition, populating one corner of the market with a selection of gold items. Soviet relics and souvenirs of recent Russian manufacture—nesting dolls, watches, enamel boxes and so on, are also available at the Vernisage.

Across from the Opera House, a popular art market fills another city park on the weekends. Armenia’s long history as a crossroads of the ancient world has resulted in a landscape with innumerable fascinating archaeological sites to explore. [[Medieval]], [[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and even [[Stone Age]] sites are all within a few hours drive from the city. All but the most spectacular remain virtually undiscovered, allowing visitors to view churches and fortresses in their original settings.

The American University of Armenia has graduate programs in Business and Law, among others. The institution owes its existence to the combined efforts of the Government of Armenia, the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]], USAID, and the Boalt Hall School of Law at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

The extension programs and the library at AUA form a new focal point for English-language intellectual life in the city. Many of the country’s most successful young entrepreneurs are graduates of this institution.

The '''Republic of Azerbaijan''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: Azərbaycan or Azərbaycan Respublikası) is a country in the [[Caucasus]], at the crossroads of [[Europe]] and [[Southwest Asia]], with a coast on the [[Caspian Sea]]. It has frontiers with [[Russia]] in the north, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the northwest, [[Armenia]] in the west, and [[Iran]] in the south. The [[Nakhichevan|Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]] (an [[exclave]] of Azerbaijan) borders Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, and [[Turkey]] to the northwest.

Azerbaijan is a secular state, and has been a member of the [[Council of Europe]] since 2001. A majority of the population are [[Shi'a Muslim]] and of Western [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] descent, known as [[Azerbaijanis]], or simply Azeris. The country is formally an emerging [[democracy]], however with strong [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule.

== Etymology ==

There are several hypotheses regarding the origins of the name &quot;Azerbaijan.&quot; The most common theory is that it is derived from &quot;Atropatan.&quot; [[Atropat]] was the [[satrap]] at the time of the [[Persian empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid dynasty]], and gained independence after [[Alexander the Great]] destroyed the Achaemenids. The region was known as ''[[Medes|Media]] Atropatia'' or ''[[Atropatene]]'' at the time.

There are also alternative opinions that the term is a slight Turkification of ''Azarbaijan'', in turn an Arabicized version of the original Persian name ''Âzarâbâdagân'', made up of ''âzar+âbadag+ân'' (''âzar''=fire; ''âbâdag''=cultivated area; ''ân''=suffix of pluralization); that it traditionally means &quot;the land of eternal flames&quot; or &quot;the land of fire&quot;, which is probabely implies [[Zoroastrian]] fire temples in this land. Some Azeri historians contend that the name is made up of four [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] components: ''az+er+bay+can'', which means &quot;the land of the brave Az people&quot; or &quot;an elevated place for the wealthy and exalted.&quot; &lt;!--please name some of these Azeri historians who so contend--&gt;

Historically, a large part of the territory of the present-day Azerbaijan Republic has been called [[Arran (Azerbaijan)|Arran]], named after Arran, a legendary founder of [[Caucasian Albania]]. However, the precise location identified by this name has shifted somewhat over time, currently referring to the lowland Karabakh plains situated between the [[Kura]] and [[Araks]] rivers.

Some opponents of the name ''Azerbaijan'' assert that it is anachronistic to use it in a historical context before 1918, because, they say, the term was first introduced by the national intelligentsia in early 20th century and later was endorsed by the Bolsheviks, with intention of claiming the northern province of [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. To substantiate this claim they state that until the early 20th century the population of present-day Azerbaijan had no clear ethnic identification and referred to themselves primarily as &quot;Muslims.&quot;

== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Azerbaijan]]''

The earliest known inhabitants of what is today Azerbaijan were the [[Caucasian Albania]]ns, a [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian]]-speaking people who appear to have been in the region prior to the host of peoples who would eventually invade the Caucasus. Historically Azerbaijan has been occupied by a variety of peoples, including [[Armenians]], [[Persians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], [[Greek Empire]], and [[Russians]].

The first state to emerge in the territory of present-day Republic of Azerbaijan was [[Mannai|Mannae]] in the 9th century [[Anno Domini|BC]], lasting until 616 BC when it was overthrown by the [[Medes]]. The satrapies of Atropatene and [[Caucasian Albania]] were established in the [[4th century BC]] and included the approximate territories of present-day Azerbaijan and southern parts of [[Dagestan]].

[[Islam]] spread rapidly in Azerbaijan following the Arab conquests in the [[7th century|7th]]&amp;ndash;[[8th century|8th centuries]]. After the power of the Arab Khalifate waned, several semi-independent states have been formed, the Shirvanshah kingdom being one of them. In the 11th century, the conquering [[Seljuk Turks]] became the dominant force in Azerbaijan and laid the ethnic foundation of contemporary [[Azerbaijanis]] or Azeri Turks. In the [[13th century|13]]&amp;ndash;[[14th century|14th centuries]], the country experienced [[Mongol]]-[[Tatars|Tatar]] invasions.

Azerbaijan was part of the [[Safavids|Safavid state]] in [[15th century|15th]]&amp;ndash;[[18th century|18th centuries]]. It also underwent a brief period of feudal fragmentation in the mid-18th to early 19th centuries, and consisted of independent khanates. Following the two wars between the [[Qajars|Qajar dynasty]] of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and the [[Russian Empire]], Azerbaijan was acquired by Russia through the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] in 1813, and the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] in 1828.

After the collapse of the Russian Empire during [[World War I]], Azerbaijan declared independence and established the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. This first Muslim republic in the world lasted only two years, from 1918 to 1920, before the [[Soviet]] [[Red Army]] invaded Azerbaijan. Subsequently, Azerbaijan became part of the [[Soviet Union]].

Azerbaijan re-established its independence upon the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Despite a [[cease-fire]] in place since 1994, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its conflict with [[Armenia]] over the predominantly ethnic Armenian [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region. Azerbaijan has lost control of 16% of its territory including Karabakh, and must support some 800,000 [[refugee]]s and internally [[displaced person]]s as a result of the conflict.

Azerbaijan is a [[presidential republic]]. The [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] are separate from the country’s law-making body. The people elect the [[president of Azerbaijan|president]] for a five-year term of office. The president appoints all [[cabinet]]-level government administrators. A fifty-member national assembly makes the country’s laws. The people of Azerbaijan elect the [[National Assembly]]. Azerbaijan has [[universal suffrage]] above the age of eighteen.

After the presidential elections of [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|October 15, 2003]], an official release of the Central Election Committee (CEC) gave [[Isa Gambar]] — leader of the largest opposition bloc, [[Bizim Azerbaycan]] (&quot;Our Azerbaijan&quot;) — 14% percent of the electorate and the second place in election. Third, with 3.6%, came [[Lala Shevket|Lala Shevket Hajiyeva]], leader of the National Unity Movement, the first woman to run in presidential election in Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and other international organizations, as well as local independent political and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s voiced concern about observed vote rigging and a badly flawed counting process.

Several independent local and international organizations that had been observing and monitoring the election directly or indirectly declared [[Isa Gambar]] winner in the [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|15 October election]]. Another view shared by many international organisations is that in reality a second tour of voting should have taken place between the two opposition candidates Isa Gambar and Lala Shevket.

*[[Human Rights Watch]] commented on [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|these elections]]: &quot;Human Rights Watch research found that the government has heavily intervened in the campaigning process in favor of Prime Minister Ilham Aliev, son of current President Heidar Aliev. The government has stacked the Central Election Commission and local election commission with its supporters, and banned local non-governmental organizations from monitoring the vote. As the elections draw nearer, government officials have openly sided with the campaign of Ilham Aliev, constantly obstructing opposition rallies and attempting to limit public participation in opposition events. In some cases, local officials have closed all the roads into town during opposition rallies, or have extended working and school hours—on one occasion, even declaring Sunday a workday—to prevent participation in opposition rallies.&quot; (source: [http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/azerbaijan/index.htm HTML format])

Azerbaijan held [[Azerbaijan parliamentary election, 2005|parliamentary elections]] on Sunday, [[6 November]] [[2005]].

== Subdivisions ==
''Main article: [[Subdivisions of Azerbaijan]]''

Azerbaijan is divided into:
*59 [[raion]]s (rayonlar; rayon &amp;ndash; singular),
*11 [[cities]] (şəhərlər; şəhər &amp;ndash; singular),
*1 [[autonomous republic]] (muxtar respublika), which itself is divided into:
**7 raions
**1 city

== Geography ==
[[Image:Map of Azerbaijan with cities.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of Azerbaijan]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Azerbaijan]]''

Azerbaijan has an [[arid]] [[climate]], except in the southeast. Temperatures vary by season. In the southeast [[lowland]], temperatures average 6°[[Celsius|C]] (43°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) in the winter and 26°C (80°F) in the summer &amp;mdash; though daily maxima typically reach 32°C (89°F). In the northern and western [[mountain range]]s, temperatures average 12°C (55°F) in the summer and &amp;ndash;9°C (20°F) in the winter.

Annual rainfall over most of the country varies from 200 to 400 millimetres (8 to 16&amp;nbsp;in) and is generally lowest in the northeast. In the far southeast, however, the climate is much moister and annual rainfall can be as high as 1300 [[millimetre]]s (51 [[inch|in]]). For most of the country, the wettest periods are in spring and autumn, with summers being the driest.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Azerbaijan]]''

The economy is largely based on [[industry]]. Industries include machine manufacture, [[petroleum]] and other [[mining]], petroleum [[refining]], [[textiles|textile]] production, and chemical processing. [[Agriculture]] accounts for one-third of Azerbaijan’s economy. Most of the nation’s farms are [[irrigation|irrigated]]. In the lowlands, farmers grow such crops as [[cotton]], [[fruit]], [[cereal|grain]], [[tea]], [[tobacco]], and many types of [[vegetable]]s. [[Silkworm]]s are raised for the production of natural [[silk]] for the clothing industry. Azerbaijan’s herders raise [[cattle]], [[domestic sheep]] and [[goat]]s near the mountain ranges. [[Seafood]] and [[fish]] are caught in the nearby [[Caspian Sea]]. Azerbaijan has a highly dynamic economy, mainly because of oil, and has a GDP growth rate of up to 11% a year.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Azerbaijan]]''

Azerbaijan has population of roughly 7,911,974 (July 2005 est.), 90.6% of whom are ethnic [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] (also called Azeris; 1999 census figures). Azeris also form about 24% of the population of [[Iran]], predominating in the northern regions of the country. Most of Armenia’s Azeri minority have left since independence and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] war. The second largest ethnic group are [[Russians]], who now form roughly 1.8% of the population, most having emigrated since independence.
The [[Talysh]], an Iranian people, predominate in the southernmost regions of the country around the Talysh mountains and across the border into Iran. Some people argue that the number of [[Talysh]] is greater than officially recorded, as many of them are counted as Azerbaijanis.
Numerous 'Dagestani' peoples live around the border with [[Dagestan]]. The main peoples are the [[Lezgis]], [[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] and the [[Tsakhur]]. Smaller groups include the [[Budukh]], [[Udi]], [[Kryts]] and [[Khinalug]]/Ketsh around the village of [[Xinaliq]]. Around the town of [[Quba]] in the north live the [[Tats]], also known as the [[Mountain Jews]], who are also to be found in Dagestan. Many Tats have emigrated to [[Israel]] in recent years, though this trend has slowed and even reversed more recently.
The country’s large Armenian population mostly fled to [[Armenia]] and to other countries with the beginning of the Armenian-Azeri conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. During the same period, Azerbaijan also received a large influx of Azerbaijanis fleeing Armenia and later [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and adjacent provinces occupied by the Armenians. Almost all of Azerbaijan’s Armenians now live in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Azerbaijan also contains numerous smaller groups, such as [[Kurds]], [[Georgians]], [[Tatars]] and [[Ukrainians]].

Most Azerbaijanis (about 60–70%) are [[Twelver Shia]] [[Islam|Muslim]]. Other [[religion]]s or  beliefs that are followed by many in the country are the orthodox [[Sunni]] Islam, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] (in Karabakh), the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and various other Christian and Muslim sects. The Tat in [[Quba]], as well as several thousand [[Ashkenazim Jews]] in Baku, follow [[Judaism]]. Adherence to religious dogmas is nominal for the majority of the population and attitudes are secular. Traditionally, villages around Baku and the [[Lenkoran]] region are considered stronghold of Shi‘ism, and in some northern regions populated by Sunni Dagestani people, the Salafi sect has gained a following. Folk Islam is widely practiced, but an organized [[Sufi]] movement is absent.

== Culture ==
''Main article: [[Culture of Azerbaijan]]''

The official language of Azerbaijan is [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], a member of the [[Oguz]] subdivision of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]], and is spoken by around 95% of the republic’s population, as well as about a third of the population of Iran. Its closest relatives in language are [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]. As a result of the language policy of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russian language|Russian]] is also commonly spoken as a second language among the urbane. There are also speakers of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in the state. Azerbaijan’s culture has long cultural roots with [[Iran]] and [[Iranian peoples]].{{fact}}

'''Amateur astronomy''', often called '''back yard astronomy''' in the US, is a [[hobby]] whose participants enjoy observing celestial objects.  It is usually associated with viewing the [[night sky]] when most celestial objects and events are visible, but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as [[sunspot]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.

Amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes, but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable [[optical telescope|telescopes]] and [[binoculars]].

== Amateur astronomy and scientific research ==

Unlike professional astronomy, scientific research is not always the ''main'' goal for many amateur astronomers.  Work of scientific merit is certainly possible, however, and many amateurs contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers very successfully.  Astronomy is often promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data. 

The majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection.  In particular, this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers.  Several organisations, such as the Center for Backyard Astrophysics [http://cba.phys.columbia.edu/], exist to help coordinate these contributions.

In particular, amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of [[variable star]]s, helping to track [[asteroid]]s, and observing [[occultation]]s to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the [[Moon]] as seen from Earth.

In the past and present, amateur astronomers have also played a major role in discovering new [[comet]]s.  Recently however, funding of projects such as the [[LINEAR|Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] and [[Near Earth Asteroid Tracking]] projects has meant that ''most'' comets are now discovered by automated systems, long before it is possible for amateurs to see them. 

A newer role for amateurs is searching for overlooked phenomena (e.g. [[Kreutz Sungrazers]]) in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by Earth and space based observatories, much of which is available over the Internet.

== Societies for amateur astronomy ==

There are a large number of [[astronomical society|amateur astronomical societies]] around the world that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy, whether they be people who are actively interested in observing or &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; who may be simply interested in the topic.  Societies range widely in their goals, depending on a variety of factors such as geographic spread, local circumstances, size and membership.  For instance, a local society in the middle of a large city may have regular meetings with speakers, focusing less on observing the night sky if the membership is less able to observe due to factors such as [[light pollution]].

It is common for local societies to hold regular meetings, which may include activities such as [[star party|star parties]].  Other activities could include [[amateur telescope making]], which was pioneered in America by [[Russell W. Porter]], who later played a major role in design and construction of the [[Hale Telescope]].

== Approaches to using amateur telescopes ==

Amateur telescopes come in many shapes and sizes, both commercial and home-built.  The preferences of people who use them often differ.

=== Star hopping ===

Some amateur astronomers prefer to learn the sky as accurately as they can, using maps to find their way between the stars.  In this case a common approach is to use binoculars or a manually driven telescope, combined with star maps, to locate items of interest in the sky.  The normal technique for doing this, by locating landmark stars and &quot;hopping&quot; between them, is called [[star hopping]].

=== GOTO telescopes ===

More recently as technology has improved and prices have come down, automated &quot;GOTO&quot; telescopes have also become a popular choice.  With these computer-driven telescopes, the user typically enters the name of the item they wish to look at, and the telescope finds it in the sky automatically with comparatively little further effort required by the user.

The main advantage of a &quot;GOTO&quot; telescope for an experienced amateur astronomer is the reduction of &quot;wasted&quot; time that may have otherwise been used in trying to find a particular object.  This time can therefore be used more effectively for ''studying'' the object.

=== Comparing methodologies ===

There is significant (though usually light-hearted) debate within the hobby about which method is better.  Promoters of the [[star hopping]] approach for finding items in the sky usually argue that they know the sky much better as a result.  The manual method also tends to require simpler equipment with less calibration and setup time, and is therefore more versatile.  Promoters of &quot;GOTO&quot; telescopes often argue that they are more interested in studying objects, and the reward of finding them or learning exactly where they are is not as important to them.

It may also be argued that the money spent on complex electronics and mounting systems might be better spent on higher quality optics.

== Additional tools and activities ==

In addition to optical equipment, amateur astronomers use a variety of other tools such as celestial maps, and specialised computer software.  There is a range of [[astronomy software]] available, from planetarium programs that simulate the sky to programs used to do various kinds of calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena.

Most amateur astronomers also keep a record of their observations. This can take the form of an [[astronomical observing log|observing log]], in which they record details about which objects were observed and describing the details that were seen. [[Astrophotography]] and sketching are also popularly used to record observations.

== Beginning in amateur astronomy ==

There are a many ways for people to become involved in amateur astronomy and study the night sky.  One option is to join a local [[astronomical society]], the members of which will often be very happy to help a newcomer take a more active part.  Some people also prefer to simply teach themselves, in which case there are likely to be a large amount of books in the local library.

Common objects that are observed early are the [[Moon]] and [[planet]]s.  Another thing that most newcomers to amateur astronomy become acquainted with are the more prominent [[constellation]]s in the night sky.  When reading maps and interpreting instructions for future [[star hopping]], constellations are good starting points for identifying locations in the night sky.  They are frequently referred to by amateur astronomers when discussing the location of items of interest when looked at with binoculars and telescopes.

=== Beginning with a GOTO telescope ===

A relatively new ''type'' of beginning amateur astronomer, brought about by the increased affordability of powerful &quot;GOTO&quot; telescopes, is one who begins with such a telescope.  It is possible for an inexperienced person to immediately look at a large amount of deep sky objects in the night sky without necessarily having any prior experience or training.

There is currently some debate among amateur astronomers about the merits of this approach to becoming involved in the hobby, and the effects that low-priced GOTO telescopes may be having.  Amateur astronomy is exposed to more people, as an individual is less likely to be discouraged by the need to learn how to locate objects in the night sky before being able to see them.  Some are concerned, however, that newcomers may become bored very quickly.  A GOTO telescope does not distinguish between objects that are easy and hard to see, and newcomers may therefore begin with objects that require large amounts of experience or understanding to properly appreciate.

=== Becoming acquainted with the night sky ===

Most tutors agree that it is very important to know one's way around the sky by means of the constellations. This ability forms a platform from which deeper explorations of the sky are then possible. 

A planisphere can be used to find and identify the constellations.  These devises show the location of the constellations for any time of the night or time of the year. An observer will also need a red flashlight to read star charts or the planisphere.  Use of a red light helps preserve the dark adaptation of the eyes.   

Having learned the main constellations, a beginner may want to extend their hobby and buy a pair of binoculars or a telescope.

==== Using binoculars ====

With [[binoculars]] it is possible to see many [[deep sky object]]s (DSOs). Holding the binoculars can produce a shaky image. One way to improve the view is with the aid of a sturdy tripod mount to steady the view through the binoculars. Binoculars are still limited in range, although most of the [[Messier]] catalogue should be visible, as well as a great many [[New General Catalogue|NGC]]'s, especially near the [[Milky Way]]. An advantage of binoculars is that they allow more complete wide field views of the larger [[open clusters]] such as the [[Pleiades]], the [[Hyades]], the [[Coma Berenices]] cluster and [[Praesepe]], for example, of which only portions are usually observable in one [[field of view]] at higher magnifications.

==== Using a telescope ====

With a telescope, the sky really comes alive, especially one that has an [[aperture]] of six inches or more. Some amateur telescopes are [[telescope making|built]] by their owners from scratch, but many good quality telescopes can be purchased from reputable companies. Thousands of DSOs are visible in a telescope and the determined amateur with a large (about 41 cm) telescope can push this to tens of thousands or more.

Another type of telescope to consider, especially if the amateur is observing with children, is a wide-field telescope, such as Edmund Scientific's f/4 Astroscan compact [[Reflecting_telescope|reflector]]. This type of telescope is typically a short tube [[reflector telescope|reflector]] and has an [[aperture]] of only 80 to 120 mm (3 1/4 to 4 3/4 inches), but is easier to target an object, since it offers a much wider field of view.  With the aid of high power lenses (i.e. eyepieces), the amateur can zoom in on planets and some of the closer DSOs.  It is the best of a blend of a telescope's narrow long range light gathering ability with a binocular's wider field of view.  

Those who are particularly interested in observing the moon and planets may prefer a high-power design such as the [[Maksutov telescope]].

With any telescope, though, the mount is the most important feature.  A tripod that doesn't shake every time one uses it is a must.  Too many amateur astronomers give up because they have a hard time targeting an object.  If the mounting tripod is rock solid, the amateur can enjoy their time observing the heavens instead of fighting with the telescope.

==== Astrophotography ====
[[Image:Comet_Hale_Bopp_reduced.jpg|thumbnail|right|A photo taken of Comet Hale Bopp using a standard [[35 mm film|35 mm]] camera with a 50 mm lens and 400 ISO film.  The exposure was taken for 10 seconds on a tripod using a shutter cable release.]]

The next step in an amateur astronomer's quest for more space adventure could be the purchase of a good camera for [[Astrophotography]].  Starting out with a good 35 mm camera with a 50 mm lens mounted on a tripod and using a cable release and 400 or faster speed film, the amateur can capture some nice pictures of the planets and some larger nebula, like the [[Orion Nebula]].  Some of the larger comets and prolific meteor showers can be photographed this way as well.

As one progresses, cameras can be mounted directly on to telescopes, capturing on film many DSOs.  Special films and even the technique of hypering the film has been employed by the amateur.  Many  publications accept these astrophotos in their [[magazines]], [[i.e.]], ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' and ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]''.

A more recent development is the use of [[webcam|webcams]] to do [[speckle imaging]] (also known as ''video astronomy''). The resulting short exposure frames can be stacked using the [[shift-and-add]] method of [[speckle imaging]] or selected to do [[lucky imaging]], all using commercially available astronomy software.

==== Sketching ====
As an alternative to photography in order to make a record of observations, amateurs also use sketching. Sketching does not require the use of any specialized equipment and is therefore suitable for beginners as well as advanced amateur observers. There are different approaches to sketching that require different tools, simple pencil sketches can sometimes be used to make accurate renditions of what the observer sees through binoculars or a telescope. As the expewrience of the observer increases, more advanced drawing tools and techniques can be employed.

Sketching has the advantage of helping the observer scrutinize the object that is seen and can help bring out details that otherwise might have been overlooked.

'''Aikido''' (合気道 ''Aikidō'', also 合氣道 using an older style of [[kanji]]), literally meaning 'joining energy way', is a [[gendai budo]] — a modern [[Japan]]ese [[martial art]]. Practitioners of Aikido are known as '''aikidoka'''. It was developed by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] (植芝盛平) (also known by Aikidoka as [[o-sensei]] (翁先生) over the period of the [[1930s]] to the [[1960s]]. Technically, the major parts of Aikido are derived from [[Daito Ryu|Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu]] (大東流合気柔術), a form of Jujutsu with many joint techniques, and [[kenjutsu]] (剣術), or Japanese sword technique (some believe the tactics in Aikido are especially influenced by [[Yagyu Shinkage-ryu|Yagyū Shinkage-ryū]]). Aikido is also considered to contain a significant [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component.

==History==
The name aikido is formed of three Japanese characters, 合気道, usually romanised as ai, [[qi|ki]] and [[do]]. These are often translated as meaning union, universal energy and way, so aikido can be translated as 'the way to union with universal energy'. Another common interpretation of the characters is harmony, spirit and way, so Aikido can also mean 'the way of spiritual harmony'. Both interpretations draw attention to the fact that aikido's techniques are designed to control an attacker by controlling and redirecting their energy instead of blocking it. An analogy is often made of the way a flexible willow bends with the storm, whereas the stout oak will break if the wind blows too hard. (The Korean [[martial arts|martial art]] commonly known as [[hapkido]] uses the same three characters: some suggest a historical link through [[Daito-ryu]], the main origin of aikido).

Morihei Ueshiba developed aikido mainly from Daito-ryu [[aikijutsu]], incorporating training movements such as those for the ''[[yari]]'' ([[spear]]), ''[[jo (weapon)|jo]]'' (a short [[quarterstaff]]), and perhaps also ''juken'' ([[bayonet]]).  But arguably the strongest influence is that of the [[katana]] ([[sword]]).  In many ways, an aikido practitioner moves as an empty handed swordsman.  The aikido strikes ''shomenuchi'' and ''yokomenuchi'' originated from weapon attacks, and resultant techniques likewise from weapon take-aways.  Some schools of aikido do no weapons training at all; others, such as [[Iwama Ryu]] usually spend substantial time with ''[[bokken]]''/bokuto (wooden sword), ''[[jo (weapon)|jo]]'', and ''[[tanto]]'' (knife). In some lines of aikido, all techniques can be performed with a sword as well as unarmed. 

Aikido was first brought to the West in [[1951]] by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] with a visit to [[France]]. It was introduced to the [[United States]] in [[1953]] by [[Kenji Tomiki]] and, a little later in the same year by [[Koichi Tohei]].  The [[United Kingdom]] followed in [[1955]], [[Germany]] and [[Australia]] in [[1965]].  Today there are many aikido [[dojo]]s available to train at throughout the world.

==Technique==
Aikido incorporates a wide range of techniques which use principles of energy and motion to redirect, neutralise and control attackers. One of the central martial philosophies of aikido is to be able to handle multiple-attacker circumstances fluidly. ''[[Randori]]'', practice against multiple opponents, is a key part of the curriculum in most aikido schools and is required for the higher level belts. Another tenet of aikido is that the aikidoka should gain control of their opponent as quickly as possible, while causing the least amount of damage possible to either party. If performed correctly, size and strength are not important for the techniques to be effective.

===Training===
The methods of training vary from organisation to organisation, and indeed even between different [[dojo]] in a single organisation. Typically, however, a class consists of a teacher demonstrating techniques or principles which the students then practice. Training is done through mutual technique, where the focus is on entering and blending (harmonising) with the attack, rather than on meeting force with force. ''Uke'', the receiver of the technique, usually initiates an attack against ''nage'' (also referred to as ''tori'' or ''shite'' depending on Aikido style), who neutralises it with an aikido technique. The uke and the nage have equally important roles.  Uke's role is to be honest and committed in attack, to use positioning to protect oneself, and to learn proper technique through the imbalanced feeling created by nage's technique.  Nage's role is to blend with and neutralise uke's attack without leaving an opening to further attacks.  Simultaneously nage will be studying how to create a feeling of being centred (on balance) and controlled in the application of the Aikido technique.  Therefore, students must practise both positions in order to learn proper technique. When O-Sensei taught, all his students were uke until he deemed them knowledgeable enough of the technique to be nage. Movement, awareness, precision, distance and timing are all important to the execution of techniques as students progress from rigidly defined exercises to more fluid and adaptable applications.  Eventually, students take part in ''jiyu-waza'' (free attack) and/or [[randori]], where the attacks are less predictable.  Most schools employ training methods wherein uke actively attempts to employ counter-techniques, or ''kaeshi-waza''.  

O-Sensei did not allow competition in training because some techniques were considered too dangerous and because he believed that competition did not develop good character in students. Most styles of aikido continue this tradition although [[Tomiki Aikido|Shodokan Aikido]] (see [[#Styles|Styles]]) started with competitions early on. In the [[Ki Society]] there are forms (''[[taigi]]'') competitions held from time to time.

====Defense====
Aikido techniques are largely designed towards keeping the attacker off balance and locking joints. Much of aikido's repertoire of defenses can be performed either as throwing techniques (''nage-waza'') or as pins (''katame-waza''), depending on the situation. Entering, ''irimi'', and turning, ''tenkan'', are widely used aikido concepts, as is striking, ''atemi''. The use of striking techniques is dependent on the organization and, to some extent, the individual dojo. Some dojo teach the strikes that are integral to all aikido techniques as mere distractions used to make the application of an aikido technique easier, while others teach that strikes are to be used for more destructive reasons. O-Sensei himself wrote, while describing the aikido technique ikkyo, &quot;...first smash the eyes.&quot; (This might well refer to the fact that the classic opener for ikkyo is a knife-hand thrust towards the face, to make uke block and thus expose his or her arm to the joint control - thus, ''as though'' moving to smash uke's eyes.)  Manipulation of uke's balance by entering is often referred to as &quot;taking uke's center&quot;. It is sometimes said that Aikido contains only defense, and the attacks that are performed are not really aikido. From a historical perspective this claim is questionable, but many if not most aikidoka have the defense techniques as the focus of their training.

====Attacks====
In the early days when Ueshiba began teaching to the public, students tended to be proficient in another martial art. Due to this, attacks per se are generally not focused on in contemporary aikido dojos. Students will learn the various attacks from which an Aikido technique can be practiced. Although attacks seldom are studied to the same extent as some arts, good attacks are needed to study correct and effective application of technique. &quot;Honest&quot; attacks are considered important. An &quot;honest&quot; attack would be an attack with full intention or a strong neutral (neither pulling or pushing) grab or hold. The speed of an attack may vary depending on the experience and level of the &quot;nage&quot; (the partner who executes the throw or technique). Whether the attack is fast or slow, the uke's intention to strike or control (if grabbing or pinning) should remain, in order to provide the nage a realistic training scenario. 

Aikido attacks used in normal training include various stylized strikes and grabs such as ''shomenuchi'' (a vertical strike to the head), ''yokomenuchi'' (a lateral strike to the side of the head and/or neck), ''munetsuki'' (a straight punch), ''ryotedori'' (a two handed grab) or ''katadori'' (a shoulder grab).  Many of the ''-uchi'' strikes resemble blows from a sword or other weapon.  Kicks are sometimes used, but are not usually part of basic curricula.   Most aikido techniques can also be applied to a response to an attack, e.g. to a block, and some schools use this as the &quot;basic&quot; form of a given class of technique.  Beginners also tend to work with techniques executed in response to a grab.  Grabs are considered good for basic practice because the connection with uke is very clear and strong, and it is easier to &quot;feel out&quot; body mechanics and lines of force.

There is also the matter of ''atemi'', or strikes employed during an aikido technique.  The role and importance of atemi is a matter of some debate in aikido. Some view atemi as strikes to &quot;vital points&quot; that can be delivered during the course of a technique's application, to increase effectiveness.   Others consider atemi to be methods of distraction, particularly when aimed at the face.  For instance, if a movement would expose the aikido practitioner to a counter-blow, he or she may deliver a quick strike to distract the attacker or occupy the threatening limb.  (Such a strike will also usually break the target's concentration, making them easier to throw than if they are able to focus on resisting.)  Atemi can be interpreted as not only punches or kicks but also, for instance, striking with a shoulder or a large part of the arm. Some throws are arguably effected through an unbalancing or abrupt application of atemi.  [http://www.tsuki-kage.com/ueshiba.html Many sayings about atemi] are attributed to [[Morihei Ueshiba]], although their precise content varies considerably based on the one doing the telling.

====Weapons====
Weapons training in aikido usually consists of [[jo (weapon)|jo]] (4-foot staff), [[bokken]] (wooden sword), and wooden (or sometimes rubber) [[tanto]] (knife).  Both weapons-taking and weapons-retention are sometimes taught, to integrate the armed and unarmed aspects of aikido.  For example, a technique done with a straight punch may be done with a tanto or jo thrust instead, or a grab technique may be illustrated as a way to draw/strike with a weapon while being grabbed.

Many schools use versions of [[Morihiro Saito]]'s weapons system: aiki-jo and aiki-ken. The system contains solo [[Kata (martial arts)|kata]] with jo, and paired exercises for both jo and bokken. Some lineages use bokken kata derived from older sword schools. Also, quite a few aikido teachers, such as [[Mitsugi Saotome]] and [[Kazuo Chiba]], have developed their own weapons systems.  This is largely due to the fact that O'Sensei did not teach weapons to his students, excepting a few.

===Clothing===
The [[aikidogi]] used in Aikido is similar to the [[keikogi]] used in most other modern [[budo]] arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. In some places a keikogi of [[karate]] cut is preferred, in others most people use [[judo]] keikogis. Keikogi made specially for aikido exist, but usually not in the lower price ranges. Many dojos insist that the sleeves are cut short to elbow length, to reduce the risk of trapped fingers and injuries in grab techniques to the wrist.

To the keikogi adds the traditional garment [[hakama]], wide pleated trousers. The hakama is usually black or dark blue and in most dojos, the hakama is reserved for practitioners with dan (black belt) ranks. Systems also exist where hakama is never worn or are worn from a specific kyu rank; others exist where women are allowed to wear it earlier than men.

The belt, ''obi'' is wrapped twice around the body similar to in karate or judo. Although some systems use many belt colours similar to the system in judo, the most common version is that dan ranks wear black belt, and kyu ranks white - sometimes with an additional brown belt for the highest kyu ranks. In some dojos it is common to have the same color belt at different levels.

==Spirituality==
The ending &quot;[[do]]&quot; in the word aikido indicates a spiritual path, unlike the ending &quot;jutsu&quot; in the word aikijujutsu, which indicates a system of techniques. Many people see this difference as important as well as regarding [[iaido|iaijutsu]] and [[iaido]], [[jujutsu]] and [[judo]], and [[kenjutsu]] and [[kendo]]. Others see this distinction as a historically incorrect and somewhat unnatural division.  For example, literally, do refers to a path and jitsu to a technique: therefore, some argue, aikido involves both a way (do) and technical study (jutsu).

Ueshiba taught that, while it was important to become proficient in physical technique, this is not the ultimate purpose of training. He taught that the principles learned through training in physical technique are universal and are to be applied to all aspects of one's life. He once commented that he was teaching students not how to move their feet but, rather, how to move their minds.

Many agree that Ueshiba's style became softer, more fluid, and effortless as he grew older. Some suggest this was due to a shift in focus to the spiritual aspects of the art, while others suggest that this was simply a natural result of Ueshiba becoming more proficient in physical technique. Various interpretations have arisen since Ueshiba's death.

A range of aikido schools can be found, each placing a different emphasis on physical techniques, underlying principles, and spiritual concepts. This is largely a result of at what point the founder of each of these schools trained with Ueshiba--earlier or later in Ueshiba's life. The former tend to focus more on physical technique, while the latter tend to focus more on spiritual concepts.  However, this should not be overstated, especially since there is considerable variance from sensei to sensei, and an &quot;aikido continuum&quot; is quite problematic to actually construct.  Some aikidoka view &quot;physical vs. spiritual&quot; as a false separation, or a failed attempt to stereotype branches of aikido.

[[Ki Society]] is an example of a school that focuses heavily on the spiritual concepts of aikido, rather than physical technique. 

===Ki===
[[Image:ki-obsolete.png|left|float|200px|Obsolete form of the ki kanji]]
The Japanese character for [[Qi|ki]], is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice. The steam being contained within, is ki. This same word is applied to the ability to harness one's own 'breath power', 'power', or 'energy'. This 'ki' is the same as the 'qi' in [[Qigong|qi-gong]], but many people argue it is not the same as the 'chi' in [[Tai Chi Chuan|t'ai chi]]. When [[aikidoka]] say that someone is training with a lot of ki, they usually want to express that the person is very non-forcefully compelling in the execution of his technique. Timing, a sense for the correct distance and a centered (undisturbed) mind and body are particularly important. Most teachers claim to locate ki in the [[hara (Martial Arts)|hara]], which might be loosely defined as the body's center of gravity, situated in the lower abdomen, about two inches below and behind the navel. In training it is constantly emphasized that one should keep one's hara — that is, remain ''centered''. Very high ranking teachers sometimes reach a level of coordination that enables them to execute techniques with very little apparent movement, sometimes even without seeming to touch their opponent's body.

Essentially, ki corresponds to the physical concepts of center of gravity, center of momentum, and center of force.  However, these centers are not necessarily the same, so ki also encompasses the biological and mental aspect of training oneself to have exquisite control over motion.

The &quot;spiritual&quot; interpretation of ki depends very much on what school of aikido one studies, as some emphasize it more than others.  Ki Society dojos, for example, tend to spend much more time on ki-related training activities than do, for example, Yoshinkan dojos.  The importance of ki in aikido cannot be denied -- the name of the martial art, after all, can be translated as &quot;the meeting of ki&quot;.  But what ki is, is debated by many within the discipline.  O-Sensei himself appears to have changed his views over time -- for example, Yoshinkan Aikido, which largely follows O-Sensei's teachings from before the war, is considerably more martial in nature, reflecting a younger, more violent and less spiritual O-Sensei.  Within this school, ki perhaps could be better thought of as having its original Chinese meaning of breath, and aikido as coordination of movement with breath to maximize power.  As O-Sensei evolved and his views changed, his teachings took on a much more ethereal feel, and many of his later students (almost all now high ranking senseis within the Aikikai) teach about ki from this perspective.

==Body==
Aikido training is for all-around physical fitness, flexibility, and [[relaxation]].  The human body in general can exert power in two ways: contractive and expansive (aikidofaq.com).  Many fitness activities, for example weight-lifting, emphasize the former, which means that specific muscles or muscle groups are isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, and power.  The disadvantage of this, however, is that whole body movement and coordination are rarely stressed.  Thus, while muscle size and power may increase, there is no emphasis on the ways in which those muscles can work together most efficiently.  Also, this sort of training tends to increase tension, decrease flexibility, and stress the joints.  The result may be aesthetically pleasing, but when done to excess may actually be detrimental to overall health. 

The second type of power, expansive, is mostly stressed in activities such as dance or gymnastics.  In these activities, the body must learn to move in a coordinated manner and with relaxation. Aikido also mostly stresses this sort of training.  While both types of power are important, it is interesting to note that a person who masters the second type of power can, in a martial context, often overcome a person who is much bigger or stronger.   The reason for this is that the contractive power is only as great as the mass and power of your individual muscles.  Expansive power, however, as used in Aikido, can be much greater than your size may lead you to believe.  This is because you move with your whole body.  Rather than stressing and tensing only a few muscles, you learn to relax and move from the center of your body, where you are most powerful.  Power is then extended out naturally through the relaxed limbs, which become almost whip-like in their motion. Needless to say, the power behind an entire person's body will be more than that of someone's arm or leg alone.

Hence, aikido develops the body in a unique manner.  Aerobic fitness is obtained through vigorous training.  Flexibility of the joints and connective tissues is developed through various stretching exercises and through the techniques themselves.  [[Relaxation]] is learned automatically, since without it the techniques will not function.  A balanced use of contractive and expansive power is mastered, enabling even a small person to pit his entire body's energy against their opponent.

With this, different masters stress different aspects of training. Some masters stress importance of body posture while executing the technique in order to coordinate different parts of the body, while others deal with the physical aspects of it. With each way, comes a different means of interpretation of the same basic principles of the art which is discussed in more detail above.

==Mind==
Aikido training does not consider the body and mind as independent entities. The condition of one affects the other. For example, the physical relaxation learned in aikido also becomes a mental relaxation. Likewise, the confidence that develops mentally is manifested in a more confident style. [[Psychological]] or spiritual insight learned during training must become reflected in the body, else it will vanish under pressure, when more basic, ingrained patterns and reflexes take over. Aikido training requires the student to squarely face conflict, not to run away from it.  Through this experience, an Aikido student may learn to face other areas of life in a similarly proactive fashion, rather than in with avoidance and fear.

==Styles==
The major styles of aikido each have their own [[Hombu Dojo]] in [[Japan]], have an international breadth and were founded by direct students of [[Morihei Ueshiba]].  Although there has been an explosion of &quot;independent styles&quot; generally only the first five listed have been considered major.  [[Iwama style|Iwama Ryu]] is a debatable sixth as, although its influence is major, it has until recently been part of the [[Aikikai]] (see below).

* [[Aikikai]] is the largest aikido organisation, and is led by the family of the founder. Numerous sub-organisations and teachers affiliate themselves with this umbrella organisation, which therefore encompasses a wide variety of aikido styles, training methods and technical differences. These sub-organisations are often centred around prominant [[Shihan]] and are usually organised at the national level, although sub-national and inter-national sub-organisations exist.  Please see [[List of famous aikidoka]] for more detail.

*[[Yoshinkan]] Founded by [[Gozo Shioda]], has a reputation for being the most rigidly precise. Students of Yoshinkan aikido practise basic movements as solo kata, and this style has been popular among the Japanese police.  The international organization associated with the Yoshinkan style of aikido is known as the Yoshinkai, and has active branches in many parts of the world.

*[[Yoseikan]] was founded by [[Minoru Mochizuki]], who was an early student of O-Sensei and also of Jigoro Kano at the [[Kodokan]].   This style includes elements of aiki-budo together with aspects of karate, judo and other arts. It is now carried on by his son, [[Hiroo Mochizuki]], the creator of [[Yoseikan Budo]].

*[[Tomiki Aikido|Shodokan Aikido]] (often called Tomiki aikido, after its founder) use sparring and rule based competition in training as opposed to most others. People tend to compete to train rather than to train to compete.  [[Kenji Tomiki]], an early student of O-Sensei and also of judo's [[Jigoro Kano]], believed that introducing an element of competition would serve to sharpen and focus the practice since it was no longer tested in real combat. This latter view was the cause of a split with O-Sensei's family who firmly believed that there was no place for competition in aikido training.  Tomiki said that at no point did O-Sensei actually cast him out.  

*The [[Ki Society]], founded by former head-instructor of the Hombu dojo 10th dan [[Koichi Tohei]], emphasizes very soft flowing techniques and has a special program for the development of [[ki]]. It also has a special system of ki-ranks alongside the traditional [[kyu]] and [[dan]] system. This style is called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]] (or [[Ki-Aikido]]). 

*[[Iwama style|Iwama Ryu]] emphasizes the relation between weapon techniques and barehand techniques, and a great deal of emphasis is placed on weapons training. Since the death of its founder [[Morihiro Saito]], the [[Iwama style]] has been practiced by clubs within the Aikikai and an independent organization headed by [[Hitohiro Saito]]. Saito sensei was a long time uchideshi of O-Sensei, beginning in 1946 and staying with him through his death. Many consider that Saito sensei was the student who spent most time directly studying with O-Sensei. Saito sensei said he was trying to preserve and teach the art exactly as the founder of aikido taught it to him. Technically, Iwama-ryu seems to resemble the aikido O-Sensei was teaching in the early 50s mainly in the Iwama dojo. The technical repertoire is fairly large.  The new, separate from Aikikai, Iwama Ryu Aikido has been renamed Iwama Shin Shin Aikishurenkai. 

*[[Shin'ei Taido]] Founded by the late [[Noriaki Inoue]], nephew of [[Morihei Ueshiba]].    

*[[Yoshokai]] aikido, begun by then-hachidan Takashi Kushida of Yoshinkan aikido, is a remarkably centralized style of aikido, with test techniques yearly passed down with explanations from the home dojo.  The syllabus contains a considerable amount of weapons study, and like Yoshinkan, Yoshokai includes many solo movements and exercises.

*[[Doshinkan]] aikido, begun by Yukio Utada of Yoshinkan aikido.  Utada was a student of both the Yoshinkan founder Gozo Shioda and Yoshokai founder Takashi Kushida. Like Yoshokai, the syllabus also contains a considerable amount of weapons study, and like Yoshinkan, Doshinkan includes many solo movements and exercises. Doshinkan Aikido (Aikido Association of North America and Doshinkan Aikido International) is still affiliated with the International Yoshinkan Aikido Federation.

*[[Tendo-ryu Aikido|Tendoryu Aikido]] Headed by [[Kenji Shimizu]].

*[[Shin Budo Kai]] headed by [[Shizuo Imaizumi]].

*[[Kokikai]] aikido, founded by [[Shuji Maruyama]] in 1986, focuses on minimalist but effective technique.  It emphasizes natural stances and [[ukemi]] that do not require high [[breakfalls]], and deemphasizes [[atemi]] and techniques that cause pain or undue discomfort to [[uke]].  As such, it is considered by some to be a &quot;soft&quot; style of aikido.

*[[Seidokan]] Aikido, founded by [[Rod Kobayashi]].  Tends to utilize movements which are very small and economical.  Encourages students to discover an aikido which is truly their own, stresses the importance of doing away with the extraneous and focusing on that which works

*[[Nippon Kan]] Headed by [[Gaku Homma]].

*[[Nishio AIkido]] a part of the Aikikai although techically well defined according to its head [[Shoji Nishio]]. Nishio Sensei passed away in March 2005.

*[[Nihon Goshin Aikido]] Headed by Richard Bowe. It is considered a &quot;hard&quot; style of aikido, combining techniques from karate, Judo and Daito-Ryu Aikijutsu. There are roughly a dozen dojos in the United States and none left in Japan. Founded by Shoto Morita in Japan circa 1950. Derivative styles include Nihon Goshin Aikijutsu founded by Walter Kopitov in 2000. For more information see &quot;The Black Belt Master Course in Nihon Goshin Aikido&quot;.

*[[Takemusu Aiki Tomita Academy]]. Academy for the development of Takemusu Aiki founded in 1992 by [[Takeji Tomita]].  This training method incorporates [[Tai-Jutsu]], [[Aiki-Ken]] and [[Aiki-Jo]] for the study of the inter-related principles of Takemusu Aiki and Japanese [[Budo]].

*[[Aiki Manseido]] Headed by [[Kanshu Sunadomari]].  Independent style centred in [[Kyushu]], Japan.

==Aikidoka==
It is sometimes said that in  [[Japan]] the term ''aikidoka'' (合気道家) mainly refers to a [[professional]] while in the west, any one who practices may call themselves an aikidoka. The term ''aikidoist'' is also used as a more general term, especially by those who prefer to maintain the more restricted, Japanese, meaning of the term aikidoka.

By its original and broadest definition, '''''[[art]]''''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ars'', meaning &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;craft&quot;) is the product or process of the effective application of a body of knowledge and a set of skills; this meaning is preserved in such phrases as &quot;[[liberal arts]]&quot; and &quot;[[martial arts]]&quot;. However, in the modern use of the word, which rose to prominence during the [[Renaissance]], ''art'' is commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works (or '''artwork''') which, from concept to creation, adhere to the &quot;[[creativity|creative]] impulse&quot;&amp;mdash;that is, art is distinguished from other works by being in large part unprompted by necessity, by biological drive, or by any undisciplined pursuit of [[recreation]]. By both definitions of the word, artistic works have existed for almost as long as [[human|humankind]], from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]].

The '''creative arts''' are a collection of disciplines whose principal purpose is in the output of material that is compelled by a personal drive and echoes or reflects a message, mood, and [[symbolism]] for the viewer to interpret. As such, the term ''art'' may be taken to include forms as diverse as [[prose]] [[writing]], [[poetry]], [[dance]], [[acting]], [[music]], [[sculpture]] and [[painting]]. In addition to serving as a method of pure creativity and self-expression, the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically-, religiously-, and philosophically-motivated art, to create a sense of [[beauty]] (see ''[[aesthetics]]'' and ''[[fine art]]'') or pleasure, or to generate strong [[emotion]]s; the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

As a form of [[culture|cultural]] expression, art may be defined by the pursuit of [[diversity]] and the usage of [[narrative]]s of liberation and exploration (i.e. [[art history]], [[art criticism]], and [[art theory]]) to mediate its boundaries. This distinction may be applied to objects or performances, current or historical, and its prestige extends to those who made, found, exhibit, or own them. Other than originality, there are no widely agreed-upon criteria for what is or isn't considered &quot;art&quot;, and there are many divergent definitions of ''art'' to seek more specific requirements.

==Etymology==
The word ''art'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''ars'', which roughly translates to &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;craft&quot;, and derives in turn from an [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European root]] meaning &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange&quot;. This is the only near-universal definition of art: that whatever is described as such has undergone a deliberate process of arrangement by an agent. A few examples where this meaning proves very broad include [[artifact]], artificial, artifice, [[artillery]], [[Medicine|medical]] arts, and [[military]] arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology|etymological]] roots.

==Art forms==
There are a variety of arts, including visual arts and design, [[decorative art]]s, [[plastic arts]], and the [[performing arts]]. Artistic expression takes many forms: [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[literature]], and [[architecture]] are the most widely recognised forms. However, since the advent of [[modernism]] and the technological revolution, new forms have emerged. These include [[photography]], [[film]], [[video art]], [[installation art]], [[conceptual art]], [[performance art]], [[community arts]], [[land art]], [[fashion]], [[comics]], [[computer art]], [[anime]], and, most recently, [[video game theory|video games]].

Within each form, a wide range of [[genre]]s may exist. For instance, a painting may be a [[still life]], a [[portrait]], or a [[Landscape art|landscape]] and may deal with [[History painting|historical]] or domestic subjects. In addition, a [[work (fine arts)|work of art]] may be representational or abstract.

Most forms of art fit under two main categories: [[fine arts]] and [[applied art]]s, though there is no clear dividing line. In the visual arts, the term ''fine arts'' most often refers to painting and sculpture, arts which have little or no practical function and are valued in terms of the visual pleasure they provide or their success in communicating ideas or feelings. Other visual arts typically designated as fine arts include printmaking, drawing, photography, film, and video, though the tools used to realize these media are often used to make applied or commercial art as well. Architecture typically confounds the distinctions between fine and applied art, since the form involves designing structures that strive to be both attractive and functional. The term ''applied arts'' is most often used to describe the design or decoration of functional objects to make them visually pleasing. Artists who create applied arts or crafts are usually referred to as [[design]]ers, [[artisan]]s, or craftspeople.

==Defining art==
There is often confusion about the meaning of the term ''art'' because multiple meanings of the word are used interchangeably. Individuals use the word ''art'' to identify painting, as well as singing.

===Characteristics of art===
There follow some generally accepted characteristics of art; after this there is some lengthier discussion of several of those facets perceived as universal or central to art:

* encourages an intuitive understanding rather than a rational understanding, as, for example, with an article in a scientific journal;
* was created with the intention of evoking such an understanding, or an attempt at such an understanding, in the audience;
* was created with no other purpose or function other than to be itself (a radical, &quot;pure art&quot; definition);
* elusive, in that the work may communicate on many different levels of appreciation; one may take the example of [[Gericault]]'s ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]'', in the case of which special knowledge concerning the shipwreck the painting depicts is not a prerequisite to appreciating it, but allows the appreciation of Gericault's political intentions in the piece;
* in relation to the above, the piece may offer itself to many different interpretations, or, though it superficially depicts a mundane event or object, invites reflection upon elevated themes;
* demonstrates a high level of ability or fluency within a medium; this characteristic might be considered a point of contention, since many modern artists (most notably, conceptual artists) do not themselves create the works they conceive, or do not even create the work in a conventional, demonstrative sense (one might think of [[Tracey Emin]]'s controversial ''My Bed'');
* the conferral of a particularly appealing or aesthetically satisfying structure or form upon an original set of unrelated, passive constituents.

===Skill===
Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Recording medium|medium]].  An example of this is the contemporary young master Josignacio, creator of [[Plastic Paint Medium]]. It can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] so as to convey meaning, with immediacy and or depth.

A common view is that the epithet 'art' (particular in its elevated sense) requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability (such as one might find in many works of the [[Rennaissance]] or in the plays of [[Shakespeare]]) or an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two.

For example, a common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art|modern]] painting occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object.  One might take [[Tracey Emin|Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'' or [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'', as examples of pieces wherein the artist exercised little to no traditionally recognised sets of skills. In the first case, Emin simply slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery. She has, however, been insistent that there is a high degree of selection and arrangement in this work, which includes objects such as underwear and bottles around the bed. In the second case, Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork. Although he physically particpated in the creation of this piece, he has left the eventual creation of many other works to employed artisans. These approaches are exemplary of a particular kind of contemporary art: [[conceptual art]].

The exclusionary view that art requires a certain skill level to produce is often described as a [[lay critique]]. It derives from the fact that in [[Western culture]] at least, art has traditionally been pushed in the direction of [[representation (arts)|representationalism]], the literal presentation of reality through literal images.  On the other hand, criticism has often been brought to bear on modern artists for having no creative involvement whatsoever in their creations: one might take Hirst's work again as emblematic of this approach.  It may be further noted that certain forms of art outside a Western tradition, such as [[Islamic]] geometric designs and [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Buddhist]] or [[Hindu]] [[mandalas]] and [[Celtic knotwork]], though they are non-representational, still require a measure of skill and certain creative involvement in their execution.

===Judgments of value===
Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as &quot;that meal was a work of art&quot; (the cook is an artist), or &quot;the art of deception,&quot; (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity.

Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism: at the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'', whether it is perceived to be attractive or repellent. Though perception is always colored by experience, and thus a reaction to art on these grounds is necessarily subjective, it is commonly taken that that which is not aesthetically satisfying in some fashion cannot be art.  However, &quot;good&quot; art is not always, or even regularly, aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic, and art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons; for example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of [[3rd of May]] [[1808]] is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians, yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution, and his fitting social and political outrage.  Thus the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of that which is aesthetically appealing.  Indeed, the reverse is often true, that in the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself.  Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium in order to strike some universal chord, or by the rarity of the skill of the artist, or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''.

===Communicating emotion===
Art appeals to human emotions. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. [[artist|Artists]] have to express themselves so that their public is aroused, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art explores what is commonly termed as ''[[human condition|the human condition]]''; that is, essentially, what it is to be human, and art of a superior kind often brings about some new insight concerning humanity (not always positive) or demonstrates a level of skill so fine as to push forward the boundaries of collective human ability.

This is not to say that technical skill is a necessary prerequisite of art, but rather that a high degree of skill goes some way in conferring a judgement of high standard upon an artist or artwork.

===Creative impulse===
From one [[point of view|perspective]], art is a generic term for any product of the [[creative impulse]], out of which sprang all other human pursuits &amp;mdash; such as [[science]] via [[alchemy]], and [[religion]] via [[shamanism]]. The term 'art' offers no true definition besides those based within the cultural, historical and geographical context in which it is applied. Though to the artists themselves, the impulse to create is undeniable; an artist can no more deny that impulse than he/she could ignore breathing (one might compare [[Kandinsky]]'s [[inner necessity]] to this popular view). It is because of the overbearing need to create, in the face of financial ruin, public obscurity or political opposition, that artists are typically conceived of as unstable, even crazy, or misguided.

==Differences in defining art==
Definitions of art and [[aesthetic]] arguments usually proceed from one of several possible perspectives. Art may be defined by the intention of the artist as in the writings of [[John Dewey|Dewey]]. Art may be seen as being in the response/emotion of the viewer as [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] claims. In [[Arthur Danto|Danto]]'s view, it can be defined as a character of the item itself or as a function of an object's context.

===Plato===
For [[Plato]], art is a pursuit whose adherents are not to be trusted; given that their productions imitate the sensory world (itself an imitation of the divine world of forms) art necessarily is an imitation of an imitation, and thus is hopelessly far from the source of the truth.  Plato, it may be noted, barred artists from access to his ideal city, in his [[Republic]].

===Aristotle===
Aristotle saw art in less of a bad light; though he shared Plato's poor opinion of it, he nevertheless thought that art might serve the purpose of emotional catharsis.  That is, by witnessing the sufferings and celebrations of actors onstage onlookers might vicariously experience these same feelings themselves, and thereby purge such negative feelings.

===Institutional definition===
Many people's opinions of what art is would fall inside a relatively small range of accepted standards, or &quot;institutional definition of art&quot; ([[George Dickie]] 1974). This derives from education and other social factors. Most people did not consider the depiction of a [[Brillo|Brillo Box]] or a store-bought [[urinal]] to be art until [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the [[art gallery]]), which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art (Although, strictly speaking, Warhol's artwork was not an actual Brillo box but an ''exact replica'' of one - so it met the traditional criterion of skill at the very least).

Most viewers of these objects initially rejected such associations, because the objects did not, themselves, meet the accepted criteria. The objects needed to be absorbed into the general consensus of what art is before they achieved the near-universal acceptance as art in the contemporary era. Once accepted and viewed with a fresh eye, the smooth, white surfaces of Duchamp's urinal are strikingly similar to classical marble sculptural forms, whether the artist intended it or not. This type of recontextualizing provides the same spark of connection expected from any traditionally created art.  It should be noted, however, that Duchamps act might be as readily interpreted as a demonstration of the (not always beneficial) power of artistic institutions, rather than the universal art potentially inherent in all objects.

The placement of an object in an artistic context is not taken as a universal standard of art, but is a common characteristic of [[conceptual art]], prevalent since the 1960s; notably, the [[Stuckist]] art movement criticises this tendency of recent art.

==Related issues==
===Social criticism===
Art is often seen as belonging to one social class and excluding others. In this context, art is seen as a high-status activity associated with wealth, the ability to purchase art, and the leisure required to pursue or enjoy it. The [[Palace of Versailles|palaces of Versailles]] or the [[Hermitage]] in [[St. Petersburg]] with their vast collections of art, amassed by the fabulously wealthy royalty of Europe exemplify this view. Collecting such art is the preserve of the rich, in one viewpoint.

Before the [[13th century]] in [[Europe]], artisans were considered to belong to a lower [[caste]], since they were essentially manual labourers. After Europe was re-exposed to [[Renaissance Classicism|classical culture]] during the [[Renaissance]], particularly in the [[nation-state]]s of what is now Italy ([[Florence]], [[Siena]]), artists gained an association with high status. However, arrangements of &quot;fine&quot; and expensive goods have always been used by institutions of power as marks of their own status. This is seen in the 20th and [[21st century]] by the commissioning or purchasing of art by big businesses and corporations as decoration for their offices.

===Utility===
There are many who ascribe to certain arts the quality of being non-[[utilitarianism|utilitarian]]. This fits within the &quot;art as good&quot; system of definitions and suffers from a class prejudice against labor and utility. Opponents of this view argue that all human activity has some utilitarian function, and these objects claimed to be &quot;non-utilitarian&quot; actually have the rather mundane and banal utility of attempting to mystify and codify unworkable justifications for arbitrary social hierarchy.  It might also be argued that non-utilitarian is, in this context, a mis-usage; that art is not in and of itself, useless, but rather that it particularly use does not manifest itself in any traditionally demonstrable way (though advances in neuroscience may arguably enable the isolation of those associated cortices of the brain concerned with the creation or appreciation of art).

Art is also used by art therapists and some psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The end product is not the principal goal in this case; rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought.  The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.

The &quot;use&quot; of art from the artist’s standpoint is as a means of expression. When art is conceived as a device, it serves several context and perspective specific functions. From the artist’s perspective it allows one to symbolize complex ideas and emotions in an arbitrary language subject only to the interpretation of the self and peers.

In a social context, it can serve to soothe the soul and promote popular morale.  In a more negative aspect of this facet, art is often utilised as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood (in some cases, artworks are appropriated to be used in this manner, without the creator's initial intention).

From a more anthropological perspective, art is a way of passing ideas and concepts on to later generations in a (somewhat) universal language. The interpretation of this language is very dependent upon the observer’s perspective and context, and it might be argued that the very subjectivity of art demonstrates its importance in providing an arena in which rival ideas might be exchanged and discussed, or to provide a social context in which disparate groups of people might congregate and mingle.

===History of art===
{{main|History of Art}}

The term '[[art history]]' typically refers to a historical examination of the various trends of the visual arts through certain periods of human history.  It may also be taken to encompass a study of the theories of art, which may or may not include an examination of their historical context.

===Symbols===
{{main|Symbols}}

Much of the development of individual artist deals with finding principles for how to express certain ideas through various kinds of [[symbolism]]. For example, [[Vasily Kandinsky]] developed his use of [[color]] in [[painting]] through a system of stimulus response, where over time he gained an understanding of the [[emotions]] that can be evoked by color and combinations of color. Contemporary artist [[Andy Goldsworthy]], on the other hand, chose to use the [[medium]] of found natural objects and materials to arrange temporary sculptures.

==Cultural differences of art==
Several genres of art are grouped by cultural relevance, examples can be found in terms such as:

*[[African art]]
*[[American craft]]
*[[Islamic art]]
*[[Asian art]] as found in:
**[[Buddhist art]]
**[[Chinese art]]
**[[Art and architecture of Japan|Japanese art]]
**[[Tibetan art]]
**[[Thai art]]
**[[Laotian art]]
*[[Visual arts of the United States]]
*[[Latin American art]]

[[Image:ActorsOffSetLaughing.jpg|thumb|right|Actors in period costume sharing a joke whilst waiting between takes during location filming.]]
An '''actor''' is a person who [[acting|acts]], or plays a role, in an artistic production. The term commonly refers to someone working in [[film|movies]], [[television]], live [[Theater|theatre]], or [[radio programming|radio]], and can occasionally denote a street entertainer. Besides playing dramatic roles, actors may also sing or dance or work only on radio or as a [[voice artist]]. A [[female]] actor may be known as an '''actress''', although the term &quot;actor&quot;, is also used as a gender-neutral term.

An actor usually plays a [[fictional character]]. In the case of a true story (or a fictional story that portrays real people) an actor may play a real person (or a fictional version of the same).  Occasionally, actors appear as themselves.
==Etymology==
&quot;Actor&quot; is directly from the masculine [[Latin]] noun ''actor'' (feminine, ''actrix'') from the [[Latin verbs|verb]] ''agere'' &quot;'''to do''', to drive, to pass time&quot; + the suffix ''-or'' &quot;so./st. who performs the action indicated by the stem&quot;. Alternatively from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|ἂκτωρ}} ''(aktor)'', leader, from the [[verb]] {{polytonic|ἂγω}} ''(agō)'', to lead or carry, to convey, to bring.

==History==
The first recorded case of an actor performing took place in [[530s BC|534 BC]] (probably on [[23 November]], though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the [[Greece|Greek]] performer [[Thespis]] stepped on to the stage at the ''Theatre Dionysus'' and became the first person to speak words as a character in a play. The machinations of storytelling were immediately revolutionized. Prior to Thespis' act, stories were told in [[song]] and dance and in [[Perspective (storytelling)|third person]] narrative, but no one had assumed the role of a character in a story. In honour of Thespis, actors are commonly called ''Thespians''. Theatrical [[Mythology|myth]] to this day maintains that Thespis exists as a mischievous spirit, and disasters in the theatre are sometimes blamed on his ghostly intervention.

Actors were traditionally not people of high status, and in the [[Early Middle Ages]] travelling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. However, this negative perception dramaticaly changed in 20th Century as acting became an honored and popular profession and art. Part of the reason is due to the rise of the popular appeal and access to dramatic [[film]] entertainment and the resulting rise of the [[movie star]] in social status and the large salaries they commanded.  The combination of public presence and wealth had a profound rehabilitation to the image.

In the past, only men could become actors.  In the ancient and [[middle ages|medieval world]], it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on the stage, and this belief continued right up until the 17th century, when in [[Venice]] it was broken.  In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], women's roles were played by men or boys, though there is some evidence to suggest that women disguised as men also (illegally) performed.

==Actors playing the opposite sex==
Women sometimes play the roles of [[prepubescent]] boys, because in some regards a woman has a closer resemblance to a boy than does a man. The role of [[Peter Pan]], for example, is traditionally played by a woman. The tradition of the [[principal boy]] in [[pantomime]] may be compared. An adult playing a child occurs more in theater than in film. The exception to this is voice actors in [[animated]] films, where boys are generally voiced by women, as heard in ''[[The Simpsons]]''.  [[Opera]] has several '[[pants role]]s' traditionally sung by women, usually [[mezzo-soprano]]s.  Examples are Hansel in ''[[Hänsel und Gretel]]'', and [[The Marriage of Figaro#Characters|Cherubino]] in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.

[[Mary Pickford]] played the part of [[Little Lord Fauntleroy]] in the first film version of the book. [[Linda Hunt]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously]]'', in which she played the part of a man.  

Having an actor play the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long standing tradition in comic theatre and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of cross dressing, and both [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Robin Williams]] appeared in hit comedy films where they were required to play most scenes dressed as women. [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.

==Techniques of acting==
Actors employ a variety of techniques that are learned through training and experience. Some of these are:

#The rigorous use of the voice to communicate a character's lines and express emotion. This is achieved through attention to diction and projection through correct breathing and articulation. It is also achieved through the tone and emphasis that an actor puts on words
#Physicalisation of a role in order to create a believable character for the audience and to use the acting space appropriately and correctly
#Use of gesture to complement the voice, interact with other actors and to bring emphasis to the words in a play, as well as having symbolic meaning

[[Shakespeare]] is believed to have been commenting on the acting style and techniques of his era when [[Hamlet]] gives his famous advice to the players:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance: o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
