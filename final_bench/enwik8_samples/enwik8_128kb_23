nd reverted to his previous criminality. But on this particular night he decides not to join them and goes for a walk on his own instead. In a cafe he bumps into one of his old gang member Pete, who is married and has become a respectable member of society. Pete's wife giggles at Alex's rhetoric, and asks Pete &quot;why does he speak like that?&quot; After conversing with Pete and his wife, Alex has an epiphany, renouncing violence on one hand, but on the other concluding that his behaviour was an unavoidable part of youth, and that if he had a son, he would not be able to stop him from doing what he did.

Although the book is divided into three parts, each containing seven chapters, twenty-one being a symbolic number as it was the age that which a child earns his rights at the time, the 21st chapter was omitted from the versions published in the US. The [[Film|film]] adaptation which was directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]] follows the American version of the book, ending prior the events of the 21st chapter.  Kubrick claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, but that he certainly never gave any serious consideration to using it.

==Analysis== 
The book, narrated by Alex, contains many words in a slang dialect which Burgess invented for the book, called [[nadsat]]. It is a mix of modified [[Russian_language|Russian]] words, [[English_language|English]] slang and words invented by Burgess himself. It serves two functions, firstly Burgess, while wanting to provide his young characters with their own register did not want to use contemporary slang, fearing that this would &quot;date&quot; the book too much. Secondly, the novel graphically describes horrific scenes of violence, which would be shocking even by today's standards, so nadsat is used as a &quot;linguistic veil&quot; to distance the reader from the action on the page.

==Influence==
{{main|List of cultural references to A Clockwork Orange}}
Both the story and individual elements have had a strong influence on [[popular culture]] in general and [[popular music]] in particular.

==Trivia==
* Alex's age at the end of the novel is the same age that the Burgesses' miscarried child would have been at the date of publication, had the child survived the attack on Lynne, been born and grown up.
* The allegedly Cockney phrase ''A Clockwork Orange'' is totally unknown to history: the first recorded use of it is Burgess's title. Quoted in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article, Burgess claimed to have first heard the expression &quot;from a very old Cockney in 1945.&quot;
*Burgess claimed that he had typed the title ''A Clockwork Orange'' and then sat down to think of a story to go with it. One early idea apparently involved a strike or riot among apprentices under Elizabeth I.
*As with many writers and their most popular books, this was one of Burgess's least favourite of the books he wrote, and he thought it was overrated.
*Since, in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' the author F. Alexander wrote a book entitled ''A Clockwork Orange'' and it is his wife who is attacked by the droogs, it seems likely Burgess directly inserted some of his own feelings and characteristics into the novel in the form of this character.

'''Amsterdam''', ({{Pronunciation|Nl-Amsterdam.ogg}}) the [[capital]] of the [[Netherlands]], lies on the banks of two bodies of water, the [[IJ (bay)|IJ bay]] and the [[Amstel]] river. Founded in the late [[12th century]] as a small fishing village on the banks of the [[Amstel]],  it is now the largest city in the country and its financial and cultural centre. As of 2005, the population of the city proper is 742,951{{ref|population}}; the population of the greater Amsterdam area is approximately one and a half million.

Amsterdam has one of the largest historic city centres in Europe, dating largely from the 17th century, the Golden Age of the Netherlands, of which it was the focal point. At this time, a series of concentric, semi-circular canals were built around the older city centre, which still defines its layout and appearance today. Many fine houses and mansions are situated along the canals; most are lived in, others are now offices, and some are public buildings.  Some of the narrow brick houses are gradually sinking because they are built on [[pile|piles]] to cope with the marshy subsoil.

The city is noted for many outstanding museums, including the [[Rijksmuseum]], the [[Van Gogh Museum]], the [[Stedelijk Museum]], [[Rembrandt House Museum]], the [[Anne Frank House]], and its world-class symphony orchestra, the [[Concertgebouworkest]], whose home base is the [[Concertgebouw]]. Notable are also its [[red-light district]], ''[[de Wallen]]'', and its numerous &quot;[[coffee shop]]s&quot; selling [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].

Although Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands, it is neither the capital of the province in which it is located, [[North Holland]] (which is [[Haarlem]]), nor the seat of government (which is [[The Hague]]).

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Amsterdam]]''

[[Image:Amsterdam airphoto.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Historical centre]]
Amsterdam was founded as a fishing village in the [[13th century]]. According to legend Amsterdam was founded by two [[Frisian]] fishermen, who landed on the shores of the Amstel in a small boat with their dog. The damming of the river [[Amstel]] gave it its name.  It was given [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in [[1300]] or [[1301]].  From the [[14th century]] on, Amsterdam flourished, largely on the basis of trade with the cities of the [[Hanseatic League]].

The [[16th century]] brought a rebellion by the Dutch against [[Philip II of Spain]] and his successors, escalating into the [[Eighty Years' War]] which ultimately led to Dutch independence. The Dutch Republic became known for its relative religious tolerance and [[Jew]]s from [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], prosperous merchants from [[Antwerp]] (economic and religious refugees from the part of the Low Countries still controlled by Spain), [[Huguenots]] from [[France]] (persecuted for their religion) sought safety in Amsterdam. It was the rich, refined migrants from Flanders who set the tone (their Brabant dialects became the basis of standard written Dutch) and made Holland a [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] power.

[[Image:AmsterdamDamsquar.jpg|thumb|left|Dam Square in the late 17th century: painting by Jan Adriaensz. Berckheyde (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden)]]
The [[17th century]] is considered Amsterdam's &quot;Golden Age&quot;.  In the early 17th century Amsterdam was the richest city in Europe. Ships sailed from Amsterdam to [[North America]], [[Africa]] and present-day [[Indonesia]] and [[Brazil]] and formed the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the biggest share in the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]. These companies acquired the overseas possessions which formed the seeds of the later Dutch colonies. Amsterdam was the most important point for the trans-shipment of goods in Europe and it was the leading financial centre of the world. Amsterdam's stock exchange was the first to trade continuously. 

The population grew from slightly over 10,000 around 1500 to 30,000 around 1570, 60,000 around 1600, 105,000 in 1622 and almost 200,000 around 1700 (a twenty fold increase in 200 years). Thereafter, the population did not change much for another century and a half. During the century before World War II it almost quadrupled to 800,000, but then remained fairly constant again to this day.

[[Image:River Amstel by Night - Frans Koppelaar.jpg|thumb|200px|River Amstel by Night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Painting by [[Frans Koppelaar|Koppelaar]]&lt;/small&gt;]]The 18th and early 19th centuries saw a decline in Amsterdam's prosperity. The wars of the Dutch Republic with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] took their toll on Amsterdam. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] Amsterdam's fortunes reached their lowest point. However, with the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in [[1815]], things slowly began to improve. In Amsterdam new developments were started by people like [[Sarphati]] who found their inspiration in Paris.

The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam's second Golden Age. New museums, a train station, and the Concertgebouw were built. At this time the [[Industrial Revolution]] reached Amsterdam. The ''[[Amsterdam-Rhine Canal]]'' was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the [[Rhine]] and the ''[[North Sea Canal]]'' to give the port a shorter connection to the [[North Sea]]. Both projects improved communication with the rest of Europe and the world dramatically.

[[Image:annefrankmuseum.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;font size='1'&gt;In 2004, 936,432 people visited the museum adjoining #263 Prinsengracht, better known as the Anne Frank House.&lt;/font&gt;]]
Shortly before the [[First World War]] the city began expanding and new suburbs were built. During [[World War I]], the Netherlands remained neutral. Amsterdam suffered a food shortage and heating fuel became scarce.  The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed.

Germany invaded the Netherlands in [[10 May]] [[1940]], taking control of the country after five days of fighting. The Germans installed a Nazi civilian government in Amsterdam that cooperated in the persecution of Jews.  More than 80,000 [[Jew]]s were deported to concentration camps, of whom perhaps the most famous was a young German girl, [[Anne Frank]]. Only 5,000 Jews survived the war. In the last months of the war communication with the rest of the country broke down and food and fuel became scarce. Many inhabitants of the city had to travel to the countryside to collect food. Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel.

==Coat of arms==
[[Image:Wapen amsterdam.jpg|frame|left]]
The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of three [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]]'s crosses, aligned vertically, but rotated 90 degrees for the flag. Historians believe they represent the three dangers which have traditionally plagued the city: flood, fire, and pestilence. The city's official motto, ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' (&quot;Valiant, Resolute, Merciful&quot;) which is displayed on the coat of arms, was bestowed on it by [[Queen Wilhelmina]] in 1947 in recognition of the city's bravery during World War II. The lions were added in the sixteenth century.

The crown was awarded to the city in 1489 by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], out of gratitude for services and loans. The crown was a sign of imperial protection and acted as a seal of approval for Amsterdam merchants abroad. The Westertoren also features the imperial crown.

==City government==
''Main article: [[Amsterdam (municipality)]]''

[[Image:Amsterdam 4.89943E 52.37109N.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Satellite image of Amsterdam]]

As all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a mayor, his ''wethouders'' (aldermen), and the municipal council. However, unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into fifteen ''stadsdelen'' (boroughs), a system that was implemented in the 1980s to improve local governance. The ''stadsdelen'' are responsible for many activities that previously had been run by the central city. Fourteen of these have their own council, chosen by a popular election. The fifteenth, Westerpoort, covers the harbour of Amsterdam, has very few inhabitants, and is governed by the central municipal council. Local decisions are made at borough level, and only affairs pertaining to the whole city, such as major infrastructure projects, are handled by the central city council.

==Academia==
Amsterdam has two universities: the [[University of Amsterdam]] (Universiteit van Amsterdam), and the [[Vrije Universiteit]]. Other institutions for higher education include an art school, De Rietveldacademie, the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, the Hogeschool voor Economische Studies Amsterdam and the Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten, which includes the Sweelinck Conservatorium. Amsterdam's [[International Institute of Social History]] is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning social history, and especially the history of the labour movement. Amsterdam's [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]], founded in the early 1600s, is one of the oldest [[botanical garden]]s in the world, with many old and rare specimens, amongst which the coffee plant that served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in Central and South America.

[[Image:Java_Island_Architecture.jpg|thumb|Java Island, in [[IJ (bay)|'t IJ]], is known for its modern architecture.]]

==Public transport==
Public transport in Amsterdam, operated by [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf]], [[Connexxion]], and [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]], consists of: 

* national and international [[train]] connections
* 3 [[metro]] lines and 1 [[light rail]] line, together the [[Amsterdam metro]]
* 16 [[tram]] lines
* An express tram line (IJtram)
* 55 local bus lines
* regional bus lines
* several [[ferries]] for pedestrians and cyclists across the [[IJ (bay)|IJ]] (free of charge)
* a Fast Flying Ferry towards [[Velsen]]-Zuid on the North Sea shore

A new underground line, the [[North/South Line]] (''Noord/Zuidlijn'') is under construction. (See also [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf]], [[Amsterdam metro]], [[Amsterdam Centraal]]).

===History===
During the construction of the [[Amsterdam metro]], plans to demolish the entire [[Jew]]ish neighbourhood near the [[Nieuwmarkt]] led to strong protests. The metro was still built (wall decorations at the [[Nieuwmarkt]] station are dedicated to the protests), but plans to build a highway through the neighbourhood in the centre of Amsterdam were abolished. In 1975 there was an incident where a planned bombing of the Venserpolder station led to a political scandal when mayor Ivo Samkalden and everyone in the city council, except for [[Roel van Duijn]], instantly and erroneously blamed the left-wing protesters, which was exactly the objective of the right-wing bombers.

[[Image:Amster.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the ubiquitous cyclists in Amsterdam]]

==Private transport==
Many people in Amsterdam use [[bicycle|bicycles]] to get around.  Most main streets have bike paths. Bike racks are ubiquitous throughout the city. In the city centre, driving a car is complicated by traffic jams and limited and expensive parking space.

==Airport==
[[Schiphol Airport|Schiphol]], about twenty minutes by train from downtown Amsterdam, is the biggest airport in the Netherlands, and the fourth largest in Europe. It handles about 42 million passengers a year and is home base to [[KLM]].

==Sports==
Amsterdam is the home town of [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]], a team in the [[Dutch Football League]]. Its home base is the modern stadium [[Amsterdam ArenA]], located in the south-east of the city. The team shares that facility with the [[Amsterdam Admirals]], an [[American football]] team.

In 1928, Amsterdam hosted the [[1928 Summer Olympics|Games of the IXth Olympiad]]. The [[Olympisch Stadion (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]] built for the occasion has been completely restored and is now used for cultural and sporting events.

Amsterdam also is home to a famous [[ice rink]], the [[Jaap Eden]] baan. The [[Amstel Tijgers]] play in this arena in the Dutch [[ice hockey]] premier league. In [[speed skating]] many international championships have been fought in the 400-meter lane of this ice rink.

The city also has a [[baseball]] team, the [[Amsterdam pirates]] who play in the Dutch Major League. Three [[field hockey]] teams, Amsterdam, Pinoké and Hurley, and a [[basketball]] team, the [[Amsterdam Astronauts]] who play in the Dutch premier division and play their games in the Sporthallen Zuid, near the Olympic Stadium.

==Periodic events==
* [[Koninginnedag]], ''Queen's day'', [[30 April]], the former [[Queen_of_the_Netherlands|Queen's]] ([[Juliana_of_the_Netherlands|Juliana]]) birthday
* [[Uitmarkt]], last weekend in August, the start of the cultural season
* ''Amsterdam Roots'', last week of June. International music festival
* ''Amsterdam Pride'', mid-August, [[gay pride]] weekend
* ''Amsterdam Marathon'', mid-October
* [[Sail Amsterdam]], a five-yearly event, when [[tall ship]]s from all over the world can be visited.

[[Image:Automobiles.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A small variety of cars, the most popular kind of automobile.]]

An '''automobile'''  is a [[wheel]]ed [[vehicle]] that carries its own [[motor]]. Different types of automobiles include cars, [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[van]]s, and [[motorcycles]], with cars being the most popular. The term is derived from Greek 'autos' (''self'') and Latin 'movére' (''move''), referring to the fact that it 'moves by itself'. Earlier terms for automobile include '[[Brass Era car|horseless carriage]]' and 'motor car'. An automobile has seats for the [[driving|driver]] and, almost without exception, one or more passengers. It is the main source of [[transportation]] across the world.

[[As of 2005]] there are 500 million cars worldwide (0.074 per capita), of which 220 million are located in the [[United States]] (0.75 per capita).

==History==
{{main|History of the automobile}}

===The history of automobiles=== The modern automobile powered by the Otto gasoline engine was invented in Germany by [[Karl Benz]]. Even though Karl Benz is credited with the invention of the modern automobile, several other German engineers worked on building the first automobile at the same time. These inventors are: [[Karl Benz]] on [[July 3]], [[1886]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in [[Stuttgart]] (also inventors of the first motor bike) and in 1888/89 [[Germany|German]]-[[Austrian]] inventor [[Siegfried Marcus]] in [[Vienna]], although Marcus didn't go beyond the prototype stage.
{{Automobile history eras}}

==='''Steam powered vehicles'''===
[[Steam-power]]ed self-propelled cars were devised in the late [[18th century]]. The first self-propelled car was built by [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] in [[1769]], it could attain speeds of up to 6 km/h. In [[1771]] he designed another steam-driven car, which ran so fast that it rammed into a wall, producing the world’s first [[car accident]].

===The Internal Combustion Engine===
In 1806 [[Fransois Isaac de Rivaz]], a Swiss, designed the first [[internal combustion engine]] (sometimes abbreviated &quot;ICE&quot; today). He subsequently used it to develop the world’s first vehicle to run on such an engine, one that used a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to generate [[energy]]. It was not very successful, as was the case with the British inventor, Brown, and the American inventor, Morey, who produced clumsy IC-engine-powered vehicles about 1826.

Etienne Lenoir produced the first successful internal-combustion engine in 1860, and within a few years, about 400 were in operation in Paris.  In about 1863, Lenoir installed his engine in a vehicle.  It seems to have been powered by city lighting-gas in bottles, and was said by Lenoir to have &quot;travelled slower than a man could walk, with breakdowns being frequent.&quot;  Lenoir, in his patent of 1860, included the provision of a carburettor, so liquid fuel could be substituted for gas, particularly for mobile purposes, i.e., vehicles.  Lenoir is said to have tested liquid fuel, such as alcohol, in his stationary engines; but it doesn't appear he used them in his vehicle.  If he did, he most certainly didn't use gasoline, as this was not well-known and was considered a waste product.

The next innovation comes in the late 1860s, with [[Siegfried Marcus]], a German working in Vienna, Austria.  He developed the idea of using gasoline as a fuel in a two-stroke internal-combustion engine.  In 1870, he built a crude vehicle, with no seats, steering or brakes, but it was spectacular for one reason:  it was the world's first internal-combustion-engine-powered vehicle fueled by gasoline.  It was tested in Vienna in September of 1870.  In 1888/1889, he built a second car, this one with seats, brakes and steering, and a four-stroke engine of his own design.  

The four-stroke engine had already been written down and patented in 1862 by the Frenchman Beau de Rochas in a long-winded and rambling pamphlet.  He printed about 300 copies of his pamphlet and they were distributed in Paris, but nothing came of this, with the patent expiring soon after and the pamphlet disappearing into total obscurity.  In fact, hardly anyone knew of it to begin with.  Beau de Rochas never built a single engine.  

Most historians agree that Nikolaus Otto of Germany built the world's first four-stroke engine.  He knew nothing of Beau de Rochas's patent or idea, and came upon the idea entirely on his own; in fact, he began thinking about it in 1861, but abandoned the idea until the mid-1870's. There is some evidence, although not conclusive, that one Christian Reithmann, an Austrian living in Germany, had built a four-stroke engine entirely on his own by 1873.  Reithmann had been experimenting with IC-engines as early as 1852.

In 1883, Edouard Delamare-Deboutteville and Leon Malandin of France installed an internal-combustion engine powered by a tank of city gas on a tricycle.  As they tested the vehicle, the tank hose came loose, resulting in an explosion.  In 1884, Delamare-Deboutteville and Malandin built and patented a second vehicle.  This one consisted of two four-stroke, liquid-fueled engines mounted to an old four-wheeled horse cart.  The patent, and presumably the vehicle, contained many innovations, some of which wouldn't be used for decades.  However, during the vehicle's first test, the frame broke apart, the vehicle literally &quot;shaking itself to pieces,&quot; in Malandin's own words.  No more vehicles were built by the two men, and their venture went completely unnoticed and their patent unexploited. No one else knew of the vehicles and experiments until years later.  

Supposedly in the late 1870's, an Italian named Murnigotti patented the idea of installing an IC engine on a vehicle, although there is no evidence one was built.  In 1884, Enrico Bernardi, another Italian, installed an IC engine on his son's tricycle.  Although nothing more than a toy, it is said to have operated somewhat successfully in one source, but another says the engine's power was too feeble to make the vehicle move.

But if all of the above experiments hadn't taken place, the development of the automobile wouldn't have been retarded by so much as a moment, since they were unknown experiments that went no further than the testing stage.  The internal-combustion-engined car really can be said to have begun with Benz and Daimler in 1886, for their vehicles were successful, they went into series-production, and they inspired others.

Benz, after building his first three-wheeled car in 1885, built improved versions in 1886 and 1887, and went into production in 1888 -- the world's first vehicle to do so.  Approximately 25 were built until 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced. They were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products.  Because France was more open to the automobile in general, more were built and sold in France than by Benz himself in Germany. 

Daimler built a car in 1886 - a new horse carriage fitted with his new high-speed 4-stroke engine.  In 1889, he built two vehicles from scratch, with several innovations.  From about 1890-1895 about 30 vehicles were built by Daimler and his innovative assistant, Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after having a falling out with their backers.

In 1890, Emile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began series-producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the motor industry in France. They were inspired by Daimler's Stalhradwagen of 1889, which was exhibited in Paris in 1889. 

The first American automobile with gasoline-powered [[internal combustion engine]]s was supposedly designed in 1877 by [[George Baldwin Selden]] of [[Rochester, New York]], who applied for a patent on the automobile in 1879.  Selden didn't build a single car until 1905, when he was forced to do so due to the lawsuit.  Selden received his patent and later sued the Ford Motor Company for infringing his patent.  Henry Ford was notoriously against the American patent system, and Selden's case against Ford went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], who ruled that Ford and everyone else was free to build automobiles without paying royalties to Selden, since automobile technology had improved since Selden's patent, and no one was building those antiquated designs.


Meanwhile, notable advances in steam power evolved in [[Birmingham]], England by the [[Lunar Society]]. It was here that the term [[horsepower]] was first used. It was in Birmingham also that the first British four wheel [[petrol]]-driven automobiles were built in 1895 by [[Frederick William Lanchester]] who also patented the [[disc brake]] in the city. [[Electric vehicle]]s were produced by a small number of manufacturers.

===Innovation===
[[Image:Olds2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ransom E. Olds, the creator of the Assembly line]]
The first automobile [[patent]] in the [[United States]] was granted to [[Oliver Evans]] in 1789; in 1804 Evans demonstrated his first successful self-propelled vehicle, which not only was the first automobile in the US but was also the first [[amphibious vehicle]], as his steam-powered vehicle was able to travel on [[wheel]]s on land and via a [[paddle wheel]] in the water.

On [[5 November]], [[1895]], [[George B. Selden]] was granted a United States patent for a [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] automobile engine ({{US patent|549160}}). This patent did more to hinder than encourage development of autos in the USA. A major breakthrough came with the historic drive of [[Bertha Benz]] in 1888. Steam, electric, and gasoline powered autos competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s.

[[Image:Bentley Continental GT dashboard.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The interior of a modern luxury car, a [[Bentley Continental GT]]]]

The large scale, [[production-line]] manufacturing of affordable automobiles was debuted by [[Oldsmobile]] in 1902, then greatly expanded by [[Henry Ford]] in the 1910s. Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric [[ignition system|ignition]] and the electric self-starter (both by [[Charles Kettering]], for the [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]] Motor Company in 1910-1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.

===Model changeover and design change===

[[Image:2000 Ford Taurus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Ford Taurus]], a modern family car which has gone through a number of changes.]]
Cars are not merely continually perfected mechanical contrivances; since the 1920s nearly all have been mass-produced to meet a market, so marketing plans and manufacture to meet them have often dominated automobile design. It was [[Alfred P. Sloan]] who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one firm, so that buyers could &quot;move up&quot; as their fortunes improved. The makes shared parts with one another so that the larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1950s, [[Chevrolet]] shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with [[Pontiac]]; the LaSalle of the 1930s, sold by [[Cadillac]], used the cheaper mechanical parts made by the Oldsmobile division.

==Alternative fuels and batteries==
{{main|Alternative fuel cars}}
With heavy [[tax]]es on fuel, particularly in [[Europe]] and tightening environmental [[law]]s, particularly in [[California]], and the possibility of further restrictions on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, work on alternative power systems for vehicles continues.

[[Diesel]]-powered cars can run with little or no modification on 100% pure [[biodiesel]], a fuel that can be made from [[vegetable oil]]s. Many cars that currently use gasoline can run on ethanol, a fuel made from plant sugars. Most cars that are designed to run on gasoline are capable of running with 15% ethanol mixed in, and with a small amount of redesign, gasoline-powered vehicles can run on ethanol concentrations as high as 85%. All petrol fuelled cars can run on [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]]. There has been some concern that the ethanol-gasoline mixtures prematurely wear down seals and gaskets.  Further, the use of higher levels of alcohol requires that the automobile carry/use twice as much.  Therefore, if your vehicle is capable of 300 miles on a 15-gallon tank, the efficiency is reduced to approximately 150 miles.  Of course, certain measures are available to increase this efficiency, such as different camshaft configurations, altering the timing/spark output of the ignition, or simply, using a larger fuel tank.

In the [[United States]], alcohol fuel was produced in corn-alcohol [[still]]s until [[Prohibition]] criminalized the production of alcohol in 1919. [[Brazil]] is the only country which produces ethanol-running cars, since the late 1970s.

Attempts at building viable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered electric vehicles continued throughout the 1990s (notably [[General Motors]] with the [[EV1]]), but cost, speed and inadequate driving range made them uneconomical.  Battery powered cars have used [[lead-acid batteries]] which are greatly damaged in their recharge capacity if discharged beyond 75% on a regular basis and [[Nickel metal hydride|NiMH batteries]].

Current research and development is centered on &quot;[[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]]&quot; vehicles that use both electric power and internal combustion.  The first hybrid vehicle available for sale in the USA was the [[Honda Insight]].  As of 2005, The car is still in production and achieves around 60 mpg.

Other R&amp;D efforts in alternative forms of power focus on developing [[fuel cells]], alternative forms of combustion such as [[Gasoline Direct Injection|GDI]] and [[HCCI]], and even the stored energy of compressed air (see [[water Engine]]).

==Safety==
[[Image:Eurocar.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Mini]] in Paris, France]]
Automobiles were a significant improvement in safety on a per passenger mile basis, over the horse based travel that they replaced. Millions have been able to reach medical care much more quickly when transported by [[ambulance]].

[[Car accident|Accidents]] seem as old as automobile vehicles themselves. [[Joseph Cugnot]] crashed his steam-powered &quot;Fardier&quot; against a wall in 1770. The first recorded automobile fatality was [[Bridget Driscoll]] on [[1896-08-17]] in [[London]] and the first in the [[United States]] was [[Henry Bliss]] on [[1899-09-13]] in [[New York City, NY]].

Cars have two basic safety problems: They have human drivers who make mistakes, and the wheels lose traction near a half gravity of deceleration. [[Automated highway system|Automated control]] has been seriously proposed and successfully prototyped. Shoulder-belted passengers could tolerate a 32[[Gee|G]] emergency stop (reducing the safe intervehicle gap 64-fold) if high-speed roads incorporated a steel rail for emergency braking. Both safety modifications of the roadway are thought to be too expensive by most funding authorities, although these modifications could dramatically increase the number of vehicles that could safely use a high-speed highway.

Early safety research focused on increasing the reliability of brakes and reducing the flammability of fuel systems. For example, modern engine compartments are open at the bottom so that fuel vapors, which are heavier than air, vent to the open air. Brakes are hydraulic so that failures are slow leaks, rather than abrupt cable breaks. Systematic research on crash safety started in 1958 at [[Ford Motor Company]]. Since then, most research has focused on absorbing external crash energy with crushable panels and reducing the motion of human bodies in the passenger compartment.

There are standard tests for safety in new automobiles, like the [[EuroNCAP]] and the [http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/testing/ncap/ US NCAP] tests. There are also tests run by organizations such as [http://www.hwysafety.org/ IIHS] and backed by the insurance industry.

Despite technological advances, there is still significant loss of life from car accidents: About 40,000 people die every year in the [[U.S.]], with similar figures in [[Europe]]. This figure increases annually in step with rising population and increasing travel if no measures are taken, but the rate [[per capita]] and per mile travelled decreases steadily. The death toll is expected to nearly double worldwide by 2020. A much higher number of accidents result in injury or permanent [[disability]]. The highest accident figures are reported in China and India. The European Union has a rigid program to cut the death toll in the EU in half by 2010 and member states have started implementing measures.

==Current Production==
In 2005 63 million cars and light trucks were produced worldwide. The world's biggest car producer (including light trucks) is the European Union with 29% of the world's production. In non-EU Eastern Europe another 4% are produced. The second largest manufacturer is NAFTA with 25.8%, followed by Japan with 16.7%, China with 8.1%, MERCOSUR with 3.9%, India with 2.4% and the rest of the world with 10.1%. (vda-link)

Large free trade areas like EU, NAFTA and MERCOSUR attract manufacturers worldwide to produce their products within them and without currency risks or customs, additionally to being close to customers. Thus the production figures do not show the technological ability or business skill of the areas. In fact much if not most of the Third World car production is used western technology and car models (and sometimes even complete obsolete western factories shipped to the country), which is reflected in the patent statistic as well as the locations of the r&amp;d centers.

The automobile industry is dominated by relatively few large corporations (not to be confused with the much more numerous brands), the biggest of which (by numbers of produced cars) are currently [[General Motors]], [[Toyota]] and [[Ford Motor Company]]. It is expected, that Toyota will reach the No.1 position in 2006. The most profitable per-unit carmaker of recent years has been Porsche due to their premium price tag.

The automotive industry at large still suffers from high under-utilization of its manufacturing potential.

==Future of the car==
In order to limit deaths, there has been a push for self-driving automobiles.  Much of the drive for computer-driven vehicles has been led by [[DARPA]] with their [http://www.grandchallenge.org/ Grand Challenge] race.

A current and powerful invention was ESP by Bosch and many followers that reduces deaths by about 30% and is recommended by many lawmakers and carmakers to be a standard feature in all cars sold in the EU. ESP recognizes dangerous situations and corrects the drivers input for a short moment to stabilize the car. 

The biggest threat to automobiles is the declining supply of oil, which does not completely stop car usage but makes it significantly more expensive. Beginning of 2006 a gallon of gas costs approx. 6 US$ in Germany and other European countries. If no cheap solution can be found in the relatively near future individual mobility might suffer a major setback. Nevertheless, individual mobility is highly prized in modern societies so the demand for automobiles will remain just with a different power source.

Looking at automotive technology some areas appear to have the most need of development. For example, both the rubber tires and the batteries currently used by most cars seem rather antiquated when compared to,say, modern-day engines and traction-control systems. These are like jets with cardboard wings or PCs with 10 KB hard drives respectively. While slow moving cars can control their wheels via ESP reasonably well, fast moving vehicles like a Bugatti Veyron need a special tire checkup before approaching 400 km/h. Also the existing batteries are barely fit to handle the cars electronics but are far off from the ability to store enough energy for moving the car unassisted.

'''Audi''' is an [[automobile]] maker in [[Germany]], and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the [[Volkswagen Group]]. The company is headquartered in [[Ingolstadt]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

Audi's German [[tagline]] is &quot;[[Vorsprung durch Technik]]&quot;. The [[tagline]] is used either in original or in its English translation &quot;Progress through Technology&quot;.

==History==
[[Image:Audi NSU range (1969).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Press photograph of the then newly merged Audi NSU range, 1969.]]
===The origins of Audi===
The company traces its origins back to 1899 and [[August Horch]]. The first Horch automobile was produced in 1901 in [[Zwickau]], in former [[East Germany]]. In 1910, Horch was forced out of the company he had founded. He then started a new company in Zwickau and continued using the Horch brand. His former partners sued him for [[trademark]] infringement and a German court determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company. August Horch was forced to refrain from using his own [[family name]] in his new car business. As the word &quot;horch!&quot; translates to &quot;listen!&quot; in [[German language|German]], August Horch settled on the [[Latin]] equivalent of his name - &quot;audi!&quot;. It is also popularly believed that Audi is an acronym which stands for &quot;Auto Union [[Germany|Deutschland]] [[Ingolstadt]]&quot;. Audi produces over 2 million vehicles annually at its main production site in [[Ingolstadt]]. Audi has another production plant in Neckarsulm.

Audi started with a 2612 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] model followed by a four cylinder model with 3564 cc, as well as 4680 cc and 5720 cc models. These cars were successful even in sporting events. August Horch left the Audi company in 1920. The first six cylinder model (4655 cc) appeared in 1924. In 1928, the company was acquired by [[J S Rasmussen]], owner of [[DKW]], who bought the same year the remains of the US [[automobile manufacturer]], [[Rickenbacker]] including the manufacturing equipment for eight cylinder engines. These engines were used in ''Audi Zwickau'' and ''Audi Dresden'' models that were launched in 1929. At the same time, six cylinder and a small four cylinder (licensed from [[Peugeot]]) models were manufactured. Audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork.

===The Auto Union era===
In 1932 Audi merged with [[Horch]], [[DKW]] and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] to form the [[Auto Union]].
Before [[World War II]], Auto Union used the four interlinked rings that make up the Audi badge today, representing these four brands. This badge was used, however, only on Auto Union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems. The technological development became more and more concentrated and some Audi models were propelled by Horch or Wanderer built engines.

===Pause and a new start===
Auto Union plants were heavily bombed and partly destroyed during [[World War II]]. After the war, Zwickau soon became part of the [[German Democratic Republic]] and Audi headquarters were moved to [[Ingolstadt]]. In that period, the four interlinked rings were used together with the DKW badge. The company focused efforts on the DKW brand, but their [[two-stroke]] engines became unpopular. In 1958, [[Daimler-Benz]] acquired 88 per cent of Auto Union and the next year became its sole owner. Daimler-Benz developed a 72 hp (54 kW) four-door sedan, with a modern [[four stroke engine]] driving the front wheels. This model appeared in September 1965, &quot;relaunching&quot; the Audi brand. Daimler-Benz sold the company to [[Volkswagen]] in 1964; subsequently, Volkswagen's purchase of Auto Union has led to the modernization of VW to which it gained expertise in manufacturing water-cooled vehicles.  Today, aircooled powerplants once produced by VW are no longer placed into production vehicles since December 23, 2005.  
[[image:Audi_60.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Audi 60 (1968 - 1972)]]
In 1969, Audi merged with [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]], based in [[Neckarsulm]] near [[Stuttgart]]. In the [[1950s]] NSU had been the world's largest manufacturer of [[motorcycle]]s but had moved on to produce small cars like the [[NSU Prinz]] (the TT and TTS versions are still popular as vintage race cars). NSU then focused on new rotary engines according to the ideas of [[Felix Wankel]]. In 1967, the new [[NSU Ro 80]] was a space-age car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, safety, et cetera, but teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. Presently several lines of Audi cars are produced in Neckarsulm.

The mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the K70, was intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic Ro 80. However, Volkswagen took the K70 for its own range, spelling the end of NSU as a separate brand.

===The modern era of Audi===
[[image:audi.quatro.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Audi Quattro]]
[[Image:Audi.tt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Audi TT]]

The first Audi of the modern era was the [[Audi 100]] of 1968. This was soon joined by the [[Audi 80|Audi 80/Fox]] (which formed the basis for the 1973 [[Volkswagen Passat]]) in 1972.

The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer [[Jorg Bensinger]] was accepted to develop the [[four-wheel drive]] technology in [[Volkswagen]]'s [[Iltis]] military vehicle for an Audi performance car and [[Rallying|rally]] racing car. The performance car was named the &quot;[[Quattro]],&quot; a turbocharged coupé which was also the first production vehicle to feature full-time all-wheel drive through a center [[differential]].  Commonly referred to as the &quot;Ur-Quattro&quot; (the &quot;[[Ur-]]&quot; prefix is a German [[augmentative]] used, in this case, to mean &quot;original&quot; and is also applied to the first generation of Audi's S4 and S6 sport sedans, as in &quot;UrS4&quot; and &quot;UrS6&quot;), few of these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team) but the model was a great success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars, and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology,  

In 1986, as the Passat-based Audi 80 was beginning to develop a kind of &quot;grandfather's car&quot; image, the type 89 was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option.) In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant [[Audi 90]], which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early nineties, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface.

This decline in sales was not helped in the [[United States|USA]] by a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' report which purported to show that Audi automobiles suffered from &quot;unintended acceleration&quot;. The ''60 Minutes'' report was based on customer reports of acceleration when the brake pedal was pushed. Independent investigators concluded that this was most likely due to a close placement of the accelerator and brake pedals (unlike American cars), and the inability, when not paying attention, to distinguish between the two. (In race cars, when manually downshifting under heavy braking, the accelerator has to be used in order to match revs properly, so both pedals have to be close to each other to be operated by the right foot at once, toes on the brake, heels on the gas. US citizens are used to automatic gearboxes and only two well separated pedals). This was never an issue in Europe, as Europeans in general use manual transmission gears, and have a &quot;feeling&quot; for vehicle revs in comparison to the speed of the car.

''60 Minutes'' ignored this fact and rigged a car to perform in an uncontrolled manner. The report immediately crushed Audi sales, and Audi renamed the affected model (The 5000 became the 100/200 in 1989, as in Germany and elsewhere). Audi had contemplated withdrawing from the American market until sales began to recover in the mid-1990s. The turning point for Audi was the sale of the new A4 in 1996, and with the release of the A4/6/8 series, which was developed together with VW and other sister brands (so called &quot;platforms&quot;).

Currently, Audi's sales are growing strongly in Europe, and the company is renowned for having the best build quality of any mainstream auto manufacturer. 2004 marked the 11th straight increase in sales, selling 779,441 vehicles worldwide. Record figures were recorded from 21 out of about 50 major sales markets. The largest sales increases came from Eastern Europe (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and the Middle East (+58.5%). In March of 2005, Audi is building its first two dealerships in India following its high increase in sales in that region. Though its brand still doesn't have the global cachet of [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[BMW]], Audi's reputation for quality and understated style has once again made it a highly desirable marque.

However, after 2003, with the release of the new A4, and in 2004 with the new A6, Audi's dedication to quality had finally paid off when it started to receive news reports and various vehicle critics praising Audis over [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]].

Audi has competed in (and sometimes dominated) numerous forms of [[auto racing]]. Audi's rich tradition in motorsport began with the [[Auto Union]] in the 1930s. In the 1990s Audi dominated the Touring and Super Touring categories of motor racing after success in circuit racing Stateside. 

===Rallying===
In 1980 Audi released the [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]], an [[all wheel drive]] turbocharged car that went on to win [[rally racing|rallies]] and races worldwide. It is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of all-wheel-drive in competition racing. Many critics doubted the viability of all-wheel-drive racers, thinking them to be too heavy and complex, yet the Quattro was an instant success, winning its first rally on its first outing. It won competition after competition for the next two years.

In 1984 Audi launched the &quot;[[Quattro|Sport Quattro]]&quot; car which dominated races in [[Monte Carlo]] and [[Sweden]] with Audi taking all podium finishes but succumbed to problems further into [[WRC|World Rally Championship]] contention. After another season mired in mediocre finishes, Walter Röhrl finished the season in his Sport Quattro S1 and helped place Audi second in the manufacturer's points. Audi also received rally honors in the [[Hong Kong]] to [[Beijing]] rally in that same year. Michèle Mouton, the first female WRC driver to win a championship and a driver for Audi, took the Sport Quattro S1, now simply called the S1 and raced in the [[Pikes Peak|Pikes Peak Hill Climb]]. The climb race pits a driver and car to drive up a 4,302 meter high mountain in [[Colorado]] and in 1985, Michèle Mouton set a new record of 11:25.39 and being the first woman to set a Pikes Peak record. In 1986, Audi formally left international rally racing following an accident in Portugal involving driver Joaquim Santos in his RS200. Santos swerved to avoid hitting spectators in the road, and left the track into the crowd of spectators on the side, killing three and injuring 30. [[Bobby Unser]] used an Audi in that same year to claim a new record for the Pikes Peak Hill Climb at 11:09.22.

===Motorsports in the USA===
In 1987, Walter Röhrl claimed the title for Audi setting a new record of 10:47.85 in his Audi S1 he retired from the WRC in 2 years earlier. The Audi S1 employed Audi's time-tested 5-cylinder turbo charged engine and generated over 600 hp (447 kW). The engine was mated to a 6-speed gearbox and ran on Audi's famous all-wheel drive system. All of Audi's top drivers drove this beast, Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Walter Röhrl and the female driver, Michèle Mouton. The Audi S1 enjoys a 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) time of 2.3 s. This Audi S1 started the S-series of cars for Audi which now represents an increased level of sports options and quality to the Audi line up.

As Audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing, they chose first into America with the [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am]] in 1988, 

In 1989, Audi moved to [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA GTO]] with the [[Audi 90|90]], however as they avoided the two major endurance events (Daytona and Sebring) despite winning on a regular basis, they would lose out on the title. 
===Touring cars===
In 1990, having completed their objective to market cars in the United States, Audi returned to Europe turning first to the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft|DTM]] series with the [[Audi V8]], then in 1993, being unwilling to build cars for the new formula, they turned their attention to the fast growing [[Supertouring]] series, which took place nationally, first in the [[French Supertourisme]] and [[Italian Superturismo]]. In the following year, Audi would switched to the German [[Super Tourenwagen]] (known as STW) and then to [[BTCC]] (British Touring Car Championship) the year after that.

The [[FIA]], having difficulty regulating the Quattro system and what impact it had on the competitors, would eventually ban all four wheel drive cars from competiting in 1998, by then Audi switched all their works efforts to sportscar racing.

By 2000, Audi would still compete in the US with their [[Audi RS4|RS4]] for the [[SPEED World Challenge|SCCA Speed World GT Challenge]], through dealer/team [[Champion Racing]] competing against Corvettes, Vipers, and smaller BMWs (where it is one of the few series to permit 4WD cars). In 2003, Champion Racing entered an [[Audi RS6|RS6]]. Once again, the quattro was superior and Champion Audi won the championship. They returned in 2004 to defend their title but a newcomer, Cadillac, gave them a run for their money.  After four victories in a row, the Audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply affected the car's performance.

In 2004, after years of competiting with the TT-R in the revitalised DTM series, with privateer team [[Abt|Abt Racing]] taking the 2002 title with [[Laurent Aiello]], Audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory supported [[Joest Racing]] [[Audi A4|A4s]].

===Sports car racing===
Beginning in 1999, Audi built the [[Audi R8 Race Car|Audi R8]] to compete in [[sports car racing]], including the [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP900]] class at the [[24 hours of Le Mans]]. The factory supported Joest Racing team won at Le Mans three times in a row (2000 - 2002), as well as winning every race in the [[American Le Mans]] Series in its first year. Audi also sold the car to customer teams such as [[Champion Racing]]. In 2003, two [[Bentley]] [[Bentley Speed 8|Speed 8]]s, with engines designed by Audi and driven by Joest drivers ''loaned'' to the fellow VW company, competed in the GTP class and finished the race in the top two positions, while the Champion Racing R8 finished third overall and first in the LMP900 class. Audi returned to the winner's circle at the 2004 race, with the top three finishers all driving R8s: Audi Sport Japan Team Goh finished first, Audi Sport UK Veloqx second, and Champion Racing third.

At the 2005 24 Hours of Le Mans, Champion Racing entered two R8s along with an R8 from the Audi PlayStation Team [[Oreca]].  The R8s (which were built to old LMP900 regulations) received a more narrow air inlet restrictor, cutting power, and an additional 50 kg of weight compared to the newer LMP1 chassis.  On average, the R8s were about 2-3 seconds off pace compared to the [[Pescarolo]]-[[Judd]].  But with a team of excellent drivers and experience, both Champion R8s were able to take first and third while the ORECA team took fourth. The Champion team was also the first American team to win Le Mans since the Gulf Ford GT's in 1967.  This also ends the long era of the R8, however its replacement for 2006, called the [[Audi R10]], was unveiled on December 13, 2005. the R10 employs many new features, including a twin-turbocharged diesel engine. Its first race will likely be the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring as a race-test for the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Technology==
Audi is the only car manufacturer that produces 100% [[galvanize]]d vehicles to prevent corrosion. Along with other precautionary measures, the thus achieved full-body [[zinc]] coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust and [[corrosion perforation]]. The body's resulting durability even surpassed Audi's own expectations, causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year [[warranty]] against corrosion perforation to currently 12 years. An all-[[aluminium]] car was brought forward by Audi, and in 1994 the Audi A8 was launched, which introduced aluminium [[space frame]] technology. Audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-nineties and continues to pursue leading-edge technology and high performance.

The all-aluminium concept was extended to the company's new [[sub-compact]], the [[Audi A2]] which was launched in 2001.

In the 1970's, some vehicle manufacturers including Audi (and [[Subaru]]) designed their own [[all wheel drive]] systems in passenger vehicles. In the 1980's, all-wheel drive systems in cars became a fad, and other manufacturers like [[Porsche]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] offered all-wheel drive systems in their cars to compete in the marketplace. Unfortunately, the all-wheel drive system in the Mercedes-Benz vehicles were riddled with problems right from the design sheet. The system also was not popular in Porsche vehicles because owners wanted the traditional performance of the [[rear wheel drive]] they got used to in older Porsches. Although Porsche and Mercedes-Benz offer all-wheel drive systems in some cars today, neither manufacturer was able to ride the fad and come out on top like Audi has. Today, after many decades of class-leading technology and engineering, the name ''[[quattro]]'' is an identifiable symbol and trademark that shows would-be competitors the level of quality they have to achieve in order to attempt to compete with Audi.

In the 1980s, Audi was the champion of the inline 5 cylinder, [[Engine displacement|2.1/2.2 L]] engine as a longer lasting alternative to more traditional 6 cylinder engines. This engine was used in not only production cars but also their race cars. The 2.1 L inline 5 cylinder engine was used as a base for the rally cars in the 1980's, providing well over 400 [[horsepower]] (298 kW) after modification. Before 1990, there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0 L and 2.3 L. This range of engine capacity was a good combination of good fuel economy which was on the mind of every motorist in the 1980's, and a good amount of power the customer wants.
Through the early 1990's, Audi began to move more towards the position of being a real competitor in it's target market against Mercedes-Benz and BMW. This began with the release of the Audi V8 in 1990. It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorprated in the bonnet. 

By 1991, Audi had the 4 cylinder [[Audi 80|Audi 80]], the 5 cylinder [[Audi 80|Audi 90]] and [[Audi 100|Audi 100]], the turbocharged [[Audi 100|Audi 200]] and the [[Audi V8|Audi V8]]. There was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4 and 5 cylinder engines.

Although the five cylinder engine was a successful and very robust powerplant, it was still a little too different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi 100 in 1992, Audi introduced a 2.8l V6 engine. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a choice of 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines, in sedan, coupe and cabriolet body styles.

The 5 cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice, however a turbocharged 230BHP (169kW) version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of the engine fitted to the Sport Quattro. It was fitted to the Audi Coupe and named the S2 and also to the Audi 100 body, and named the [[Audi S4|S4]]. These two models were the beginning of the mass produced S series of performance cars.

The [[Audi A8|Audi A8]] replaced the [[Audi V8|V8]] in 1994, with a revolutionary Aluminium Space Frame (ASF) to save weight. The weight reduction was offset by the quattro all-wheel drive system, however it meant the car had similar performance to its rivals, but far superior handling.

The next major model change was in 1995 when the [[Audi A4|Audi A4]] replaced the [[Audi 80|Audi 80]]. The new nomenclature scheme was applied to the Audi 100 to become the Audi A6 (with a minor facelift). This also meant the S4 became the [[Audi S6|S6]] and a new S4 was introduced in the A4 body. The S2 was discontinued. The [[Audi Cabriolet]] continued on (based on the Audi 80 platform) until 1999, gaining the engine upgrades along the way. A new [[Audi A3|A3]] (based on the [[VW Golf|Volkswagen Golf]]) was introduced to the range in 1997, and the radical [[Audi TT|TT]] coupe and roadster were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings. Another interesting model introduced was the [[Mercedes Benz|Mercedes-Benz]] A-Class competitor, the [[Audi A2|Audi A2]]. The model sold relatively well in Europe, however Audi decided not to develop a new model and it has since been discontinued as of 2004.

The engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 1.8 L 4 cylinder, 1.8 turbo, 2.6 L and 2.8 L V6, 2.2 L turbo-charged 5 cylinder and the 4.2 L V8. The V6's were replaced by new 2.4 and 2.8 L 30V V6's in 1998, with marked improvement in power, torque and smoothness. Further engines were added along the way, including a 3.7 L V8 and 6.0 L W12 for the A8.

At the turn of the century, Audi introduced the [[direct shift gearbox]] (DSG), a manual transmission driveable like an automatic transmission. The system includes dual electrohydraulically controlled clutches instead of a [[torque converter]]. This is implemented in some [[Volkswagen Golf]], [[Audi A3]] and [[Audi TT|TT]] models. The engine range was continually upgraded, with a 2.7 L twin turbo V6 being offered in the Audi S4, A6 and allroad, the 2.8 L V6 was replaced by a 3.0 L unit.

New models of the A3, A4, A6 and A8 have been introduced, with the 1.8 L engine now 2.0 L and the 3.0 L V6 is now 3.1 L in size. Audi has now introduced [[FSI|FSI]] on some of their engines, including the 1.6 L 4 cylinder, a new 2.0 L (Audi was the first manufacturer in the world to utilize a turbo charger and FSI on the same powerplant), and the 3.1 L V6. This is a direct fuel-injection technique that Audi had also used on its diesel engines since the early 1980s.

As a premium member of the VW Group, technologies are frequently first introduced to the mass market with Audi vehicles before being 'trickled down' to more value oriented brands such as VW, [[SEAT]] and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]]. Recent examples of this include DSG and FSI.

Audi now has an impressive range of cars, engines and transmissions available, which continue to lead the way and introduce new technologies into the market.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:jal.747.newcolours.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A [[Japan Airlines]] [[Boeing]] [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]]. This is a wide-bodied long-haul '''aircraft''']]
An '''aircraft''' is any [[machine]] capable of [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[flight]].

&lt;!--English word &quot;aircraft&quot; is singuar and plural with no &quot;s&quot;. See also the link to Wiktionary below.--&gt;
==Categories and classification==
Aircraft fall into two broad categories: 

===Heavier than air===
Heavier than air [[aerodyne]]s, including  [[autogyro]]s, [[helicopter]]s and variants, and conventional [[fixed-wing aircraft]] (airplanes or aeroplanes). Fixed-wing aircraft generally use an [[internal-combustion engine]] in the form of a [[piston engine]] (with a [[propeller]]) or a [[Turbine|turbine engine]] ([[Jet engine|jet]] or [[turboprop]]), to provide [[thrust]] that moves the craft forward through the air. The movement of air over the airfoil produces [[lift (force)|lift]] that causes the  aircraft to fly. Exceptions are [[glider]]s which have no engines and gain their thrust, initially, from [[winch]]es or tugs and then from gravity and thermal currents. For a glider to maintain its forward speed it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Helicopters and autogyros use a spinning rotor (a ''rotary wing'') to provide lift; helicopters also use the rotor to provide thrust. The abbreviation [[VTOL]] is applied to aircraft other than helicopters that can take off or land vertically. [[STOL]] stands for Short Take Off and Landing.

===Lighter than air===
[[image:yellow.balloon.takesoff.in.bath.arp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A hot air balloon takes off from Royal Victoria Park, Bath, England]]

[[Lighter than air]] [[aerostat]]s: [[hot air balloon]]s and [[airship]]s. Aerostats use [[buoyancy]] to float in the air in much the same manner as ships float on the water.  In particular, these aircraft use a relatively low density gas such as [[helium]], [[hydrogen]] or heated air, to displace the air around the craft. The distinction between a balloon and an airship is that an airship has some means of controlling both its forward motion and steering itself, while balloons are carried along with the wind.

===Types of aircraft===
:''See also: [[List of aircraft]]''

There are several ways to classify aircraft. Below, we describe classifications by design, propulsion and usage.

====By design====
[[image:Size-comparison.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A size Comparation of some of the largest airplanes in the world. The Airbus A380-800, the Boeing 747-400 (largest airliner to date) The Antonov An-225 (aircraft with the greatest payload) and the Hughes H-4 &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; (largest airplane in the world) designed by the famous [[Howard Hughes]] ]]
A first division by design among aircraft is between lighter-than-air, '''aerostat''', and heavier-than-air aircraft, '''aerodyne'''.

Examples of lighter-than-air aircraft include non-steerable [[balloon]]s, such as [[hot air balloon]]s and [[gas balloon]]s, and steerable [[airship]]s (sometimes called dirigible balloons) such as [[blimp]]s (that have non-rigid construction) and [[rigid airship|rigid airships]] that have an internal frame. The most successful type of rigid airship was the [[Zeppelin]].  Several accidents,  such as the [[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]] fire at [[Lakehurst]], NJ, in [[1937]] led to the demise of large rigid airships.

In heavier-than-air aircraft, there are two ways to produce lift: aerodynamic lift and engine lift. In the case of aerodynamic lift, the aircraft is kept in the air by wings or rotors (see [[aerodynamics]]). With engine lift, the aircraft defeats gravity by use of [[vertical]] 
Examples of engine lift aircraft are [[rocket]]s, and [[VTOL]] aircraft such as the [[Hawker-Siddeley Harrier]].

Among aerodynamically lifted aircraft, most fall in the category of [[fixed-wing aircraft]], where horizontal airfoils produce [[lift (force)|lift]], by profiting from airflow patterns determined by [[Bernoulli's equation]] and, to some extent, the [[Coanda effect]].

The forerunner of these type of aircraft is the [[Kite flying|kite]]. Kites depend upon the tension between the cord which anchors it to the ground and the force of the [[wind]] currents.  Much aerodynamic work was done with kites until test aircraft, wind tunnels and now computer modelling programs became available.  

In a &quot;conventional&quot; configuration, the lift surfaces are placed in front of a control surface or [[tailplane]]. The other configuration is the [[canard]] where small horizontal control surfaces are placed forward of the wings, near the nose of the aircraft. Canards are becoming more common as [[supersonic]] [[aerodynamic]]s grows more mature and because the forward surface contributes lift during straight-and-level flight.

The number of lift surfaces varied in the pre-[[1950]] period, as [[biplane]]s (two wings) and [[triplane]]s (three wings) were numerous in the early days of aviation. Subsequently most aircraft are [[monoplane]]s. This is principally an improvement in [[structure]]s and not aerodynamics.

Other possibilities include the [[delta-wing]], where lift and horizontal control surfaces are often combined, and the [[flying wing]], where there is no separate vertical control surface (e.g. the [[B-2 Spirit]]).

A variable geometry ('swing-wing') has also been employed in a few examples of combat aircraft (the [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]], [[Panavia Tornado]], [[F-14 Tomcat]] and [[B-1 Lancer]], among others).

The [[lifting body]] configuration is where the body itself produce lift. So far the only significant practical application of the lifting body is in the [[Space Shuttle]], but many aircraft generate lift from nothing other than wings alone.

A second category of aerodynamically lifted aircraft are the [[rotary-wing aircraft]]. Here, the lift is provided by rotating [[aerofoil]]s or [[rotor]]s. The best-known examples are the [[helicopter]], the [[autogyro]] and the [[tiltrotor]] aircraft (such as the [[V-22 Osprey]]). Some craft have reaction-powered rotors with gas jets at the tips but most have one or more lift rotors powered from engine-driven shafts.

A further category might encompass the [[ground effect|wing-in-ground-effect]] types, for example the Russian [[ekranoplan]] also nicknamed the &quot;Caspian Sea Monster&quot; and [[hovercraft]]; most of the latter employing a skirt and achieving limited ground or water clearance to reduce friction and achieve speeds above those achieved by [[boat]]s of similar weight.

A recent innovation is a completely new class of aircraft, the [[fan wing]]. This uses a fixed wing with a forced airflow produced by cylindrical fans mounted above. It is (2005) in development in the [[United Kingdom]].

And finally the flapping-wing [[ornithopter]] is a category of its own. These designs may have potential but are not yet practical.

====By propulsion====
[[Image:WestCoastAirFloatplane.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[turboprop]]-engined [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DeHavilland Twin Otter]] adapted as a [[floatplane]].]]
Some types of aircraft, such as the balloon or [[glider]], do not have any propulsion. Balloons drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude).  For gliders, takeoff takes place from a high location, or the aircraft is pulled into the air by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or towed aloft by a powered &quot;tug&quot; aircraft.  [[Airship]]s combine a balloon's [[buoyancy]] with some kind of propulsion, usually [[propeller]] driven.

Until [[World War II]], the [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion piston engine]] was virtually the only type of propulsion used for powered aircraft. (See also: [[Aircraft engine]].)  The piston engine is still used in the majority of aircraft produced, since it is efficient at the lower altitudes used by small aircraft, but the [[radial engine]] (with the cylinders arranged in a circle around the [[crankshaft]]) has largely given way to the [[horizontally-opposed engine]] (with the cylinders lined up on two sides of the crankshaft).  Water cooled [[V engine]]s, as used in automobiles, were common in high speed aircraft, until they were replaced by jet and turbine power.  Piston engines typically operate using [[avgas]] or regular gasoline, though some new ones are being designed to operate on diesel or jet fuel.  Piston engines normally become less efficient above 7,000-8,000 ft (2100-2400 m) above sea level because there is less oxygen available for combustion; to solve that problem, some piston engines have mechanically powered compressors (blowers) or turbine-powered [[turbocharger]]s or turbonormalizers that compress the air before feeding it into the engine; these piston engines can often operate efficiently at 20,000 ft (6100 m) above sea level or higher, altitudes that require the use of supplemental oxygen or cabin pressurisation. 
During the forties and especially following the [[1973 energy crisis]], development work was done on propellers with swept tips or even scimitar-shaped blades for use in high-speed commercial and military transports.

Pressurised aircraft, however, are more likely to use the [[turbine|turbine engine]], since it is naturally efficient at higher altitudes and can operate above 40,000 ft. Helicopters also typically use turbine engines.  In addition to turbine engines like the [[turboprop]] and [[jet engine|turbojet]], other types of high-altitude, high-performance engines have included the [[ramjet]] and the [[pulse jet]].  [[Rocket aircraft]] have occasionally been experimented with. They are restricted to rather specialised niches, such as [[spaceflight]], where no oxygen is available for combustion (rockets carry their own oxygen).

====By usage====
The major distinction in aircraft usage is between [[military aviation]], which includes all uses of aircraft for military purposes (such as combat, patrolling, search and rescue, reconnaissance, transport, and training), and [[civil aviation]], which includes all uses of aircraft for non-military purposes.  

=====[[Military aircraft]]=====
[[Image:4781.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A prototype of [[Hindustan Aeronautics]]' [[Light Combat Aircraft]].]]
Combat aircraft like fighters or bombers represent only a minority of the category.  Many civil aircraft have been produced in separate models for military use, such as the civil [[Douglas DC-3]] airliner, which became the military [[C-47]]/C-53/R4D transport in the U.S. military and the &quot;Dakota&quot; in the U.K. and the [[Commonwealth]].  Even the small fabric-covered two-seater [[Piper Cub|Piper J3 Cub]] had a military version, the L-4 liaison, observation and trainer aircraft.  In the past, gliders and balloons have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War I]], and cargo gliders were used during [[World War II]] to land intruding German troops in a few European countries in the 1940-42 period, while Allied troops used them in landings on [[Sicily]] and [[Italy]], 1943, and in Western Europe [France and Holland] on [[D-Day]] (the [[Normandy]] 6 June 1944 [[Operation Overlord]] invasion) and in [[Operation Anvil-Dragoon]] (1944) and in [[Operation Market Garden]] (1944).  

Combat aircraft themselves, though used a handful of times for reconnaissance and [[surveillance aircraft|surveillance]] during the [[Italo-Turkish War]], did not come into widespread use until the [[Balkan War]] when [[first air-dropped bomb]] was invented and widely used by [[Bulgarian air force]] against [[Turkey]]. During [[World War I]] many types of aircraft were adapted for attacking the ground or enemy vehicles/ships/guns/aircraft, and the first aircraft designed as [[bomber]]s were born. In order to prevent the enemy from bombing, [[fighter aircraft]] were developed to intercept and shoot down enemy aircraft. [[Tanker (aircraft)|Tanker]]s were developed after [[World War II]] to refuel other aircraft in mid-air, thus increasing their operational range.  By the time of the [[Vietnam War]], [[helicopter]]s had come into widespread military use, especially for transporting, supplying, and supporting ground troops.

=====Civil aviation=====
[[image:heli.g-code.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Bell 206|Bell 206B JetRanger III]] '''[[helicopter]]''']]
Civil aviation includes both scheduled airline flights and [[general aviation]], a catch-all covering other kinds of private and commercial use.  The vast majority of flights flown around the world each day belong to the general aviation category, ranging from recreational balloon flying to civilian flight training to business trips to firefighting to medevac flights to cargo transportation on [[freight aircraft]].

Within general aviation, the major distinction is between private flights (where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses) and commercial flights (where the pilot is paid by a customer or employer).  Private pilots use aircraft primarily for personal travel, business travel, or recreation. Usually these private pilots own their own aircraft and take out loans from banks or specialized lenders to purchase them. Commercial general aviation pilots use aircraft for a wide range of tasks, such as flight training, pipeline surveying, passenger and freight transport, policing, crop dusting, and medical transport ([[medevac]]). Piston-powered propeller aircraft (single-engine or twin-engine) are especially common for both private and commercial general aviation, but even private pilots occasionally own and operate helicopters like the [[Bell 206|Bell JetRanger]] or turboprops like the [[Beechcraft King Air]]. Business jets are typically flown by commercial pilots, although there is a new generation of small jets arriving soon for private pilots.

'''Aphex Twin''' (born '''Richard David James''', [[August 18]], [[1971]], [[Ireland]]) is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[electronic music]] artist, credited with pushing forward the genres of [[techno music|techno]], [[ambient music|ambient]],  [[Acid (electronic music)|acid]], and [[drum and bass]]. He has been described as &quot;the most inventive and influential figure in contemporary electronic music&quot; ([http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,563163,00.html]).

==Biography==
Richard David James was born to [[Wales|Welsh]] parents Lorna and Derek James in [[1971]] in [[Limerick, Ireland]]. James spent his childhood in [[Cornwall, United Kingdom]]. As a teenager, he became a [[DJ]] and [[musician]] on the local [[rave party|rave]] scene, taking on the [[moniker]] &quot;Aphex Twin&quot;. James formed the [[Rephlex Records]] label in [[1991]] with his friend [[Grant Wilson-Claridge]] and released his first records on this label, as well as [[Mighty Force]] and [[R&amp;S Records]] of [[Belgium]]. After success with his early work, James relocated to [[London]] and released a slew of albums and [[EP (format)|EPs]] on the [[Warp Records]] label, under a bewildering set of aliases (from AFX and Polygon Window to the lesser known Gak and Power Pill). 

In [[1996]], he began releasing more material composed on computers, and embraced a more [[drum and bass]] sound mixed with a nostalgic childhood theme and strange computer generated acid lines. The early adoption of [[Native Instruments]]' softsynthesizers predated the later popularity of using computers to make music. The late 1990s saw his music become more popular and mainstream, as he released two singles, &quot;Come to Daddy&quot;, and &quot;Windowlicker&quot;, which were shown on [[MTV]] and the covers of music magazines including [[NME]]. 

[[Image:Aphex Twin logo.png|frame|right|The Aphex Twin Logo, present on most Aphex Twin/AFX releases.]]

In [[2001]] Aphex Twin released his most personal album yet, ''[[drukqs]]'', a 2-CD album which featured [[prepared piano]] songs under the influence of [[Erik Satie]] and [[John Cage]]. Also included were abrasive, fast, and meticulously programmed computer-made songs. The level of detail and artistry was so high, that reviewers and fans complained that the music was less in the style of innovative pop music, and more about detailed beautiful and personal musical art.  ''[[drukqs]]'' is perhaps Richard's most controversial album to date; the album lacked the novelty found in his other albums, so reviewers guessed this album was released as a contract breaker with Warp Records - a credible guess, as James' next big release came out on his own Rephlex label. It is also rumored that the album drukqs was released as it was because he had almost all of these songs on a creative jukebox that he forgot and left on a plane, and in fear of all of the tracks being leaked to the internet, its release was rushed as to avoid this.

In late 2004, rumours of James' return to a more [[acid techno]] based sound were realised with the ''[[Analord]]'' series. For these records, James used his extensive collection of [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[drum machine]]s which he bought when they were still at bargain prices. Also he used one of the rarest, and most desirable [[synthesizer]]s of his generation, the [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb99/articles/syntonfenix883.htm Synton Fenix], and the notoriously difficult to program [[Roland MC-4]] [[sequencer]] (a sequencer with a reputation for excellent timing), as well as the infamous [[Roland TB-303]] for his trademark acid melodies.

Apart from music, Richard D. James is a talented [[photography|photographer]], having done his own artwork direction for many of his albums. On the &quot;Windowlicker&quot; single, James hid a picture of his face (created most likely with [http://www.uisoftware.com/MetaSynth/index.html Metasynth]) in the second track (commonly referred to as &quot;[Formula]&quot;, &quot;[Symbol]&quot;, or &quot;[Equation]&quot;), which can be seen in a [http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,52426,00.html spectral] [http://www.bastwood.com/aphex.php analysis] of the track. The picture illustrates his famous toothy, evil grin.

===Aphex Twin's influences===

James has stated in numerous interviews that he has no musical influences other than himself. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,563163,00.html] He claims to have listened rarely to songs on the [[radio]] as a child and that he is unable to read [[Musical notation|sheet music]].

Conversely, James has said that he has listened to many bands and artists for inspiration and sampling (notably [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] for their [[Break (music)|breaks]] (used as break beats), but he has also expressed appreciation for [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]). He signed fellow musicans and personal friends Tom &quot;[[Squarepusher]]&quot; Jenkinson and Mike Paradinas ([[µ-ziq]]) to his [[Rephlex Records|Rephlex]] record label, as well as [[Luke Vibert]].

Other debated influences include:

&lt;!--Please keep list alphabetical--&gt;
* [[808 State]] for whom he has done remix work.
* [[John Cage]] and his [[prepared piano]] technique (itself inspired by [[Henry Cowell]] and [[Erik Satie]] independently) in the piano pieces on ''Drukqs''
* [[Coil (band)|Coil]]
* [[Tod Dockstader]] An electronic musician who worked with tape, mangling sounds into music of the frequency and dynamics spectrum.
* [[Mike Dred]]  Acid Techno pioneer and [[Techno]] [[Electroacoustic]] hybrid pioneer (together with Peter Green) on Dred's &quot;Machine Codes&quot; label.  James is quoted as saying that he listened to Dred &amp; Green's ''Virtual Farmer'' LP 21 times in a row when he first heard it.
* [[Brian Eno]] pioneer of ambient music, and for the artwork of his ambient records.
* [[Larry Heard]] (One song on ''Analord 02'' is called Laricheard, an obvious [[pun]] on the names Larry Heard and Richard, as the song resembles Mr. Fingers/Larry Heard track &quot;Amnesia&quot;.)
* [[Kraftwerk]] and their electropop styles.
* Kevin 'Master Reese' Saunderson
* [[Derrick May]] Techno pioneer.
* [[Joe Meek]], especially ''I Heard A New World'' album of this pioneering 1960s UK producer.
* [[Erik Satie]] whose melodic style was borrowed on ''Drukqs''.
* [[Squarepusher]] and [[Luke Vibert]] for their extreme versions of drum and bass.

===Influence of Aphex Twin on others===
Fans and journalists coined the genre names [[intelligent dance music|IDM]] and [[drill and bass]] to describe Aphex Twin's novel approach to dance music. Richard's own Rephlex Records label, which he co-owns with [[Grant Wilson-Claridge]] prefers the term &quot;Braindance&quot;.

These labels have proven useful for upcoming artists looking to find a genre name for their own music, influenced by Aphex Twin and Warp Records. In Aphex Twin's words on the 'Intelligent Dance Music' label: &quot;I just think it's really funny to have terms like that. It's basically saying 'this is intelligent and everything else is stupid.' It's really nasty to everyone else's music. (laughs) It makes me laugh, things like that. I don't use names. I just say that I like something or I don't.&quot;

Aphex Twin tends to distance himself from rock/pop music, yet he has still had an influence on the rock bands like  [[Radiohead]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Peace Burial at Sea]]. Aphex Twin dismissed going on tour with Radiohead: &quot;I wouldn't play with them since I don't like them.&quot;[http://www.kludgemagazine.com/interviews.php?id=82]

==Aphex Twin's press==
Aphex Twin press interviews are generally entertaining, eccentric, and confusing. 

Aphex Twin has a reputation for lying in interviews, which he has [http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,563163,00.html admitted] to the Guardian newspaper. It is now been confirmed that Richard does own a tank (actually a 1950s armoured scout car, the [[Daimler]] Ferret Mark 3), a [[submarine]] bought from Russia, composing ambient techno at age 13 (contradicting most music history), having &quot;over 100 hours&quot; of unreleased music (including songs on his [[answering machine]] that could be wiped away by leaving a message), being able to incorporate [[lucid dreaming]] into the process of making music.
He lives in a converted bank in SE16 London, which was formerly the Bank of Cyprus and then HSBC.

It has now been confirmed by Richard`s close friends that he has built his own synthesizers and samplers from scratch in his early years. Richard once built a sampler box for his degree in microelectronics, and a photograph and article of it was taken for a UK electronic music magazine Future music. Richard is experienced in electronics and electricity, and has modified and [[circuit bending|circuit bent]] his equipment from a young age.

He has made his own software to compose with, including algorithmic processes which automatically generate beats and melodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AlfredNobel.jpg|thumb|200px|Alfred Nobel]]

{{Audio|sv-Alfred_Nobel.ogg|'''Alfred Bernhard Nobel'''}} ([[October 21]], [[1833]], [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] &amp;ndash; [[December 10]], [[1896]], [[San Remo, Italy]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]]  chemist, engineer, pacifist, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the [[inventor]] of [[dynamite]]. He owned [[Bofors]], a major armaments manufacturer, that he had redirected from its previous role as an iron and steel mill. In his last will, he used his enormous fortune to institute the [[Nobel Prize]]s. The [[synthetic element]] [[Nobelium]] was named after him.

==Personal background==
Alfred Nobel, a descendant of the 17th century scientist, [[Olaus Rudbeck]] (1630-1702), was the third son of [[Immanuel Nobel]] (1801-1872). Born in [[Stockholm]], he went with his family at an early age to [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], where his father (who had invented modern [[plywood]]) started a [[naval mine|&quot;torpedo&quot;]] works. In 1859 this was left to the care of the second son, [[Ludvig Nobel|Ludvig Emmanuel]] (1831-1888), by whom it was greatly enlarged, and Alfred, returning to Sweden with his father after the bankruptcy of their family business, devoted himself to the study of [[explosives]], and especially to the safe manufacture and use of [[nitroglycerine]] (discovered in 1847 by [[Ascanio Sobrero]], one of his  fellow-students under [[Théophile-Jules Pelouze]] at the [[University of Torino]]). Several explosions were reported at their family-owned factory in [[Heleneborg, Sweden|Heleneborg]], and a disastrous one in 1864 killed Alfred's younger brother Emil and several other workers.

Less well known is that Alfred Nobel was also a playwright. His only play, ''[[Nemesis (Nobel)|Nemesis]]'', a prose tragedy in four acts about [[Beatrice Cenci]], partly inspired by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s blank verse tragedy in five acts [[The Cenci]], was printed when he was dying, and the whole stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. The first surviving edition (bilingual Swedish-[[Esperanto]]) was published in Sweden in 2003. The play has not yet (May 2003) been translated into any language other than Esperanto. 

Alfred Nobel is buried in the [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in [[Stockholm]].

== Dynamite ==
Nobel found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like [[diatomaceous earth|kieselguhr]] (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to manipulate, and this mixture he [[patent]]ed in 1867 as [[dynamite]]. 

He next combined nitroglycerin with another high explosive, [[gun-cotton]], and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a still more powerful explosive than dynamite. [[Gelignite|Blasting gelatin]], as it was called, was patented in 1876, and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of [[potassium nitrate]], wood-pulp and various other substances. 

Some years later Nobel produced [[ballistite]], one of the earliest of the nitroglycerin [[smokeless gunpowder]]s, containing in its latest forms about equal parts of gun-cotton and nitroglycerin. This powder was a precursor of [[cordite]], and Nobel's claim that his patent covered the latter was the occasion of vigorously contested law-suits between him and the [[United Kingdom|British]] Government in 1894 and 1895. Cordite also consists of nitroglycerin and gun-cotton, but the form of the latter which its inventors wished to use was the most highly nitrated variety, which is not soluble in mixtures of [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]], whereas Nobel contemplated using a less nitrated form, which is soluble in such mixtures. The question was complicated by the fact that it is in practice impossible to prepare either of these two forms without admixture of the other; eventually the courts decided against Nobel. Cordite became a mainstay munition of the British empire throughout the late 19th and early 20th century.

From the manufacture of dynamite and other explosives, and from the exploitation of the [[Baky|Baku]] oil-fields, in the development of which he and his brothers, Ludvig and Robert Hjalmar (1829-1896), took a leading part, he amassed an immense fortune.

==Armaments Manufacturer==
A less well remembered aspect of his life was his role in setting up a major armaments manufacturer, [[Bofors]] Defence AB. He was Bofors most famous owner, and owned the company from 1894 until his death in December of 1896. He had the key role in reshaping this iron manufacturer to a modern cannon manufacturer and chemical industry.

Bofors went on to become a major supplier of howitzers, cannons and field guns to armies around the world, including the USA and many Third-World dictatorships.

== The Prizes ==

The erroneous publication in 1888 of a [[List of premature obituaries|premature obituary]] of Nobel by a French newspaper, condemning his invention of dynamite, is said to have made him decide to leave a better legacy to the world after his death.

On [[November 27]], [[1895]] at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in [[Paris]], Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the [[Nobel Prize]]s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. He died of a [[stroke]] on [[December 10]], [[1896]] at [[San Remo]], [[Italy]].  The amount set aside for the Nobel Prize foundation was 31 million kronor.

The first three of these prizes are for eminence in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physical science]], in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry]] and in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|medical science or physiology]]; the fourth is for the most remarkable [[Nobel Prize for Literature|literary work]] &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; and [[Nobel Peace Prize|the fifth]] is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international brother/sisterhood, in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of [[peace]] congresses.

The formulation about the literary prize, &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; (Swedish ''i idealisk riktning''), is cryptic and has caused much consternation. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted &quot;ideal&quot; as &quot;idealistic&quot; (in Swedish ''idealistisk''), and used it as a pretext to not give the prize to important but less [[Romanticism|romantic]] authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[August Strindberg]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. This interpretation has been revised, and the prize given to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[José Saramago]], who definitely do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.

When reading ''Nemesis'' in its original Swedish and looking at his own philosophical and literary standpoint, it seems possible that his intention might have been rather the opposite of that first believed - that the prize should be given to authors who fight for their ideals ''against'' such authorities as God, Church and State.

There was also quite a lot of room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament he stipulated that the money should go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but he had not left instructions on how to do the split between science and technology.  Since the deciding bodies he had chosen in these domains were more concerned with science than technology it is not surprising that the prizes went to scientists and not to engineers, technicians or other inventors.  In a sense the technological prizes announced recently by the [[World Technology Network]] are an indirect (and thus not funded by the Nobel foundation) continuation of the wishes of Nobel, as he set them out in his testament.

In 2001, his great-grandnephew, Peter, asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given &quot;in Alfred Nobel's memory&quot; from the five other awards.  This has caused much controversy whether the prize for [[Economics]] is actually a &quot;Nobel Prize&quot; (see [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]]).

==Nobel Prize rumors==
* There is no Nobel Prize for mathematics. A common legend states that Nobel decided against a prize in mathematics because a woman he proposed to (or his wife, or his mistress) rejected him or cheated on him with a famous mathematician, often claimed to be [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]]. There is no historical evidence to support the story, and Nobel was never married.

'''Alexander Graham Bell''' ([[March 3]], [[1847]] &amp;ndash; [[August 2]], [[1922]]) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]]-[[United States|American]] [[scientist]] and [[inventor]].  Today, he is still widely considered to be the inventor of the [[telephone]], although this matter has become [[Invention of the telephone#Controversy|controversial]], with a number of people claiming that [[Antonio Meucci]] was the 'real' inventor and others holding out for [[Elisha Gray]], the founder of the [[Western Electric]] Manufacturing Company. In addition to his work in [[telecommunications]] technology, he was responsible for important advances in [[aviation]] and [[hydrofoil]] technology.

==Biography==
Born '''Alexander Bell''' in [[Edinburgh]], he later adopted the middle name ''Graham'' out of admiration for Alexander Graham, a family friend.  Many called him &quot;the father of the Deaf.&quot;  This title is somewhat ironic due to his belief in the practice of Eugenics.  He hoped to one day eradicate deafness from the population.

His family was associated with the teaching of [[elocution]]: his grandfather in [[London]], his uncle in [[Dublin]], and his father, [[Alexander Melville Bell]], in Edinburgh, were all professed elocutionists. The latter has published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are well known, especially his treatise on [[Visible Speech]], which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. In this he explains his method of instructing [[deaf mutes]], by means of their [[eyesight]], how to articulate words, and also how to read what other persons are saying by the motions of their [[lip]]s.

Alexander Graham Bell was educated at the [[Royal High School]] of Edinburgh, from which he graduated at the age of 13. At the age of 16 he secured a position as a pupil-teacher of elocution and music in [[Weston House Academy]], at [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], [[Moray]], Scotland. The next year he spent at the [[University of Edinburgh]].  He was graduated from University College London.

From 1866 to 1867, he was an instructor at [[Somersetshire College]] at [[Bath, England|Bath]], [[Somerset]], [[England]].

While still in Scotland he is said to have turned his attention to the science of [[acoustics]], with a view to ameliorate the deafness of his mother.

In 1870, at the age of 23, he [[emigrated]] with his family to [[Canada]] where they settled at [[Brantford]]. Before he left Scotland, Bell had turned his attention to [[telephony]], and in Canada he continued an interest in communication machines. He designed a piano which could transmit its music to a distance by means of electricity. In 1873, he accompanied his father to [[Montreal]], Canada, where he was employed in teaching the system of visible speech. The elder Bell was invited to introduce the system into a large day-school for mutes at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], but he declined the post in favor of his son, who became Professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at [[Boston University]]'s School of Oratory. 

[[Image:1876 Bell Speaking into Telephone.jpg|thumb|Bell speaking into prototype model of the telephone]]
At [[Boston University]] he continued his research in the same field, and endeavored to produce a telephone which would not only send musical notes, but articulate speech. With financing from his American father-in-law, on [[March 7]], [[1876]], the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] granted him [[Patent]] Number 174,465 covering &quot;the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound&quot;, the [[telephone]].

After obtaining the patent for the telephone, Bell continued his many experiments in communication, which culminated in the invention of the photophone-transmission of sound on a beam of [[light]] &amp;mdash; a precursor of today's [[fiber optics|optical fiber]] systems. He also worked in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the eighteen patents granted in his name alone and the twelve he shared with his collaborators. These included fourteen for the telephone and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], four for the [[photophone]], one for the [[phonograph]], five for aerial vehicles, four for hydroairplanes, and two for a [[selenium]] cell.

Bell had many great ideas that are now real inventions.  During his Volta Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record, as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they were unable to develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder, the computer, and the CD-ROM. 

Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his [[Canada|Canadian]] estate in [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]], [[Nova Scotia]], he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses. 

In 1882, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. In 1888, he was one of the founding members of the [[National Geographic Society]] and became its second president. He was the recipient of many honors. The [[France|French Government]] conferred on him the decoration of the [[Légion d'honneur]] (Legion of Honor), the [[Académie française]] bestowed on him the [[Volta Prize]] of 50,000 francs, the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in London awarded him the [[Albert medal]] in 1902, and the University of [[Würzburg]], [[Bavaria]], granted him a Ph.D. He was awarded the [[AIEE]]'s [[Edison Medal]] in 1914 for &quot;For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone.&quot;

Bell married Mabel Hubbard, who was one of his pupils at Boston University, as well as a deaf-mute, on [[July 11]], [[1877]]. His invention of the telephone was actually a device he was trying to create that would allow him to communicate with his wife and his deaf mother. He died at Beinn Bhreagh, located on [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[Cape Breton Island]] near the village of [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]], in 1922 and is buried alongside his wife atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain overlooking [[Bras d'Or Lake]]. He was survived by two of their four children.

Bell was listed among the [[100 Greatest Britons]], [[The Greatest American|the 100 Greatest Americans]] and in the top ten [[The Greatest Canadian|Greatest Canadians]], the only person to be on more than one list. 

====Bell and decibel====
The ''bel'' (B) is a unit of measurement invented by [[Bell Labs]] and named after Bell. The bel was too large for everyday use, so the [[decibel]] (dB), equal to 0.1 B, became more commonly used.
The dB is commonly used as a unit for measuring sound intensity.

===The photophone===
Another of Bell's inventions was the [[photophone]], a device enabling the transmission of sound over a beam of light, which he developed together with [[Charles Sumner Tainter]]. The device employed light-sensitive cells of crystalline [[selenium]], which has the property that its [[electrical resistance]] varies inversely with the illumination (i.e., the resistance is higher when the material is in the dark, and lower when it is lighted). The basic principle was to modulate a beam of light directed at a receiver made of crystalline selenium, to which a [[telephone]] was attached. The modulation was done either by means of a vibrating mirror, or a rotating disk periodically obscuring the light beam.

This idea was by no means new. Selenium had been discovered by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] in 1817, and the peculiar properties of crystalline or granulate selenium were discovered by [[Willoughby Smith]] in 1873. In 1878, one writer with the initials J.F.W. from [[Kew]] described such an arrangement in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in a column appearing on [[June 13]], asking the readers whether any experiments in that direction had already been done. In his paper on the photophone, Bell credited one [[A. C. Browne]] of [[London]] with the independent discovery in 1878&amp;mdash;the same year Bell became aware of the idea. Bell and Tainter, however, were apparently the first to perform a successful experiment, by no means any easy task, as they even had to produce the selenium cells with the desired resistance characteristics themselves.

In one experiment in [[Washington, D.C.]] the sender and the receiver were placed on different buildings some 700 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] (213 [[metre]]s) apart. The sender consisted of a mirror directing sunlight onto the mouthpiece, where the light beam was modulated by a vibrating mirror, focused by a [[optical device|lens]] and directed at the receiver, which was simply a [[parabolic]] reflector with the selenium cells in the [[focus]] and the telephone attached. With this setup, Bell and Tainter succeeded to communicate clearly.

The photophone was [[patent]]ed on [[December 18]] [[1880]], but the quality of communication remained poor and the research was not pursued by Bell.

===Metal detector===
Bell is also credited with the invention of the [[metal detector]] in 1881. The device was hurriedly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James Garfield]]. The metal detector worked, but didn't find the bullet because the metal bedframe the President was lying on confused the instrument. Bell gave a full account of his experiments in a paper read before the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in August 1882.  Though unsuccessful in its first incarnation, this achievement would eventually change the nature of physical security.
