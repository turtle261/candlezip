and [[Robert Hetzron]], have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic, but this view has yet to gain general acceptance.

There is little agreement on the subclassification of the five or six branches mentioned; however, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), [[Harold Fleming]] (1981), and [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1981) all agree that Omotic was the first branch to split from the rest. Otherwise, 
*Ehret groups Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic together in a North Afro-Asiatic subgroup; 
*[[Paul Newman (professor)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic; 
*Fleming (1981) divided non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or &quot;Erythraean&quot;, into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian; he later added Semitic and Beja to the latter, and proposed [[Ongota language|Ongotá]] as a tentative new third branch of Erythraean;  
*[[Lionel Bender]] (1997) advocates a &quot;Macro-Cushitic&quot; consisting of Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic, while regarding Chadic and Omotic as the most remote branches;
*[[Vladimir Orel]] and [[Olga Stolbova]] (1995) group Berber with Semitic, Chadic with Egyptian, and split Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afro-Asiatic, seeing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a valid family;
*[[Alexander Militarev]] (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both, more distantly, with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic.

The '''Principality of Andorra''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Principat d'Andorra'', [[French language|French]]: ''Principauté d'Andorre'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Principado de Andorra'') is a small, [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[principality]] in south-western [[Europe]], located in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountains and bordered by [[France]] and [[Spain]]. Once isolated, it is currently a prosperous country mainly because of [[tourism]] and its status as a [[tax haven]].  Andorra is not to be confused with the [[Andora|Comune di Andora]].

== Origin and history of the name ==

The name &quot;Andorra&quot; probably originates from a [[Navarre|Navarrese]] word ''andurrial'', which translates as ''shrub-covered land''.

== History ==
{{main|History of Andorra}}

Tradition holds that [[Charlemagne]] granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the [[Moors]]. Overlordship of the territory passed to the local [[count of Urgell]] and eventually to the [[bishop]] of the [[diocese]] of Urgell. In the [[11th century]] a dispute arose between the bishop and his northern French neighbour over Andorra.

In 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a [[parage]], which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the French [[count of Foix]] (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the bishop of [[La Seu d'Urgell]], in  [[Catalonia]]. This gave the small [[principality]] its territory and political form.

Over the years the title passed to the kings of [[Navarre]].  After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] of France, he issued an edict (1607) that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra.

In the period 1812–13, the French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four departments. Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of Puigcerdà (département of Sègre).

In 1933 France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On [[July 12]], [[1934]], an adventurer named [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgel, declaring himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of Urgel. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on [[July 20]] and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco's Spain.
The Franco troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war.

During the [[Second World War]], Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and Spain.

In 1958 Andorra declared peace with [[Germany]], having been forgotten on the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that ended the [[First World War]] and remaining legally at war.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France and Spain. In recent times, however, its thriving [[tourism|tourist]] industry along with developments in transportation and communications have removed the country from its isolation and its political system was thoroughly modernized in 1993, the year in which it finally became a member of the United Nations.

== Politics ==
{{main articles|[[Politics of Andorra]] and [[Constitution of Andorra]]}}
{{seealso|List of Co-Princes of Andorra}}

Until very recently, Andorra's political system had no clear division of powers into [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] branches. Ratified and approved in 1993, the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] establishes Andorra as a sovereign parliamentary democracy that retains the co-princes as [[head of state|heads of state]], but the [[head of government]] retains executive power. The two co-princes serve coequally with limited powers that do not include veto over government acts. They are represented in Andorra by a delegate.

The way in which the two [[prince]]s are chosen makes Andorra one of the most politically distinct nations on earth. One co-Prince is the man or woman who is currently serving as [[President of France]], currently [[Jacques Chirac]] (it has historically been any Head of State of France, including Kings and Emperors of France). The other is the current [[Catholic]] [[bishop]] of the [[Catalan]] city of [[La Seu d'Urgell]], currently [[Joan Enric Vives i Sicilia]]. As neither prince lives in Andorra their role is almost entirely ceremonial.

Andorra's main legislative body is the [[unicameral]] [[General Council of the Valleys]] (''Consell General de les Valls''), a [[parliament]] of 28 seats; members are elected by direct popular vote, 14 from a single national constituency and 14 to represent each of the 7 parishes, with members serving four-year terms. The Andorran government is formed by the General Council electing the [[Head of Government]] (''Cap de Govern''), who then appoints ministers to the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], the Executive Council (''Govern''). Currently, government is held by the [[Liberal Party of Andorra]], with [[Albert Pintat]] as [[Prime Minister]]. The [[Social Democratic Party (Andorra)|Social Democratic Party]] is in opposition.

Defense of the country is the responsibility of [[France]] and [[Spain]].

== Administrative divisions ==
[[Image:Andorra.geohive.gif|thumb|right|300px|Map of Andorra.]]
{{main|Parishes of Andorra}}

Andorra consists of seven communities, known as ''parròquies'' (singular ''parròquia'' ''[[English Language|Engl.]]:'' parish)
*[[Andorra la Vella]]
*[[Canillo]]
*[[Encamp]]
*[[Escaldes-Engordany]]
*[[La Massana]]
*[[Ordino]]
*[[Sant Julià de Lòria]]

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Andorra}}

Befitting its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains of an average height of 1,996 m with the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at 2,946 m. These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Valira]] river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of 870 m).

Andorra's [[climate]] is similar to its neighbours' [[temperate climate]], but its higher altitude means there is on average more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Andorra}}

[[Image:AndorraLaVella.jpg|left|190px|Andorra La Vella]]
[[Tourism]], the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter [[resort]]s. Andorra's comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining [[France]] and [[Spain]] have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower [[tariff]]s.

The [[banking]] sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy. [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] production is limited&amp;mdash;only 2% of the land is arable&amp;mdash;and most [[food]] has to be [[import]]ed. The principal livestock activity is [[domestic sheep]] raising. [[Manufacturing]] output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.

Andorra is not a full member of the [[European Union]], but enjoys a special relationship with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacks a [[currency]] of its own and uses that of its two surrounding nations. Prior to 1999 these were the [[French franc]] and the Spanish [[peseta]], which have since been replaced by a single currency, the [[euro]]. Unlike other small European states that use the euro, Andorra does not yet mint its own [[euro coins]]; in October 2004, negotiations between Andorra and the [[European Union|EU]] began on an agreement which would allow Andorra to mint its own coins. Andorra’s [[natural resource]]s include [[hydropower]], [[mineral water]], [[timber]], [[iron ore]], and [[lead]].

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Andorra}}
{{seealso|List of Andorrans}}

Andorrans constitute a minority in their own country; only 33% of inhabitants hold Andorran nationality. The largest group of foreign nationals is that of [[Spain|Spaniards]] (43%), with [[Portugal|Portuguese]] (11%) and [[France|French]] (7%) nationals the other main groups. The remaining 6% belong to several other nationalities.

The only official language is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], the language of the nearby Spanish [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous region]] of [[Catalonia]], with which Andorra shares many cultural traits, though [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]] and [[French language|French]] are also commonly spoken. The predominant religion is [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Andorra}}
{{seealso|Music of Andorra}}

Andorra's long [[history]] has provided it with a rich [[mythology]] and an abundance of [[Fable|folk tales]], with roots originating in as far as [[Andalusia]] in the south and [[Netherlands]] in the north.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], the '''arithmetic [[mean]]''' of a set of numbers is the sum of all the members of the set divided by the number of items in the set (cardinality). (The word ''set'' is used perhaps somewhat loosely; for example, the number 3.8 could occur more than once in such a &quot;set&quot;.) If one particular number occurs more times than others in the set, it is called a mode. The arithmetic mean is what pupils are taught very early to call the &quot;[[average]].&quot; If the set is a [[statistical population]], then we speak of the '''population mean'''. If the set is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]], we call the resulting [[statistic]] a '''sample mean'''.

When the mean is not an accurate estimate of the median, the set of numbers, or [[frequency distribution]], is said to be [[skewness|skewed]].

The symbol &amp;mu; (Greek: mu) is used to denote the arithmetic mean of a population.

If we denote a set of data by ''X'' = { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}, then the sample mean is typically denoted with a horizontal bar over the variable (''x̅'', generally enunciated &quot;''x'' bar&quot;).

In practice, the difference between &amp;mu; and ''x̅'' is that &amp;mu; is typically unobservable because one observes only a sample rather than the whole population, and if the sample is drawn randomly, then one may treat ''x̅'', but not &amp;mu;, as a [[random variable]], attributing a [[probability distribution]] to it.

Both are computed in the same way:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mean} = \bar{x} = (x_1+\cdots+x_n)/n.&lt;/math&gt;

The arithmetic mean is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s. For instance, reporting the &quot;average&quot; [[net worth]] in [[Redmond, Washington]] as the arithmetic mean of all annual net worths would yield a surprisingly high number because of [[Bill Gates]]. These distortions occur when the mean is different from the median, and the median is a superior alternative when that happens.

In certain situations, the arithmetic mean is the wrong concept of &quot;average&quot; altogether. For example, if a stock rose 10% in the first year, 30% in the second year and fell 10% in the third year, then it would be incorrect to report its &quot;average&quot; increase per year over this three year period as the arithmetic mean (10% + 30% + (&amp;minus;10%))/3 = 10%; the correct average in this case is the [[geometric mean]] which yields an average increase per year of only 8.8%.

If ''X'' is a [[random variable]], then the [[expected value]] of ''X'' can be seen as the long-term arithmetic mean that occurs on repeated measurements of ''X''. This is the content of the [[law of large numbers]]. As a result, the sample mean is used to estimate unknown expected values.

Note that several other &quot;means&quot; have been defined, including the [[generalized mean]], the [[generalised f-mean|generalized f-mean]], the [[harmonic mean]], the [[arithmetic-geometric mean]], and the [[weighted mean]].

==Alternate notations==
The arithmetic mean may also be expressed using the sum notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>briefly mention the NFC</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AmericanFootballConference.png|right|American Football Conference]]
The '''American Football Conference''' ('''AFC''') is one of the two conferences of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The AFC was created after the league [[AFL-NFL Merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in early 1970. The NFL's [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] agreed to join the new AFC along with the 10 former AFL teams. All of the other NFL teams formed the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC). Initially, this alignment proved to be very unpopular with fans in these cities.

The AFC logo, shown to the right, is a variation of the old AFL logo [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AmericanFootballLeague.jpg as seen here]. Introduced in 1970 alongside the beginning of the new AFC, the logo has basically remained unchanged since its introduction, though the &quot;A&quot; wasn't as bold when it was first introduced.

The AFC currently consists of 16 teams, organized into four divisions (North, South, East, and West) of four teams each. Each team plays the other teams in their division twice (home and away) during the regular season in addition to 10 other games/teams assigned to their schedule by the NFL the previous May.  Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the team's final record in the previous season.  The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions.  This assignment shifts each year.  For instance, in the [[2006 NFL season|2006 regular season]], each team in the [[AFC East]] will play a game apiece against each team in both the [[AFC South]] and the [[NFC North]].  In this way division competition consists of common opponents, with the exception of the 2 games assigned on the strength of each team's prior season record. The NFC operates according to the same system.

At the end of each football [[season (sport)|season]], there are [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] games involving the top six teams in the AFC (the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining non-division-champion teams (&quot;[[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]]&quot;) by record). The last two teams remaining play in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship game]] with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC champion plays the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] champion in the [[Super Bowl]].

'''Albert Arnold Gore, Jr.''' (born [[March 31]], [[1948]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and businessman, who served as the 45th [[Vice President of the United States]] from [[1993]] to [[2001]].  

He [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|ran for President in 2000]] following [[Bill Clinton]]'s two four-year terms. He was defeated in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]] vote by the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidate [[George W. Bush]] on a vote of 271-266 with a Gore committed Elector from [[Washington, DC]] abstaining. However, Gore did receive more individual votes than Bush. The election was bitterly contested, including multiple recounts and a [[Bush v. Gore|5-4 Supreme Court]] decision that effectively secured the election for President [[George W. Bush]]. 

Gore currently serves as President of the American television channel [[Current TV|Current]] and Chairman of [[Generation Investment Management]], sits on the board of directors of [[Apple Computer]], and serves as an unofficial advisor to [[Google]]'s senior management.
Although speculation about a possible [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|presidential run in 2008]] still continues, he has stated that he does not currently plan to return to politics, but doesn't rule this possibility out in the future.

==Early life==
He attended the [[Sheridan school|Sheridan School]], and later the elite [[St. Albans School]]. In 1965, Gore enrolled at [[Harvard College]], where he majored in government. His roommates (in [[Dunster House]]) were actor [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and former Columbia University women's basketball star Katie Day's father, Bart Day. Gore graduated from Harvard in June 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. 

:For more information on Gore's academic records, see [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;amp;contentId=A37397-2000Mar18]

==Family==
Al Gore was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], to [[Albert Gore, Sr.|Albert A. Gore, Sr.]], a politician, and [[Pauline LaFon Gore]], one of the first female lawyers to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School.  Since his [[father]] was a veteran Democratic senator from Tennessee, Al Gore, Jr. divided his childhood between Washington, D.C., and [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]], [[Tennessee]].  
During the school year, the younger Gore lived in a [[hotel]] in Washington, during summer vacations, he lived in Carthage, where he worked on the Gore family farm.

In 1970, Gore married Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson ([[Tipper Gore]]), whom he had first met many years before at his high school senior [[prom]] (St. Albans School in Washington, D.C.). They have four children: [[Karenna Gore|Karenna]] (born [[August 6]], [[1973]]), married to [[Drew Schiff]]; [[Kristin Gore|Kristin]] (born [[June 5]], [[1977]]); [[Sarah Gore|Sarah]] (born [[January 7]], [[1979]]); and [[Al Gore III|Al III]] (born [[October 19]], [[1982]]). The Gores also have two grandchildren: Wyatt (born [[July 4]], [[1999]]) and Anna Schiff.   

The Gores now reside in [[Nashville]], Tennessee, USA, and own a small farm near Carthage, Tennessee.  The family attends New Salem Missionary [[Baptist Church]] in Carthage. The Gores in late 2005 bought a condo at San Francisco's swanky St. Regis.

==Soldier and journalist==
[[Image:AlGoreVietnam.gif|right|thumb|200px|Gore served as a field reporter in Vietnam for four months.]]

Although opposed to the Vietnam War, on [[August 7]], [[1969]], Gore enlisted in the [[United States Army|army]] to participate in the [[Vietnam War]] effort.  After completing training as a military journalist, Gore shipped to [[Vietnam]] in early 1971, serving for four months before being given an honorable discharge.  The chronology of Gore's military service is as follows:
* '''August 1969''': Enlisted at the [[Newark, New Jersey]] recruiting office.  
* '''August to October 1969''': 8 weeks of basic training at [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]]
* '''Late October 1969 to December 1970''': [[Fort Rucker]], [[Alabama]], on-the-job occupational training at the [[Army Flier]] newspaper.
* '''January 1971 to May 1971''': field reporter in [[Vietnam]], part of the 20th Engineer Brigade, stationed primarily at [[Bien Hoa]] Air Base near [[Saigon]].
* '''[[May 24]], [[1971]]''': Given an honorable discharge, after his early discharge request was granted.

Gore stated many times that he opposed the Vietnam War, but chose to enlist anyway.  Some observers have noted that Gore could have avoided Vietnam in a number of ways.  Gore considered all these options, but said that his sense of civic duty compelled him to serve. [[Alexander Cockburn]] and [[Jeffrey St. Clair]] suggest in ''[[Al Gore: A User's Manual]]'' that Gore joined the military for political gain.

Because Gore served as a journalist, he was never exposed to front-line combat. Although some allege that his famous father's influence helped him to obtain this position, most military analysts agree that any man who enlisted with a Harvard degree had a good chance of being assigned a support specialty rather than an infantry position (even at the war's height, 88% of all servicemen were assigned to noncombatant specialties). However, Gore's decision to enlist for a two year term did mean that he would not be able to select his assignment, a choice which was available to three year enlistees. According to [[Newsweek]] journalist [[Bill Turque]]'s [[biography]] ''[[Inventing Al Gore]]'' (which does not shy away from criticism and scandals, such as charging Gore with smoking [[marijuana]] far more frequently than he admits), 
:''Dess Stokes, staff sergeant at the Newark Armed Forces Entrance and Examination Station on the day he walked in, doesn't remember any communication from superiors about Gore. A kid with Gore's background (a 134 [[IQ]] and a Harvard degree), he said, didn't need to be a senator's son with high-level contacts to get the military job he wanted''. 

Gore's father, [[Al Gore Sr.]], lost the [[U.S. Senate election, 1970|1970 election]], and was no longer a Senator by the time Gore arrived in Vietnam, but was a Senator until January 1971 which included the time his son would have received his assignment. Some critics charge that his father's stature led Gore's superiors to give him less dangerous assignments than they might otherwise have given him. According to combat photographer [[H. Alan Leo]], Gore was protected from dangerous situations at the request of Brigadier General [[Kenneth B. Cooper]], the 20th Engineer Brigades Commander.  Leo stated that Gore's trips into the field were safe, and that Gore &quot;could have worn a tuxedo.&quot;  These remarks seem to contradict Gore's many public statements; 

:&quot;I carried an M-16. I pulled my turn on the perimeter at night and walked through the elephant grass and I was fired upon.&quot;(''[[Baltimore Sun]]'')
:&quot;I took my turn regularly on the perimeter in these little firebases out in the boonies. Something would move, we'd fire first and ask questions later.&quot; (''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'')
:&quot;I was shot at. I spent most of my time in the field.&quot; (''[[Washington Post]]'')
:&quot;I used to fly these things (combat helicopters) with the doors open, sitting on the ledge with our feet hanging down. If you flew low and fast, they wouldn't have as much time to shoot you.&quot;(''[[Weekly Standard]]'') 

For his part, Gore has stated that he knew Leo but rarely traveled with him in Vietnam, and that he never felt that he was being given special protection.  On the other hand, Leo's testimony is that Cooper gave the orders before Gore arrived, so Gore would not know about them.  The question of whether Leo frequently traveled with Gore or not still has not been conclusively answered.

Turque's book, however, states that 
:''[Cooper] said that he has no recollection of even meeting Leo, much less discussing Gore's safety with him. ...''
:''The evidence indicates that if there was an official effort to guarantee Gore's safety, it was uneven at best. His clippings from the Castle Courier, the newspaper of the U.S. Army Engineering Command, and other publications suggest that he pulled his weight, which in his case meant choppering around to report features about the good works of the 20th Engineers... When Smith said he was scheduled to leave for R&amp;amp;R in Hawaii, the sergeant called for volunteers. Gore stepped up and spent a cold night in a foxhole. &quot;Al did what everybody else did,&quot; said Mike O'Hara, the photographer who shot the Khe Sanh assignment...''
:''Regulations allowed for early release of personnel to teach or attend school if their services were deemed &quot;not essential to the mission,&quot; and Gore certainly qualified. ''

Gore stated in 1988 that his experience in Vietnam
:''didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did not take into account the fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for''.

After returning from Vietnam, Gore spent five years as a [[Journalist|reporter]] for the ''Tennessean'', a newspaper headquartered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  During this time, Gore also attended [[Vanderbilt University| Vanderbilt]] Divinity School and Law School, although he did not complete a degree at either.

==Congress==
[[Image:GoreSenate.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Al Gore speaks during a [[congressional hearing]] in the 1980s.]]
In the spring of 1976, Gore quit law school to run for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]], in [[United States House of Representatives, Tennessee District 4|Tennessee's fourth district]].  Gore defeated [[Stanley Rogers]] in the Democratic primary, then ran unopposed and was elected to his first [[Congress of the United States|Congressional]] post.  He was re-elected three times, in [[U.S. House election, 1978|1978]], [[U.S. House election, 1980|1980]], and [[U.S. House election, 1982|1982]].  In [[U.S. Senate election, 1984|1984]] Gore did not run for the House; instead he successfully ran for a seat in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], which had been vacated by Republican Majority Leader [[Howard Baker]].  Gore served as a Senator from Tennessee until 1993, when he became Vice President.

===House of Representatives===
On [[March 19]], [[1979]], Gore became the first person to appear on [[C-SPAN]], making a speech in the House chambers.

===Senate===

===1988 Presidential Run===
In 1988, Gore ran for President but failed to obtain the Democratic nomination, which went instead to [[Michael Dukakis]].

===Son's Accident and effect on 1992 Presidential run===
On [[April 3]], [[1989]], Gore's six-year-old son [[Al Gore III|Albert]] was nearly killed in an automobile accident while leaving the [[Baltimore Orioles]] opening game. Because of this and the resulting lengthy healing process, his father chose to stay near him during the recovery instead of laying the foundation for a presidential primary campaign against eventual nominee Bill Clinton. Gore started writing ''[[Earth in the Balance]]'', his book on environmental conservation, during his son's recovery.  ''Earth in the Balance'' became the first book written by a sitting senator to make ''[[The New York Times]]'' best-seller list since [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ''[[Profiles in Courage]]''.

===Congressional Committees===
While in Congress, Gore was a member of the following committees: [[U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] (Defense Industry and Technology Projection Forces and Regional Defense; [[Strategic Forces and Nuclear Deterrence]]); [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Commerce, Science and Transportation]] (Communications; Consumer; Science, Technology and Space- chairman 1992; [[Surface Transportatio]]n; [[National Ocean Policy]] Study); [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Printing|Joint Committee on Printing]]; [[U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]]; [[U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|Rules and Administration]].

==Vice Presidency==
[[Image:ClintonGore2.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Vice President talking with President Clinton as the two pass through the Colonnade at the White House.]]
[[Bill Clinton]] chose Gore to be his running mate on [[July 9]], [[1992]], to the surprise of many as the two were both young and were from the same region of the nation.  After winning the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 election]], Al Gore was inaugurated as the 45th Vice President of the United States on [[January 20]], [[1993]]. Clinton and Gore were re-elected to a second term in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 election]].

During his time as Vice President, Al Gore was mostly a behind the scenes player.  However, many experts consider him to be one of the most active and influential Vice Presidents in U.S. history. This was evident as Gore had weekly lunches with Clinton to keep each other abreast of current developments, although he later said that it was he who insisted on having those weekly lunches in the first place.

===Debate with Perot===
In 1993 Gore debated [[Ross Perot]] on [[CNN]]'s [[Larry King Live]] on the issue of [[free trade]]. Public opinion polls taken after the debate showed that a majority of Americans agreed with his point of view and supported [[NAFTA]]. Some claim that this performance may have been responsible for the passing of NAFTA in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where it passed 234-200. [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/reinventing_government.html]

===Initatives===
One of Gore's major accomplishments as Vice President was the ''National Performance Review'', which pointed out waste, fraud, and other abuse in the federal government and stressed the need for cutting the size of the [[bureaucracy]] and the number of regulations.  His book later helped guide President Clinton when he down sized the [[federal government]]. [http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/speeches/interego.html]  

====Internet Education====
As Vice President, Gore instituted a federal program calling for all schools and libraries to be wired to the [[Internet]]. This was a culmination of work that he had started several years before. While serving in the Senate, Gore had introduced legislation which called for the creation of a new federal research center for educational computing to support an &quot;information systems highway&quot;. [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/technology.html]

====Environment====
During Gore's tenure as Vice President, he was a strong proponent for environmental protection. While a senator working on his book ''Earth in the Balance'', Gore had traveled around the world on numerous fact-finding  missions. On [[Earth Day]] 1994, Gore launched the worldwide [[GLOBE program]], an innovative hands-on, school-based education and science activity that made extensive use of the Internet to increase student awareness of their environment and contribute research data for scientists.

The opinions he developed on issues such as global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the destruction of rain forests is said to have played a major role in policy making for the Clinton administration. In the late nineties, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the [[Kyoto Treaty]], which called for reduction in green house emissions. [http://web.archive.org/web/20001207090900/www.algore.com/speeches/speeches_kyoto_120897.html], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/environment.html]

====Foreign Policy====
Because of President Clinton's inexperience and Gore's service in Vietnam and in the Senate, Clinton would often look to Gore for advice in the area of foreign policy.  Gore was one of the first to call for action to remove Yugoslav President [[Slobodan Milošević]] from power in 1998.  Gore also supported [[Operation Desert Fox]], a three day bombing campaign against Iraq that attempted to &quot;degrade Saddam Hussein's ability to make and to use weapons of mass destruction.&quot; [http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/desert_fox/], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/foreign_policy.html]

[[Image:Algoreyasser.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Vice President Al Gore works along side President Clinton in trying to negotiate a Middle East peace plan with Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]].]]

====Other====
During the Clinton/Gore administration, Americans enjoyed eight years of relative peace along with the longest economic expansion in history.  Democrats attributed this prosperity to the policies of the Clinton/Gore administration, and especially to the passage of the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]], for which Gore cast the [[U.S. Vice President's tie-breaking votes|tie-breaking vote]].  During his 2000 campaign for the presidency, Gore attributed several positive economic results to his and Clinton's policies [http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/initiatives/economy.html]  more than 22 million new jobs, highest homeownership in American history, Lowest unemployment in 30 years, Paid off $360 billion of the national debt, lowest poverty rate in 20 years, higher incomes at all levels, converted the largest budget deficit, up to that time, in American history to the largest surplus, lowest government spending in three decades, lowest federal income tax burden in 35 years, and more families own stock than ever before.  However Gore later placed a large share of the blame for his election loss on the economic downturn and NASDAQ crash of March 2000 in an interview with [[National Public Radio]]'s [[Bob Edwards]].

==2000 presidential election==
{{main articles|[[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 2000]]}}
[[Image:Goreconvention.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Al Gore and running-mate Joe Lieberman at the [[2000 Democratic National Convention]].]]
After two terms as Vice President, Gore ran for [[President of the United States|President]]. In the Democratic primaries, Gore faced an early challenge from [[Bill Bradley]]. Gore's nomination was never really in doubt and Bradley withdrew from the race in early March 2000 after failing to win any state primary or caucus. 

In August 2000, Gore surprised many when he selected United States Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] to be his vice-presidential running mate. Lieberman, who is a more conservative Democrat than Gore, had publicly blasted President Clinton for the [[Monica Lewinsky]] affair. Many pundits saw Gore's choice of Lieberman as another way of trying to distance himself from the scandal-prone Clinton White House. Lieberman was also the first Jewish nominee on a major party's national ticket.

During the entire campaign, Gore was neck-and-neck in the polls with [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Governor of Texas]] [[George W. Bush]].  On Election Day, the results were so close that the outcome of the race took over a month to resolve, highlighted by the premature declaration of a winner on election night, and an extremely close result in the state of [[Florida]]. On election night, news networks first called Florida for Gore, then Fox News decided to call it for Bush and all of the other news stations followed their decision.

The race was ultimately decided by a razor thin margin of only 537 popular votes in Florida, a state favored to have gone to Bush (as his brother served as Governor).  The 537 number was an astonishingly close margin out of some 105 million votes cast nationwide. Florida's 25 electoral votes were awarded to George W. Bush only after numerous court challenges. Al Gore publicly conceded the election after the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' voted 7 to 2 to declare the ongoing recount procedure unconstitutional because it feared that different standards would be used in different parts of the state, and 5 to 4 to ban recounts using other procedures.  [[Image:Gore_Debate.jpg|thumb|200px|Al Gore makes a point during a [[U.S. presidential debate|presidential debate]] during the 2000 election as George W. Bush looks on.]] Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but decided &quot;for the sake of our unity of the people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.&quot;  He had previously made a concession phone call to Bush the night of the election, but quickly retracted it after learning just how close the election was. Following the election, a subsequent recount conducted by various U.S. news media organizations indicated that Mr. Bush would have won using the partial recount method of 4 strongly Democratic areas advocated by Mr. Gore, but that Mr. Gore would have won given a full recount of the state. [http://www.bushwatch.com/gorebush.htm][http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/florida.ballots/stories/main.html].

The states that ultimately voted for Gore over Bush in the 2000 elections were New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico, California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota and Hawaii giving Gore 267 electoral votes to Bush's 271. One of Gore's electors cast a blank ballot, to protest what she called DC's &quot;colonial status&quot;, thus the candidate's final number of electoral votes was 266.

The Florida election has been closely scrutinized since the election. Critics have argued that the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush (Brother of George W. Bush) and the Secretary of State of Florida, Katherine Harris, did play a part in ensuring that the state was in the red column of the Republicans come election day. Several irregularities are thought to have favored Bush; others may have given Gore an edge. Irregularities favoring Bush included the notorious Palm Beach &quot;butterfly ballots&quot;, which were alleged to have produced an unexpectedly large number of votes for [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate [[Pat Buchanan]], and a purge of some 50,000 alleged felons from the Florida voting rolls that included some voters who were again eligible to vote under Florida law. Many Bush supporters, however, believed that an unfair advantage was given to Gore when all major news networks, early on, prematurely projected Gore as the winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes at 7:52 PM Eastern Time.  This happened before the polls closed in 10 Florida counties in the heavily Republican western panhandle which are in the Central Time Zone, and thus closed at 7 PM Central Time (8 PM Eastern).  Some have thought that this depressed the pro-Bush vote in that area. [http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/02/02/cnn.report/cnn.pdf] During the numerous recounts (which made the phrase &quot;hanging chads&quot; infamous in the American vocabulary), there were also allegations of both pro-Bush and pro-Gore tampering by low-level operatives in the controversial counties. [http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2000/11/26/230955.shtml] It is unclear what effect, if any, this may have had.  And while the Gore camp fought (with some success) to keep overseas absentee votes out in counties thought to be pro-Bush, Bush operatives similarly (albeit while drawing less attention to their efforts) prevented the counting of overseas absentee votes in strong Democratic counties.  Both sides contended that the votes were cast after Election Day, and since many of the envelopes did not have cancelled stamps, it was not clear when the votes were cast.  Reports later surfaced that many overseas voters attempted to vote only after learning of the closeness of the Florida vote.

Some commentators still see such irregularities, and the legal maneuvering around the recounts as casting doubt on the legitimacy of the vote; as a matter of law, however, the issue was settled, albeit controversially again, when the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] accepted Florida's electoral delegation, only after a challenge to the Florida electors was presented in the congressional chambers on [[January 6]], [[2001]] by members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]]. Member after member went up decrying the lack of a senator who would be willing to co-sponsor the challenge without any effect. They thus failed to bring the challenge to a debate.  

Concern about the possible disenfranchisement of voters in the Florida vote led to widespread calls for electoral reform in the United States, and ultimately to the passage of the [[Help America Vote Act]], which authorized the [[United States federal government]] to provide funds to the states to replace their mechanical voting equipment with [[electronic voting]] equipment. However, this has led to new controversies, because of the security weaknesses of the computer systems, the lack of paper-based methods of secure verification, and the necessity to rely on the trustworthiness of the manufacturers whose employees also count those votes.
Although Gore won the nationwide popular vote by more than 500,000 votes, he lost the election by five electoral votes (with one D.C. elector, pledged to Gore, casting a blank ballot to protest the District's lack of representation in Congress).

[[Image:Al Gore on Futurama.JPG|thumb|[[Recurring_characters_of_Futurama#Al_Gore|Al Gore]] on [[Futurama]].]]

Joe Lieberman later criticized Al Gore for adopting a populist theme during their 2000 campaign. Lieberman said he objected to Gore's &quot;people vs. the powerful&quot; message, believing it was not the best strategy for Democrats to use to recapture the White House.[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28519]

While running for president in 2000, Al Gore was used as a voice actor for the television show ''[[Futurama]]'' (for which his daughter, Kristin, was a writer). He played [[Recurring characters of Futurama#Al Gore|himself]] again in another episode after the campaign was over.

==Private citizen==
===Professor Gore===
[[Image:Goreharvard2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|left|Al Gore re-emerges in 2001 as a visiting professor with a [[beard]].]]
Following his election loss, Gore accepted visiting [[professor]]ships at [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism]], [[Middle Tennessee State University]], [[University of California Los Angeles]], and [[Fisk University]]. In late 2001, Al Gore became a Senior Advisor to [[Google|Google]] and Vice Chairman of [[Los Angeles]]-based financial firm [[Metropolitan West Financial LLC]].

===Blasting Bush===
On [[September 23]], 2002, Gore spoke in [[San Francisco]] to The [[Commonwealth Club]] and made a controversial speech blasting Bush on the Iraq war [http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002-09-23-gore_x.htm] Although he admitted Saddam was a potential danger saying: &quot;We know that [Saddam] has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power&quot;[http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-09gore-speech.html]  He also spoke against rushing to war with Iraq, advising caution and saying that Iraq was a diversion from fighting Al-Qaeda and terrorism in Afghanistan and elsewhere: &quot;I don't think that we should allow anything to diminish our focus on avenging the 3,000 Americans who were murdered and dismantling the network of terrorists who we know to be responsible for it. The fact that we don't know where they are should not cause us to focus instead on some other enemy whose location may be easier to identify.&quot;

Following the [[November 5]], [[2002]], midterm elections Gore re-emerged into the public eye with a 14-city book tour and a well-orchestrated &quot;full Gore&quot; media blitz which included a pair of policy speeches. On [[September 23]], Gore delivered a speech on the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|War with Iraq]] and the [[War on Terrorism]] that generated a fair amount of commentary. Less than two weeks later, on October 2, he made a speech on Bush's handling of the economy to the [[Brookings Institution]]. Also, during this time period Gore guest starred on several programs such as [[The Late Show with David Letterman]] and [[Saturday Night Live]] (with legendary rock band [[Phish]]), appearing much more relaxed and funnier as a private citizen than he did while holding public office.

[[Image:Goresnl.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Al Gore hosting ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' along side ''[[The West Wing (television)|West Wing]]'' stars [[Martin Sheen]] and [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]].]]
In 2003 Gore joined the board of directors of [[Apple Computer]].  On the political front, Gore kept his promise of staying involved in public debate when he offered his criticism and advice to the [[Bush Administration]] on key topics such as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Occupation of Iraq]], [[USA Patriot Act]], and [[natural environment|environmental]] issues, most notably [[global warming]].  Gore also continued to visit campuses across the nation lecturing on issues such as [[race]], [[media]], and [[democracy]].

On [[April 10]], [[2004]], Gore met with the [[9-11 Commission]] in private to give his testimony on what his administration did to prevent terror attacks. In a statement after the three-hour session, the commission said he was candid and forthcoming, and it thanked him for his &quot;continued cooperation.&quot;

In the summer of 2004, Gore teamed up with [[MoveOn.org]], to promote the new science fiction film, [[The Day After Tomorrow|''The Day After Tomorrow'']].  Although Gore said the movie was a far-fetched example of global warming, he said the movie would escalate public debate on the issue.

On [[April 27]], [[2005]], Gore gave an hour-long speech lambasting the GOP's effort to do away with the legislative [[filibuster]].  In response to Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]], who for weeks had repeated threats to impose the &quot;[[nuclear option]]&quot; if [[Senate]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] did not stop blocking judicial nominees via the filibuster, Gore said, &quot;Their grand design is an all-powerful executive using a weakened [[legislature]] to fashion a compliant judiciary in its own image. The Senate has confirmed 205 or over 95% of President Bush's nominees.  Democrats have held up only 10 nominees, less than 5%. Compare that with the 60 Clinton nominees who were blocked by Republican obstruction between 1995 and 2000.  What is involved here is a power grab,&quot; Gore said.  Gore also took aim at what he called &quot;religious zealots&quot; who claim special knowledge of [[god (monotheism)|God's]] will in [[American politics]].  He went on to say, &quot;They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith. How dare they!&quot;  This was Gore's first major policy speech of 2005 and also the first one since the defeat of Democratic hopeful John Kerry in late 2004.

In May 2005, Gore was awarded a lifetime achievement award for three decades of contributions to the Internet.  The [[Webby Awards]], which are widely hailed as the ''[[Oscars]]'' of the web, &quot;wanted to set the record straight&quot; about Al Gore and the Internet once and for all.   [[Tiffany Shlain]], the awards' founder and chairwoman said, &quot;It's just one of those instances someone did amazing work for three decades as congressman, senator and vice president and it got spun around into this political mess,&quot; Shlain said. [http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-05-04-gore-webby_x.htm]

In September 2005, Gore chartered two aircraft to evacuate 270 evacuees from New Orleans in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-katrina-gore,1,535141.story?coll=sns-ap-nation-headlines&amp;amp;ctrack=1&amp;amp;cset=true] He was highly critical of the government and federal response in the days after the hurricane.

===Future===
Speaking at an economic forum in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], in October 2005, Gore again stated that he has no intention of ever running for president again in response to questions from reporters.  However, Gore said he could not rule the possibility out completely saying, &quot;I do not completely rule out some future interest, but I do not expect to have that.&quot; When asked how the United States would have been different if he had become president, Gore stated, &quot;We would not have invaded a country that didn't attack us,&quot; he said, referring to Iraq. &quot;We would not have taken money from the working families and given it to the most wealthy families.&quot; &quot;We would not be trying to control and intimidate the news media. We would not be routinely torturing people,&quot; Gore said. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/12/politics/main938098.shtml]

In the past few years, Gore has remained busy traveling the world speaking and participating in events mainly aimed towards global warming awareness and prevention.

On January 2006, Al Gore delivered a major speech criticising President Bush's use of domestic wiretaps. Gore stated that Bush broke the law and recommended an independent counsel investigate the matter further. Also in January 2006, Al Gore was the leading man in the Sundance global warming documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. 

Al Gore will be publishing a second book on global warming titled &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; in April 2006. 

On February 12, 2006: Former US vice-president Al Gore on Sunday said that the US government had committed ‘terrible abuses’ against Arabs living in America after 9/11 attacks, and that most Americans did not support such treatment.

“The thoughtless way in which visas are now handled, that is a mistake,” Mr Gore said at the Jeddah Economic Forum. “The worst thing we can possibly do is to cut off the channels of friendship and mutual understanding between Saudi Arabia and the United States.”

The former US vice-president told this Saudi audience, many of them educated in US universities, that Arabs in the United States had been “indiscriminately rounded up, often on minor charges of overstaying a visa or not having a green card in proper order, and held in conditions that were just unforgivable.”

“Unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it’s wrong. I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country.”

Terrence Jeffrey of [[Human Events]] and [[Jack Kelly]] of [[RealClearPolitics.com]] however criticized Gore's comments, and pointed out that [[9/11 Commission]] (page 492) reported that [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], who planned the attacks, told interrogators most of the hijackers he selected were Saudis because they had the easiest time getting visas. [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-2_17_06_JKE.html] [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004544.htm] [[Mohammad Atta]] himself was in the United States, having overstayed his visa.

====Television network====
{{main|Current TV}}
[[Image:Current.png|right|thumb|200px|Al Gore's ''Current'' official logo.]]
On [[May 4]], [[2004]], [[INdTV]] Holdings, a company co-founded by Gore and [[Joel Hyatt]], purchased cable news channel [[NewsWorld International]] from [[Vivendi Universal]].  The new network will not have political leanings, Gore said, but will serve as an &quot;independent voice&quot; for a target audience of people between 18 and 34 &quot;who want to learn about the world in a voice they recognize and a view they recognize as their own.&quot; The network was relaunched under the name [[Current TV|Current]] on [[August 1]], [[2005]].

====Investment firm====
In late 2004, it was announced that Al Gore had launched and will chair an investment firm to seek out companies taking a responsible view on big global issues like [[climate change]].

Gore's group, [[Generation Investment Management]], was created to assist the growing demand for an investment style which can bring returns by blending traditional equity research with a focus on more intangible non-financial factors such as social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance.

==2004 presidential election==
===Endorsing Dean===
[[Image:AlGoreHowardDean.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Al Gore shocked many when he did not endorse his 2000 running mate Joe Lieberman, but the outsider candidate, Howard Dean, in 2003.]]
Initially, Al Gore was touted as a logical opponent of George W. Bush in the [[2004 United States Presidential Election]]. &lt;!-- &quot;Re-elect Gore!&quot; was a common slogan among many Democrats who felt the former Vice President had been unfairly cheated out of the presidency, on the grounds that he had won the popular vote and (in the opinion of many){{fact}} should have won the Electoral College vote. --&gt;  On [[December 16]], [[2002]] however, Gore announced that he would not run in 2004, saying that it was time for &quot;fresh faces&quot; and &quot;new ideas&quot; to emerge from the Democrats. When he appeared on a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview, Gore said that he felt if he had run, the focus of the election would be the rematch rather than the issues. Gore's former running mate, Joe Lieberman quickly announced his own candidacy for the presidency, which he had vowed he would not do if Gore ran.

Despite Gore taking himself out of the race, a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to &quot;[[political draft|draft]]&quot; him into running.  However, that effort largely came to an end when Gore publicly endorsed [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont Governor]] [[Howard Dean]] (over his former running mate [[Joe Lieberman]]) weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. There was still some effort to encourage write-in votes for Gore in the primaries by a different group of Gore supporters who were separate from the draft movement. Although Gore did receive a small number of votes in New Hampshire and New Mexico, that effort was halted when [[John Kerry]] pulled into the lead for the nomination. Gore's endorsement of Dean was helpful to the latter in legitimizing him in the eyes of the establishment faction of the Democratic Party, but it also led the media to dub Dean as the clear front-runner, with the result that his opponents devoted more of their emphasis to opposing him.

===Campaigning against Bush===
On [[January 15]], [[2004]], Al Gore gave a major policy address in [[New York City]] on [[climate change]] and the Bush administration's approach to the environment.  Accompanied by slides and projector, Gore slammed the Bush administration's attitude towards global warming saying, &quot;There are many who still do not believe that global warming is a problem at all. And it's no wonder: because they are the targets of a massive and well-organized campaign of disinformation lavishly funded by polluters who are determined to prevent any action to reduce the [[greenhouse gas]] [[emissions]] that cause global warming, out of a fear that their profits might be affected if they had to stop dumping so much pollution into the atmosphere.&quot;

On [[February 9]], [[2004]], on the eve of the [[Tennessee]] primary, Gore gave what many consider his harshest criticism of the president yet when he accused [[George W. Bush]] of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. &quot;He betrayed this country!&quot; Mr. Gore shouted into the microphone.  &quot;He played on our fears! He took America on an ill-conceived foreign adventure dangerous to our troops, an adventure preordained and planned before 9/11 ever took place!&quot;  Gore also urged all Democrats to unite behind their eventual nominee proclaiming, &quot;Any one of these candidates is far better than George W. Bush.&quot;  In [[March 2004]] Gore, along with former Presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Jimmy Carter]], united behind Kerry as the presumptive Democratic nominee.

[[Image:AlGoreSpeaking2004.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Al Gore, who just four years prior accepted his party's nomination, speaks as a party elder at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.]]

On [[April 28]], [[2004]], Gore announced that he would be donating $6 million to various Democratic Party groups.  Drawing from his funds left over from his [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]], Gore pledged to donate $4 million to the [[Democratic National Committee]]. The party's Senate and House committees would each get $1 million, and the party from Gore's home state of [[Tennessee]] would receive $250,000. In addition, Gore announced that all of the surplus funds in his &quot;Recount Fund&quot; from the 2000 election controversy that resulted in the Supreme Court halting the counting of the ballots, a total of $240,000, will be donated to the [[Florida]] Democratic Party.

In his speech, Gore stressed the importance of voting and having every vote counted, a point that foreshadowed the [[2004 U.S. election voting controversies]].

On [[May 26]], [[2004]], Gore gave a highly critical speech on the Iraq crisis and the [[Bush Administration]].  In the speech, Gore demanded [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[George Tenet]], [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[Undersecretary of Defense for Policy]] [[Douglas Feith]], and [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]] [[Stephen Cambone]] all resign for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of Americans abroad.  During the fiery speech, which lasted more than an hour, Gore called the Bush administration's Iraq war plan &quot;incompetent&quot; and called George W. Bush the most dishonest president since [[Richard Nixon]], who resigned the office of the presidency in 1974 following the [[Watergate]] scandal. 

Gore also decried the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse|abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq]], saying, &quot;What happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples. It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy.&quot;

====Convention====
As the first major speaker at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]], Gore held himself out as a living reminder that every vote counts.  &quot;Let's make sure not only that the Supreme Court does not pick the next president, but also that this president is not the one who picks the next Supreme Court,&quot; said Gore.  Gore directed remarks to supporters of third-party presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]], who abandoned the Democratic Party four years ago, asking them, &quot;Do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?&quot;

====Post-Convention====
On [[October 18]], 2004, Al Gore delivered his final major policy speech of the 2004 political season.  In an hour long presentation, Gore concluded that, &quot;I'm convinced that most of the president's frequent departures from fact-based analysis have much more to do with right-wing political and economic [[ideology]] than with the [[Bible]].&quot;

==Views and controversies==
{{main|Al Gore controversies}}
Gore is a strong supporter of [[abortion]] rights, [[free trade]], and strong [[environmentalism|environmental]] policy. He was a vocal opponent of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] [http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-09gore-speech.html].
Gore has gradually moved politically further [[Left-wing politics | left]]; he was once a moderate-to-conservative lawmaker. While in Congress, Gore had a strong pro-life record on abortion and voted pro-life 27 times. When exactly Gore became pro-choice is unknown, but by 1988, when he sought the Democratic presidential nomination, he was on record as opposing the criminalization of abortion.

Critics have charged Gore with [[1996 U.S. campaign finance scandal|illegal fundraising]] at a Buddhist temple and illegal use of his government office and telephone for political fundraising in violation of the Hatch Act, although he was never indicted on such a charge.

===The Internet===
Gore is a frequent target of satire, based on his supposedly having claimed to have invented the Internet. In fact he never made such a claim [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp]. Rather, during an interview with [[Wolf Blitzer]] on [[CNN]]'s &quot;Late Edition&quot; on March 9, 1999, Gore stated:

: During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/03/09/president.2000/transcript.gore].

The phrase from the statement above which sparked the debate, &quot;I took the initiative in creating the Internet,&quot; referred to Gore's involvement with and  sponsorship of the ''High Performance Computing Act of 1991'' which advanced the growth and mainstreaming of the Internet during the [[1990s]] [http://www.mit.edu/afs/net.mit.edu/dev/mit/jis/OldFiles/nrenbill.txt]. 

This statement was later defended by Internet pioneers [[Bob Kahn|Robert Kahn]] and [[Vinton Cerf]] [http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200009/msg00052.html]:

: ...as the two people who designed the basic architecture and the core protocols that make the Internet work, we would like to acknowledge VP Gore's contributions as a Congressman, Senator and as Vice President.  No other elected official, to our knowledge, has made a greater contribution over a longer period of time.

===Accusations of hypocrisy by McClellan and Gonzales===
On the 16th of January, 2006, Gore accused U.S. [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] of &quot;breaking the law repeatedly and insistently,&quot; and called for a special investigation of [[NSA]] spying on Americans because the spying was without a warrant from a special federal court that authorizes such requests to eavesdrop on Americans.

Bush press secretary [[Scott McClellan]] and Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]] both responded to reporters that the Clinton-Gore administration had done illegal warrantless physical searches themselves of [[Aldrich Ames]] without permission from a judge. 

&quot;I think his hypocrisy knows no bounds,&quot; McClellan said of Gore. But the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] at the time did not cover physical searches. The law had changed in 1995. Gore claimed that because Gonzales made a &quot;political defense&quot; for Bush, he was no longer eligible to review charges against Bush and therefore must name a [[special counsel]]. 

&quot;His charges are factually wrong,&quot; said Gore, &quot;Both before and after the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] was amended in 1995; the Clinton-Gore administration complied fully and completely with the terms of the law.&quot; [http://www.forbes.com/business/manufacturing/feeds/ap/2006/01/17/ap2456266.html]

'''Animal Farm''' is a [[satire|satirical]] [[novel]] (which can also be understood as a modern [[fable]] or [[allegory]]) by [[George Orwell]], ostensibly about a group of animals who oust the humans from the [[farm]] they live on and run it themselves, only to have it corrupted into a brutal tyranny on its own. It was written during [[World War II]] and published in 1945, although it was not widely successful until the late [[1950s]].

''Animal Farm'' is a thinly veiled critique and satire of Soviet [[totalitarianism]]. Many events in the book are based on events from the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Stalin]] era.  Orwell, though a leftist — he was for many years a member of the [[Independent Labour Party]] — was a critic of Stalin, and suspicious of Moscow-directed communism after his experiences in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
When the farm's prize-winning pig, [[Old Major]], calls a meeting of all the animals of Manor Farm, he tells them that he has had a dream in which mankind is gone, and animals are free to live in peace and harmony. He compares the humans to parasites, and then proceeds to teach the animals a [[revolution]]ary song, &quot;[[Beasts of England]]&quot;. The other animals begin to hope and dream for the revolution of such a day. When Old Major dies, a mere three days later, three pigs -- [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] (who teaches the animals to read), [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], and [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] -- assume command, and turn his dream into a full-fledged philosophy. One night, the starved animals suddenly revolt and drive the farmer [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]], his wife, and his pet raven off the farm and take control. The farm is renamed &quot;Animal Farm&quot; as the animals work towards a future [[utopia]]. The [[Seven Commandments]] of the new philosophy of [[Animalism]] are written on the wall of a barn for all to read, the seventh and most important of which is that &quot;all animals are equal&quot;. All animals work, but the [[horse|workhorse]] [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] does more than his fair share and adopts a [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] of his own — &quot;I will work harder.&quot;

Animal Farm is off to a great start. Snowball teaches the other animals to [[reading (activity)|read]] and write (though few animals besides the pigs learn to read well), food is plentiful due to a good harvest, and the entire Farm is organized and running smoothly. Even when Mr. Jones tries his last-ditch effort to retake control of the farm, the animals easily defeat him at what they later call the &quot;[[Battle of the Cowshed]]&quot;. Soon, however, things begin to unravel as Napoleon and Snowball begin an epic power struggle over the farm. When Snowball announces his idea for a [[windmill]], Napoleon quickly opposes it. A meeting is held, and when Snowball makes his passionate and articulate speech in favour of the windmill, Napoleon only makes a brief retort and then makes a strange noise to call in nine attack dogs. They burst in and chase Snowball off of the farm. In his absence, Napoleon declares himself the leader of the farm and makes instant changes. He announces that meetings will no longer be held as before, and a committee of pigs alone will decide what happens with the farm.

Napoleon changes his mind about the windmill, claiming (through Squealer) that Snowball stole the idea from him, and the animals begin to work. After a violent [[storm]], the animals wake to find the fruit of their months of labour utterly annihilated. Though neighbouring [[farmer]]s scoff at the thin walls, Napoleon and Squealer convince everyone that Snowball destroyed it. Napoleon begins to purge the farm, killing many animals he accuses of consorting with Snowball. In the meantime, Boxer takes a second [[mantra]], &quot;Napoleon is always right.&quot; 

Napoleon begins to abuse his powers even more and life on the farm becomes harder and harder for the rest of the animals. The pigs impose more and more controls on them while reserving [[privilege]]s for themselves. History is rewritten to villainise Snowball and glorify Napoleon even further. Each step of this development is justified by the pig, Squealer, who on several occasions alters the Seven Commandments on the barn in the dead of night. The song &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned as inappropriate now that the dream of Animal Farm has been realised, and is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon who begins to live more and more like a human. The animals, though cold, starving, and overworked, remain convinced that they are still better off than when they were ruled by a man named Jones.

[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr. Frederick]], one of the two neighbouring farmers, swindles Napoleon by paying with forged banknotes, and then attacks the farm and uses [[dynamite]] to blow up the recently restored windmill. Though the animals of Animal Farm eventually win the battle, they do so at a great cost, as many of the animals, including Boxer, are wounded. However, Boxer continues to work harder and harder, until he finally collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to come and take Boxer to the veterinarian, but as Boxer is loaded up and the van drives away, the animals read what is written on the side of the van: &quot;Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler.&quot; Squealer quickly reports that the van with the old writing has been purchased by the hospital, and later that Boxer has died in the hospital, in spite of the best medical care. 

Many years pass, and the pigs learn to walk upright, carry [[whip]]s, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single phrase: &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot; Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs, and the humans of the area (in the adjacent Foxwood Farm run by Mr. [[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Pilkington]]). He announces his alliance with the humans against the labouring classes of both &quot;worlds&quot;.

The animals discover this when they overhear Napoleon's conversations and finally realize that a change has come over the ruling pigs. During a poker match, an argument breaks out between Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington when they both play an [[Ace of Spades]], and the animals realise how they cannot tell the difference between the pigs and the humans.

The pigs walked on two feet and they adopted many of Mr. Jones' customs and principles. The pigs have violated every one of the rules set out in the beginning which they set up. This is when we come to the theme of this book: power corrupts.

==Plot references to real events==
*The ousting of the Humans after the farmers forget to feed the animals – [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] led to the removal of the Tsars after a series of famine and poverty.
*The refusal of the Humans to refer to Animal Farm by its new name (still calling it Manor Farm) may be indicative of the diplomatic limbo in which the Soviets existed following their early history. 
*Mr. Jones' last ditch effort to re-take the farm (The Battle of the Cowshed) – [[Russian Civil War]] in which the western capitalist governments sent soldiers to try to remove the Bolsheviks from power.
*Napoleon's removal of Snowball – [[Stalin]]’s removal of [[Leon Trotsky]] from power in 1927 and his subsequent expulsion.
*Napoleon stealing Snowball’s idea for a windmill – Stalin later shifted away from &quot;[[World revolution|World Socialism]]&quot; to &quot;[[Socialism in one country]]&quot; which Trotsky had originally promoted. The windmill can also be considered a symbol of the Soviet [[Five-Year Plan|Five-Year Plans]], a concept developed by Trotsky and adopted by Stalin, who claimed them to be his idea.
*Moses the raven leaving the farm for a while and then returning — Similar to the Russian Orthodox Church going underground and then being brought back to give the workers hope.
*Boxer's motto, &quot;Napoleon is always right&quot; is strikingly similar to &quot;Mussolini is always right&quot; a chant used to hail [[Benito Mussolini]] during his rule of [[Italy]] from 1922 to 1943.
*During the rise of Napoleon, he ordered the collection of all the hens' eggs. In an act of defiance, the Hens destroyed their eggs rather than give them to Napoleon — During Stalin's [[collectivization]] period in the early 1930s, many Ukrainian peasants burned their crops and farms rather than handing them over to the government.
*Napoleon's mass executions, of which many were unfair for the alleged crimes — [[Stalin]] executed his political enemies for various crimes after they were tortured and forced to falsely confess.
*The four pigs that go against Napoleon's will represent the [[White movement]].
*Napoleon's replacement of the farm anthem &quot;[[Beasts of England]]&quot; with an inane composition by the pig poet Minimus (&quot;Animal Farm, Animal Farm / Never through me / Will you come to harm&quot;) – In 1943, Stalin replaced the old national anthem &quot;[[the Internationale]]&quot; with &quot;the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union|Hymn of the Soviet Union]].&quot; The old internationale glorified the revolution and &quot;the people.&quot; The original version of the Hymn of the Soviet Union glorified Stalin so heavily that after his death in 1953, entire sections of the anthem had to be replaced or removed. Orwell could have also been referring to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s banning of the French national hymn, [[La Marseillaise]] in 1799.
*Napoleon's dealing with Mr. Frederick, who eventually betrays Animal Farm and destroys the windmill. Though Animal Farm repels the human attack, many animals are wounded and killed — Stalin’s [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, which was later betrayed in 1941 when [[Operation Barbarossa|Hitler invaded the Soviet Union]]. Though the Soviet Union won the war, it came at a tremendous price of roughly 8.5-15 million Soviet soldiers (unconfirmed) and many civilians, coming to an incredible estimated 20 million dead, as well as the utter destruction of the Western Soviet Union and its prized collective farms which Stalin had created in the 1930s.
*Napoleon's later alliance with the humans — Stalin’s non-aggression pact with Hitler in the early years of WWII.
*Napoleon's changing Animal Farm back to Manor — The [[Red Army]]’s name was changed from the &quot;Workers' and Peasants' Red Army&quot; to the &quot;Soviet Army&quot; to appear as a more appealing and professional organization rather than an army of the common people. 
*After Old Major dies, his skull is placed on display on a tree stump. Similarly, [[Vladmir Lenin|Lenin's]] (whom Old Major is based on along with Karl Marx) embalmed body was put on display in [[Lenin's mausoleum|Lenin's Tomb]] in [[Red Square]] postmortem, where it still remains.
*Squealer, constantly changing the commandments, is said to be a reference to a perversion in Russian religious history, as observed by [[Leo Tolstoy]] when the essential precepts of the [[Sermon on the Mount]] were altered by [[Russian Orthodox]] Church. It may also refer to the revision of history texts to glorify Stalin during his regime.

== Characters ==
The events and characters in Animal Farm are all carefully drawn to represent the history of the Soviet Union; Orwell makes this explicit in the case of Napoleon, whom he directly connects to Stalin in a letter of [[17 March]] [[1945]] to the publisher. 

:..when the windmill is blown up, I wrote 'all the animals including Napoleon flung themselves on their faces'.  I would like to alter it to 'all the animals except Napoleon'.  If that has been printed it's not worth bothering about, but I just thought the alteration would be fair to JS [Joseph Stalin], as he did stay in Moscow during the German advance.

The other characters have their analogies in the real world, but care should be taken with these comparisons as they do not always match history exactly and often simply represent generalised concepts.

===The pigs===
*[[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]] — The pig who becomes the leader of Animal Farm post-Rebellion. Created based on the actions of [[Joseph Stalin]], he uses his military (of nine attack dogs) to cement his power through fear. Napoleon craftily drives out his opponent, Snowball.
*[[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] — The pig who fights Napoleon for control post-Rebellion. Inspired by [[Leon Trotsky]], Snowball is a passionate intellectual and is far more honest about his motives than Napoleon. Snowball easily wins the loyalty of most of the animals. Trotsky was driven into exile in Mexico where he was assassinated.
*[[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] — The pig who serves as public speaker. Inspired by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and the Russian paper [[Pravda]], Squealer twists and abuses the language to excuse, justify and extol Napoleon's actions, no matter how egregious. All his life, George Orwell made it a point to show how politicians used language. Squealer limits the debate by complicating it, and he confuses and disorients, making claims that the pigs need the extra luxury they are taking in order to function properly. To squeal is to betray, something Squealer does often to his fellow animals.
*Minimus — A poet pig who writes a song about Napoleon, representing admirers of Stalin both inside and outside the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] such as [[Maxim Gorky]].
*[[Old Major (Animal Farm)|Old Major]] — As a fellow socialist, Orwell agreed with some of [[Karl Marx]]'s politics, and even respected [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In fact, the satire in Animal Farm is not of Marxism, or Lenin's revolution, but of the corruption that occurred later. Major, who is based upon both Lenin and Marx, is the inspiration which fuels the rest of the book. Though it is a positive image, Orwell does slip some flaws in Old Major, such as how during his complaints about the abuse of animals he admits that he has been largely free from those terrors.
*Pinkeye — A small piglet who tastes Napoleon's food for poisoning.
*Piglets — While not truly noted in the novel, these piglets are hinted to be the children of Napoleon, and are the first generation of animals to actually be subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.

===The humans===
*[[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] — The original owner of Manor Farm. He is probably based on [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]].
*[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr. Frederick]] — The tough owner of Pinchfield, a well-kept neighbouring farm. He is probably based on [[Germany]] and/or [[Adolf Hitler]].
*[[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr. Pilkington]] — The easy-going but crafty owner of Foxwood, a neighbouring farm. He represents [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and/or [[Winston Churchill]].
*Mr. Whymper — A human whom Napoleon hires to represent Animal Farm in human society. He is loosely based on [[George Bernard Shaw]] who visited the USSR in 1931 and praised what he found.

===The other animals===
*[[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] — Possibly one of the more popular characters, Boxer is the tragic avatar of the working class, or [[proletariat]]: loyal, dedicated, and strong. His major flaw, however, is his blind trust of the leaders and his inability to see corruption. He is used and abused by the pigs as much or more than he was by Jones. His death serves to show just how far the pigs are willing to go. A strong and loyal [[draft horse]], Boxer played a huge part in keeping the Farm together prior to his death. Boxer could also represent a [[Stakhanovite]]. His name is a reference to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] 
*Clover — Boxer's close friend, and also a draft horse. She blames herself for forgetting the original [[Seven Commandments]] when Squealer revises them. She represents the middle class educated people who acquiesce to the subversion of principles by the powerful.
*Mollie — A horse who likes wearing ribbons (which represent luxury) and being pampered by humans. She represents upper-class people, the [[Bourgeoisie]] who fled from the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R]] after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].
*Benjamin — A [[donkey]] who is cynical about the revolution. He is said to be inspired by Orwell himself. He represented the skeptical people in and out of Russia who believed that [[communism]] would not help the people of Russia
*Moses — A tame [[raven]] who spreads stories of Sugarcandy Mountain, the &quot;animal heaven&quot;. These beliefs are denounced by the pigs. Moses represents religion (specifically the Russian Orthodox Church), which has always been in conflict with [[communism]]. It is interesting to note that, while Moses initially leaves the farm after the rebellion, he later returns and is supported by the pigs. This represents the cynical use of religion by the state to anaesthetise the minds of the masses.  
*Muriel — A [[goat]] who reads the edited commandments. She may represent intelligent labour.
*Jessie and Bluebell — Two dogs who give birth in Chapter III. Their puppies are nurtured by Napoleon to inspire fear, without doubt representing the formation of the [[NKVD]]/[[KGB]].
*The Hens — Represent the [[Kulaks]], landed [[peasants]] persecuted by [[Stalin]]. 
*The Dogs — Napoleon's secret police and bodyguards (inspired by Cheka, NKVD, OGPU, MVD)
*The Sheep — The sheep show the dumb, animal following of the proletariats in the midst of the Russian Civil War (“Four legs good, two legs bad!”).

== Significance==
The book is an [[allegory]] about the events following the revolution in the [[Soviet Union]], and in particular the rise of [[Stalinism]] and the betrayal of the revolution which basically replaced one dictatorship for another. 

Orwell wrote the book following his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]] which are described in another of his books, ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.  He intended it to be a strong condemnation of what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original [[socialism|socialist]] ideals, in which he believed and continued to believe after he saw a revolution betrayed, as in Spain.  For the preface of a Ukrainian edition he prepared in 1947, Orwell describes what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays/ukrainian-af-pref.htm Preface to the Ukrainian Edition of Animal Farm]&lt;/ref&gt;.

:..I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge cart-horse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.

This Ukrainian edition was an early propaganda use of the book.  It was printed to be distributed among the soviet citizens of Ukraine who were just some of the many millions of [[displaced persons]] throughout Europe at the end of the Second World War.  The American occupation forces did not appreciate these illegal presses, printing propaganda, and confiscated 1,500 copies of ''Animal Farm'', handing them to the Soviet authorities.  The politics in the book also affected Britain, with Orwell reporting that [[Ernest Bevin]] was &quot;terrified&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Letter to [[Herbert Read]], [[18 August]], [[1945]].&lt;/ref&gt; that it may cause embarrassment if published before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]].

In recent years the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt and undemocratic government or organization, only to become corrupt and oppressive themselves over time as they succumb to the trappings of power and begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it. Such analogies have been used for many former African colonies such as [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], whose succeeding African-born rulers were thought to be as corrupt as the European colonists they supplanted.

In schools Animal Farm is used in the [[Core Knowledge]] curriculum. Core knowledge is based on the interaction of different subjects in schools. The way Animal Farm comes into play is that if a student's Geography or History Class is learning about the former Soviet Union, the English class will be reading Animal Farm.

==Post-publication views of the book==
In the post-[[World War Two|War]] years it became apparent to Orwell that anti-Russian literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch — including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. One publisher he sought to sell his book to rejected it on the grounds of government advice — although it was later found that the civil servant who gave the order was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell: The Life'', D.J. Taylor, 2003, ISBN 0-8050-7473-2)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Orwell originally prepared a preface on freedom of the press for the book which noted &quot;The sinister fact about literary [[censorship]] in England is that it is largely voluntary. ... [Things are] kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that ‘it wouldn’t do’ to mention that particular fact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orwell.ru/library/novels/Animal_Farm/english/efp_go The Freedom of the Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat [[irony|ironically]], the preface itself was censored and is not published with most copies of the book.

==Film versions==
The book was the basis of an animated feature [[film]] in 1955 (Britain's first full-length animated movie), directed by [[John Halas]] and [[Joy Batchelor]] and quietly commissioned by the American [[CIA]], which softened the theme of the story slightly by reducing the role of Moses, the character representing religion, and adding an epilogue, that occurs immediately after the novel's iconic concluding imagery is depicted, where the other animals successfully revolt against the pigs.

There was also a 1999 live action film directed by John Stephenson, with voices by [[Kelsey Grammer]] as Snowball, [[Patrick Stewart]] as Napoleon, and [[Ian Holm]] as Squealer. Despite a few differences (such as completely different songs and Jesse being the first to question the pigs), much of the plot is loyal to the book. The film diverges from the book with an additional epilogue in which Jesse and several animals escape and return years later to a post-Napoleon era Animal Farm. 

==Cultural references==
* [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[1977]] [[record album|album]] ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]'' was partially inspired by Animal Farm. It categorises people as pigs, dogs, or sheep.
* In an episode of ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' (&quot;Aunt Katie's Farm&quot;), Johnny, while dressed in a pig costume, goes crazy and yells, &quot;Four legs good! Two legs bad!&quot; over and over.
* Radical socialist rappers [[Dead Prez]] released a song called &quot;Animal in Man&quot; off their debut LP, ''[[Let's Get Free]]'', re-telling the story.
* A song off canadian band [[Protest the Hero]]'s debut CD [[A Calculated Use of Sound]], called &quot;Red Stars Over the Battle of the Cowshed&quot; is presumably a reference to Animal Farm

'''Amphibians''' ([[Class (biology)|class]] '''Amphibia''') are a [[taxon]] of [[animal]]s that include all [[tetrapod]]s (four-legged [[vertebrate]]s) that do not have [[amniotic sac|amniotic]] eggs. Amphibians (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''αμφις'' &quot;both&quot; and ''βιος'' &quot;life&quot;) generally spend part of their time on land, but they do not have the adaptations to an entirely terrestrial existence found in most other modern tetrapods ([[amniote]]s). There are about 5,950 described, living [[species]] of amphibians. The study of amphibians and [[reptile]]s is known as [[herpetology]]. 

== History of amphibians ==
[[Image:Salamandra salamandra CZ.JPG|thumb|226px|right|[[Fire Salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'')]]Amphibians developed with the characteristics of pharyngeal slits/[[gills]], a [[dorsal nerve cord]], a [[notochord]], and a post-anal tail at different stages of their life. They have persisted since the dawn of tetrapods 390 million years ago in the [[Devonian]] period, when they were the first four-legged animals to develop [[lung]]s. During the following [[Carboniferous]] period they also developed the ability to walk on land to avoid aquatic competition and [[predation]] while allowing them to travel from water source to water source. As a group they maintained the status of the dominant animal for nearly 75 million years. Throughout their history they have ranged in size from the 3 foot (90cm) long Devonian [[Ichthyostega]], to the slightly larger 5 foot (150cm) long [[Permian]] [[Eryops]], and down to the tiny ''[[Brachycephalus didactylus]]'' (Brazilian Gold Frog) and ''[[Eleutherodactylus iberia]]'' from [[Cuba]], with a total length of 9.6-9.8 millimeters (0.4 inches). Amphibians have mastered almost every climate on earth from the hottest deserts to the frozen arctic.

== Classification ==
[[Image:Caecilian.jpg|226px|thumb|right|[[Caecilian]] from the [[San Antonio]] zoo]]
Traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all [[tetrapod]]s that are not [[amniote]]s.  Recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these, called the [[Lissamphibia]].  Recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class Amphibia to the Lissamphibia, i.e. to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.

There are two [[ancient]], [[extinct]], [[Subclass (biology)|subclasses]]:

* Subclass [[Labyrinthodontia]] ([[paraphyletic]])
* Subclass [[Lepospondyli]]

Of the remaining modern subclass '''Lissamphibia''' there are three [[Order (biology)|order]]s:

* Order [[Anura]] ([[frog]]s and [[toad]]s) (in Superorder Salientia): 5,228 species
* Order [[Caudata]] or [[Urodela]] ([[salamander]]s): 552 species
* Order [[Gymnophiona]] or [[Apoda]] ([[caecilian]]s): 171 species

Authorities disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. In effect Salientia includes all the Anura plus a single [[Triassic]] proto-frog species, ''[[Triadobatrachus massinoti]]''.  Practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now.

== Reproduction ==
For the purpose of [[reproduction]] most amphibians are bound to [[fresh water]]. A few tolerate [[brackish water]], but there are no true [[sea water]] amphibians. Several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations (e.g., [[Eleutherodactylus]], the Pacific Platymantines, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water whatsoever. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and [[evolution]]ary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet [[tropical rainforest]]s and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, bypassing the [[tadpole]] stage entirely. Several species have also adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, but most of them still need water to lay their eggs. [[Symbiosis]] with single celled [[algae]] that lives in the jelly-like layer of the eggs has evolved several times. The larvae (tadpoles or polliwogs) breathe with exterior [[gill]]s. After hatching, they start to transform gradually into the adult's appearance. This process is called [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. Typically, the animals then leave the water and become terrestrial adults, but there are many interesting exceptions to this general way of reproduction.

The most obvious part of the amphibian metamorphosis is the formation of four legs in order to support the body on land. But there are several other changes:
* The gills are replaced by other [[Respiratory system|respiratory organ]]s, i.e. [[lung]]s.
* The skin changes and develops [[gland]]s to avoid [[dehydration]]
* The eyes get eyelids and adapt to vision outside the water
* An [[eardrum]] is developed to lock the middle [[ear]]
* In frogs and toads, the [[tail]] disappears

==Amphibian conservation==
{{main|decline in frog populations}}
[[Image:Bufo periglenes1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Golden toad]] of [[Monteverde]], [[Costa Rica]] was among the first casualties of amphibian declines. Formerly abundant, it was last seen in 1989.]]
Dramatic declines in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized [[extinction]], have been noted in the past two decades from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived as one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]]. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including [[habitat destruction]] and modification, over-exploitation, [[pollution]], [[introduced species]], [[climate change]], and disease.  However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and amphibian declines are currently a topic of much ongoing research.

'''Alaska''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ə 'læ skə]}}) is the 49th [[U.S. state|state]] of the [[United States]]. It was admitted on [[January 3]], [[1959]]. The population of the state is 626,932, [[as of 2000]], according to the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. census]]. Alaska is most likely ranked the fourth smallest state population wise in the U.S. with Wyoming, Vermont, and by now North Dakota smaller than Alaska. The name &quot;Alaska&quot; is most likely derived from the [[Aleut]] word ''Alyeska'', meaning ''greater land'' as opposed to the Aleut word ''Aleutia,'' meaning ''lesser land''. To the Aleuts, this distinction was a linguistic variation distinguishing the ''mainland'' from an ''island''.

It is bordered by [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] and [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] to the east, the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south, the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Strait]], and [[Chukchi Sea]] to the west, and the [[Beaufort Sea]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north. Alaska is the largest state by area in the United States. It is larger in area than all but 18 of the world's nations.

==History==
{{main|History of Alaska}}

Alaska was first inhabited by humans who came across the [[Bering Land Bridge]]. Eventually, Alaska became populated by the [[Inupiaq]], [[Inuit]] and [[Yupik]] [[Eskimo]]s, [[Aleut]]s, and a variety of [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] groups. Most, if not all, of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas probably took this route and continued further south and east.

The first written accounts indicate that [[Russian colonization of the Americas|the first Europeans to reach Alaska came from Russia]]. [[Vitus Bering]] sailed east and saw [[Mount Saint Eli
