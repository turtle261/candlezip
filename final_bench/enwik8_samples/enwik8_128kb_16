d one-third are appointed by the president for five years, of whom half must be women.

The judicial system of Afghanistan consists of the ''[[Stera Mahkama]]'' (Supreme Court), appeals courts, and lower district courts designated by law. The ''Stera Mahkama'' is made up of nine judges appointed by the president, with the approval of parliament, to a ten-year term. Judges must be at least forty years of age, not belong to a political party, and have a degree in law or Islamic jurisprudence. The ''Stera Mahkama'' can judge the constitutionality of all laws in the country.

==Culture==
''Main article: [[Culture of Afghanistan]]''

Afghans display pride in their country, ancestry, military prowess, and above all, their independence. Like other highlanders, Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their clan loyalty and for their readiness to carry and use arms to settle disputes. (Heathcote, 2003). As clan warfare / internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreign invaders to hold the region.

Afghanistan has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of the country's historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The two famous statues of [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Buddha]] in the [[Bamiyan Province]] were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. Other famous sites include the very cities of [[Herat]], [[Ghazni]] and [[Balkh]]. The [[Minaret of Jam]], in the [[Hari Rud]] valley, is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].

The people of Afghanistan are prominent horsemen as the national [[sport]] is [[Buzkashi]]. [[Afghan hound]]s (a type of running [[dog]]s) also originated in Afghanistan.

Although literacy levels are very low, classic Persian poetry plays a very important role in Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in both Iran and Afghanistan, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Private poetry competition events known as “musha’era” are quite common even among ordinary people. Almost every home owns one or more poetry collection of some sort, even if it is not read often.

The Afghan dialect of the Persian language [[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] derives from &quot;Farsi-e Darbari&quot;, meaning 'Persian of the royal courts'. It is regarded by some scholars as the more original version of the language. Iran, having a larger population, a stronger economy and closer ties to the rest of the world has developed its language further in the course of history. Afghanistan took a more conservative approach mainly due to lack of resources. As a result, Dari has not changed much over the last few centuries.

Many of the famous Persian language poets of 10th to 15th centuries stem from what is now known as Afghanistan. They were mostly also scholars in many disciplines like languages, natural sciences, medicine, religion and astronomy. Examples are Mawlvi Balkhi ([[Rumi]]), born and educated in the Balkh province in the 13th century and moved to today’s Istanbul, [[Sanaayi]] Ghaznavi (12th century, native of Ghazni provice), [[Jami]] Heravi (15th century, native of Jam-e-Herat in western Afghanistan), [[Alisher Navoi|Nizam ud-Din Ali Sher Heravi Nava'i,]] (15th century, Heart province). Also, some of the contemporary Persian language poets and writers, who are relatively well-know in both Iran and Afghanistan includes [[Ustad Behtab]], [[Khalilullah Khalili]] [http://www.afghanmagazine.com/arts/khalili/khalili.html], Sufi Ghulam Nabi Ashqari [http://www.afghanmagazine.com/jan2000/music/kharaabat/], [[Parwin Pazwak]] and others.

In addition to poets, the region of Afghanistan produced numerous scientists as well including [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina Balkhi) who hailed from [[Balkh]]. Avicenna, who travelled to [[Isfahan]] later in life to establish a medical school there, is known by some scholars as &quot;the father of modern medicine&quot;. George Sarton called Ibn Sina &quot;the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times.&quot; His most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'' and ''The Canon of Medicine'', also known as the Qanun. Avicenna's story even found way to the contemporary English literature through Noah Gordon's The Physician [http://www.noahgordonbooks.com/index.html], now published in many languages.

Before the Taliban gained power, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern Afghan music, especially during the [[Nauroz]]-celebration. Kabul in the middle part of the 20th century has been likened to [[Vienna]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. 

The tribal system, which orders the life of most people outside metropolitan areas, is certainly as potent in political terms as the national state system of Europe 1914. Men feel a fierce loyalty to their own tribe, such that, if called upon, assemble in arms under the tribal chiefs and local clan leaders (Khans) in the same way that men throughout Europe &quot;flocked to the colours&quot; in 1914, forming up in regional divisions and battalions under the command of the local nobility and gentry. In theory, under Islamic law, every believer has an obligation to bear arms at the ruler's call ([[Ulul-Amr]]), but this was no more needed than was enforced conscription to fill the ranks of the British Army in 1914. The Afghan shepherd or peasant went to war for much the same mixture of reasons as the more &quot;civilised&quot; European clerk or factory worker - a desire for adventure, a desire not to be left out or lose esteem in the eyes of his fellows, a contempt for invading foreigners, revenge against those that ruined his family life or threatened his faith, perhaps even the chance of extra cash or enhanced personal prospects.

The tribal system is not something particularly backward or warlike. It is simply the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that has an uncomplicated lifestyle - from a materialistic point of view (Heathcote, 2003).

==Education==
''Main article: [[Education in Afghanistan]]''

In the spring of 2003, it was estimated that 30% of Afghanistan's 7,000 schools had been seriously damaged during more than two decades of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation and civil war. Only half of the schools were reported to have clean water, while fewer than an estimated 40% had adequate sanitation. Education for boys was not a priority during the [[Taliban]] regime, and girls were banished from schools outright.

In regards to the poverty and violence of their surroundings, a study in 2002 by the [[Save the Children]] aid group said Afghan children were resilient and courageous. The study credited the strong institutions of family and community.

Up to four million Afghan children, possibly the largest number ever, are believed to have enrolled for class for the school year beginning in March of 2003. Education is available for both girls and boys.

Literacy of the entire population is estimated at 36%, Male Literacy rate is 51% and female literacy is 21%. The male literacy rate is higher because previous Taliban laws prohibited the education of women.

Higher Education - The American University of Afghanistan

Another aspect of education that is rapidly changing in Afghanistan is the face of Higher Education. In 2006 the American University of Afghanistan [http://www.auaf.edu.af] opens it's doors, with support from USAID [http://usinfo.state.gov/sa/Archive/2005/Apr/06-83303.html] and other donors. With the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan, the university will take students from Afghanistan and the region.

''This article is about Albania, the country on the Adriatic coast of the Balkans.  For other historic uses, see [[Albania (disambiguation)]]. 

'''Albania''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Republika e Shqipërisë'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[ɾɛpublika ɛ ʃciəpəɾisə]}}) is a [[Mediterranean]] country in southeastern [[Europe]]. It is bordered by [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in the north, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the east, and [[Greece]] in the south; it has a coast on the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the west, and a coast on the [[Ionian Sea]] in the southwest. The country is an emerging [[democracy]] and is formally named the '''Republic of Albania'''.

== History ==
''Main articles: [[Illyria]], [[Illyricum]], [[Dalmatia]], [[History of Albania]].''

The earlier inhabitants were probably part of the pre-Indo-European populace that occupied the coastline of most parts of the Mediterranean. Their physical remains are scarce though, and concentrated on the coastal region. Soon, these first inhabitants were overrun by the Proto-Hellenic tribes that gradually occupied modern-day Greece, southern parts of what is now the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the south of present-day Albania. This process was completed over the second millennium BC and did not really affect northern or central Albania, an area that at the time presented the image of a political vacuum (in essence a historical paradox).

Historians do not agree over the origin of the [[Illyrians]]. Some of them maintain that the Illyrians descended from the pre-Indo-European [[Pelasgians]], while most scholars place them in the later wave of Indo-European invasions. Their presence can be traced back to 900 BC, when their political structure was formulated in the [[7th century BC|7th]] and [[6th century BC|6th]] centuries BC. Excellent metal craftsmen and fierce warriors, the Illyrians formed warlord based kingdoms that fought amongst themselves for most of their history. Only during the 6th century did the Illyrians venture significant raids against their immediate neighbours: the kingdom of the [[Molossians]] in southern Albania, the kingdom of [[Macedon]], and the kingdom of [[Paionia]].

Besides warfare, the [[Illyrians]] were also peaceful traders of agricultural products and metal works. The [[Illyrian]] culture was heavily influenced by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture (mainly the south Illyrian tribes). Albania is also the site of several ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colonies.

=== Macedonian Rule ===
Probably their most important success was the slaughter of [[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]], king of Macedon. Unfortunately for the [[Illyrians]], [[Perdiccas]] was succeeded by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], father of [[Alexander the Great]], who effectively terminated the [[Illyrian]] aggression, effectively ending any dominant control by the [[Illyrians]] in the region.

=== Roman and Byzantine Rule ===
After being conquered by the [[Roman Empire]], [[Illyria]] was reorganized as a [[Roman]] province, [[Illyricum]], later divided into the provinces of [[Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]], the lands comprising Albania mostly being included in [[Dalmatia]]. Later, the [[Byzantine Empire]] governed the region. It was also ruled by the [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbian Empire]]. After centuries, use of the name ''Illyria'' to denote the region fell out of fashion.

=== Ottoman Rule ===
In the middle ages, the name ''Albania'' (see ''[[Origin and history of the name Albania]]'') began to be increasingly applied to the region now comprising the nation of Albania. From [[1443]] to [[1468]] [[Skanderbeg|Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu]] led a successful resistance against the invading [[Ottomans]]. After the death of [[Skenderbeg]], resistance continued until [[1478]], although with only moderate success. The loyalties and alliances created and nurtured by [[Skenderbeg]] faltered and fell apart, and the [[Ottomans]] conquered the territory of Albania shortly after the fall of the [[castle]] [[Kruje]]. '''Albania''' then became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Following this, many Albanians fled to neighboring [[Italy]], and the majority of the '''Albanian''' population that remained converted to [[Islam]]. They would remain a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until [[1912]].

=== Effects of the Balkan Wars ===
After the [[Balkan Wars|Second Balkan War]], the [[Ottomans]] were removed from Albania and there was a possibility of the lands being absorbed by [[Serbia]], and the southern tip by [[Greece]]. This decision angered the [[Italians]] who did not want [[Serbia]] to have an extended coastline, and it angered the [[German people|Germans]] who could build a railway to reach the Orient. [[Berlin]] then held discussions with [[Russia]] (the superpower in charge of [[Serbia]]) and with [[Greece]]. Eventually, it was decided that the country should not be divided but instead consolidated into the [[Principality]] of Albania under a German [[prince]],[[William of Wied]]. When the German [[prince]] was expelled by the [[Albanian]] people after 6 months as the self named &quot;King of Albania&quot;, [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and [[Italy]], as members the [[League of Nations]], wanted to divide the territory once and for all. Intervention by [[United States of America]] [[president]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] vetoed the vote and allowed Albania to retain its status. From [[1928]], the country was ruled by [[Zog of Albania|King Zog I]] until [[1938]] when it became a puppet of [[Italy]].

=== World War II and Enver Hoxha Rule ===
Albanian communists and nationalists actively fought a partisan war against the Italian and German invasions in WW II.  Certain smaller organizations helped the foreign invaders, but it was the [[communists]] who took over after [[World War II]]. In November [[1944]] the communists gained control of the government under the leader of the resistance, [[Enver Hoxha]] . From [[1945]] until [[1990]] Albania had one of the most repressive governments in [[Europe]]. The [[communist party]] was created in [[1941]] with the help of [[Bolshevik]] [[Communist]] Parties. All those who opposed it were eliminated.

For the many decades under his domination, Hoxha created and destroyed relationships with Belgrade, Moscow, and China, always in his personal interests. The country was isolated, first from the West (Western Europe, North America and Australasia) and later even from the communist East.

=== The Fall of Communism and Democratic Albania ===

In 1985, Enver Hoxha died and [[Ramiz Alia]] took his place. Initially, Alia tried to follow in Hoxha's footsteps, but in Eastern Europe changes had already started: [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had appeared in the [[Soviet Union]] with new policies ([[Glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]). The Albanian totalitarian regime was under pressure from the [[United States|US]], Europe, and the anger and despair of its own people. After [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] (the communist leader of [[Romania]]) was executed in a revolution, Alia knew he would be next if changes were not made. He signed the [[Helsinki Agreement]] (which was signed by other countries in 1975) that respected some [[human rights]]. He also allowed [[pluralism]], and even though his party won the election of 1991 it was clear that the change would not be stopped. In [[1992]] the general elections were won by the Democratic Party with 62% of the votes.

In the general elections of June, [[1996]] the Democratic Party tried to win an absolute majority and manipulated the results. In [[1997]] an epidemic of [[pyramid schemes]] sent shockwaves through the entire country's economy, and riots started. Police stations and military bases were looted of millions of weaponry, [[Kalashnikov]]s. Anarchy prevailed, and many cities were controlled by militia and less-organized armed citizens. Even US military advisors left the country for their own safety. In response to the anarchy, the Socialist Party won the early elections of [[1997]].

However, stability was far from being restored in the years after the 1997 riots. The power feuds raging inside the Socialist Party led to a series of short-lived Socialist governments. The country was flooded with refugees from neighboring [[Kosovo]] in [[1998]] and [[1999]]. In June, 2002, a compromise candidate, Alfred Moisiu, a former general and defense minister, was elected to succeed President Meidani. Parliamentary elections in July, [[2005]], brought back to power Sali Berisha, Leader of the Democratic Party, mostly owing to Socialist infighting and a series of corruption scandals plaguing the Nano government.

Since 1990 Albania has been diplomatically oriented towards the West, it was accepted to the Council of Europe and has requested membership of [[NATO]]. The work-force of Albania has continued to emigrate to Greece, Italy, Europe and North America. Corruption in the government is becoming more and more obvious. Any hope for a short and not too painful transition after Communism has long since been dashed.

== Politics ==
''Main article:'' [[Politics of Albania]]

The head of state is the president, who is elected by the ''[[Kuvendi]]'', or the Assembly of the Republic of Albania every 5 years. The main part of the Assembly's 140 members is elected every 4 years. 100 of the parliament's members are chosen by the people with a direct vote, while the other 40 members are chosen using a proportional system. The head of government is the Prime Minister who is assisted by a council of ministers.  The Council of Ministers is selected by the Prime Minister (A process called &quot;forming the government&quot;) and then approved by a simple majority (71 votes) in the Assembly.

== Administrative divisions ==
''Main articles: [[Districts of Albania]] and [[Counties of Albania]]''

Albania is divided into 12 ''qark'' (county or prefecture), which are further divided into 36 ''rrethe'' (districts).  The capital city, Tiranë, has a special status. The districts are:

== Geography ==
''Main article: [[Geography of Albania]]''

[[Image:Albania map.png|frame|Map of Albania]]

Albania consists of mostly [[hill]]y and [[mountain]]ous terrain, the highest mountain, Korab in the district of Dibra reaching up to 2,753 metres (9,032&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The country mostly has a continental [[climate]], with cold [[winter]]s and hot [[summer]]s.

Besides capital city [[Tirana]], with 800,000 inhabitants, the principal cities are [[Durrës]], [[Elbasan]], [[Shkodër]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Vlorë]] and [[Korçë]]. In Albanian grammar a word can have indefinite and definite forms, and this also applies to city names: so both Tiranë and Tirana, Shkodër and Shkodra are used.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Albania]]''

In Albania, half of the economically-active population still engaged in [[agriculture]] and a fifth works abroad.

The country has almost no exports, and imports most if its goods from Greece and Italy. Money for imports comes from financial aid and from the money that [[immigrant]]s working abroad - mostly in neighbouring Greece - bring to Albania. This is a good [[status quo]] business for both Greece and Italy. 

Albania's coastline on the Ionian Sea, near the Greek tourist island of [[Corfu]], is becoming increasingly popular with foreign visitors due to its relatively unspoilt nature and good beaches. However, the tourist industry is still in its infancy.

Growth was strong 2003-05 and inflation is not a problem.

GDP(purchasing power parity): 18.05 billion
Note: Albania has a large gray economy that may be as large as 50% of official GDP. (2005 est.)

GDP (official exchange rate): 8.741 billion (2005 est.)

GDP (real growth rate): 6% (2005 est.)  

GDP- composition by sector: 
agriculture: 23.6%
industry: 20.5%
services: 55.9%  (2005 est.)

Exports: 708 million f.o.b. (2005 est.)

Imports: 2.473 billion f.o.b. (2005 est.)

Aid per Capita:  52 US$ 

External Debt:  1.41 billion (2003 est.) 

Defence Expenditure:  (n/a)  

Children in Labour Force:  1 % of children aged 10-14 work

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Albania]]''

Most of the population is ethnically Albanian (95% according to the [[CIA World Factbook]] Feb 2005), there is a [[Greece|Greek]] minority (3% of the population), this however could significally vary according to other sources, (note: in 1989, other estimates of the Greek population ranged from 1% (official Albanian statistics) to 12% (from a Greek organization) [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/al.html#People]). Many ethnic Albanians also live in the bordering countries of [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (around 1,850,000; of that, around 1,800,000 in [[Serbia]] (around 1,700,000 in its province called [[Kosovo]] (officially [[Kosovo and Metohia]]) only) and around 50,000 in [[Montenegro]]) and the [[Republic of Macedonia]] (around 500,000) although a lot of Albanians believe that the number might be higher.  Also a small number of ethnic Albanians live in Greece which are called Çam.  Claims over Çam numbers have ranged from 90,000 to over one 1,000,000 but are believed to be understated because Athens has not considered the local Albanians to be a separate ethnic group.[http://www.frosina.org]  Since [[1991]], large numbers of Albanians have emigrated, both legally and illegally, to [[Greece]] and [[Italy]].

The language is [[Albanian language|Albanian]], although [[Greek language|Greek]] is also spoken by the Greek minority in the southern regions of the country.

At the height of the Ottoman occupation, the majority of [[Albanians]] were mostly [[Muslim]] (70%), even though religion was prohibited during the communist era. The Albanian government proclaimed Albania the only officially atheistic country in the world. After the fall of the Communist Regime in 1989-1990 religions were reinstated. According to 1939 statistics, the [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox]] (20%) and [[Roman Catholic Church]] (10%) would be the other main religions in Albania. Religious fanaticism has never been a serious problem, with people from different religions living in peace and even getting married although this was not considered to be an optimal solution.  20% of the total Muslim population is [[Bektashi]], people who follow a faith originating in the Turkish migrations into Turkey, and came to Albania through the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]. It has outwardly Shi'ite Islamic elements, but is really a Shamanic-Pantheistic faith.

:''For a king of [[Anglo-Saxon]] England, see [[Aella of Deira]] or [[Aelle II of Northumbria]]  or [[Aelle of Sussex]].''
:''Men's names &lt;u&gt;Allah-ed-din&lt;/u&gt; and similar are misspellings for [[Ala-ud-din]]; and see [[Arabic name#Mistakes made by Europeans and other non-Arabs|here]] for other sorts of error.''
The word '''{{ArabDIN|Allāh}}''' is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for &quot;[[God]]&quot;. In other languages, it is often used to refer specifically to the [[Islamic concept of God]]: see &quot;[[#Usage|Usage]]&quot; below.

==Etymology==
===Usage===
{{Arabicterm|الله|Allah, Allāh|The God}}
Although, outside the Arab world, use of the word ''Allāh'' is most often associated with [[Islam]], it is not exclusive to that faith; [[Arab Christians]] and various Arabic-speaking [[Jew]]s (including the [[Teimanim]], several {{ArabDIN|[[Mizrahi Jews|Mizraḥi]]}} communities and some [[Sephardim]]) also use it to refer to the [[monotheist]] [[deity]]. Arabic translations of the [[Bible]] also employ it, as do [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] in [[Malta]] (who pronounce it as &quot;Alla&quot;), [[Christians]] in [[Indonesia]], who say &quot;Allah Bapa&quot; (God the Father) and Christians in the [[Middle East]] who use the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] &quot;Allāha&quot;.

===&quot;Allah&quot; as a word===
Many [[Linguistics|linguists]] believe that the term ''Allāh'' is derived from a contraction of the Arabic words ''al'' (the) and ''ʾilāh'' (deity, masculine form) - ''al-ilāh'' meaning &quot;the god.&quot; In addition, one of the main pagan goddesses of pre-Islamic Arabia, [[Allat|Allāt]] (''al'' + ''ʾilāh'' + ''at'', or 'the goddess'), is cited as being [[Etymology|etymologically]] (though not synchronically) the feminine linguistic counterpart to the grammatically masculine Allāh. If so, the word ''Allāh'' is an abbreviated title, meaning 'the deity', rather than a name. For this reason, both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars often translate Allāh directly into [[English language|English]] as 'God'; this also explains why Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians freely refer to God as Allāh. However, some Muslim scholars feel that &quot;Allāh&quot; should not be translated, because they perceived the Arabic word to express the uniqueness of &quot;Allāh&quot; more accurately than the word &quot;god&quot;, which can take a plural &quot;gods&quot;, whereas the word &quot;Allāh&quot; has no plural form.  This is a significant issue in [[translation of the Qur'an]]. 
[[Image:Allah.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of ''{{ArabDIN|allāh}}'' written in simple [[Arabic calligraphy]].]] 

The word ''Allāh'' is always written without an [[alif]] to spell the ''ā'' vowel. This is because the spelling was settled before Arabic spelling started habitually using [[alif]] to spell ''ā''. However, in vocalized spelling, a diacritic ''alif'' is added on top of the ''[[shadda|shaddah]]'' to indicate pronunciation. One exception is in the pre-Islamic [[History of the Arabic alphabet#Pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions|Zabad inscription]], where it is spelled الاه.

[[Unicode]] has  glyph reserved for Allah,  {{ar|ﷲ}} = U+FDF2, which can be combined with an alif to yield the post-consonantal form, {{ar|اﷲ}}, as opposed to the full spelling ''alif-lām-lām-hā'' {{ar|الله}} which may be rendered slightly differently, in particular featuring a diacritic ''alif'' on top of the ''shadda''. In this, Unicode imitates traditional Arabic typesetting, which also frequently featured special ''llāh'' types.

Also In ''[[Abjad numerals]]'', [[The Name Of Allah (&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1607;) ]] numeric value is [[66]].

==Islamic use of &quot;Allāh&quot;== 
From the point of view of traditional [[Islam]]ic [[theology]], Allāh is the most precious name of God because it is not a descriptive name like other [[Ninety-nine names of Allah|ninety-nine names of God]], but the name of God's own presence.  Muslims believe that the name of Allah had existed before the time of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]. It is the same God worshipped by [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] and other [[prophets of Islam]]. In Islam, there is only one God and Muhammad is the last messenger.  

The emphasis in Islamic culture on reciting the [[Qur'an]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] has resulted in ''Allāh'' often being used by [[Muslim]]s world-wide as the word for ''God'', regardless of their [[native language]]. Out of 114 [[Sura]]s in the [[Qur'an]], 113 begin with the [[Basmala]] (&quot;Bismi 'llāhi 'r-rahmāni 'r-rahīm&quot; بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم) which means &quot;In the name of God, the most kind, the most merciful&quot;. 
[[Muslim]]s, when referring to the name, often add the words &quot;Subhanahu wa Ta`ala&quot; after it, meaning &quot;Glorified and Exalted is He&quot; as a sign of reverence, or &quot;`Azza wa Jalla&quot; (عز و جل). The entire religion of [[Islam]] is based on the idea of getting closer to God. Although commonly referred to as a &quot;He&quot;, God is considered genderless, but there is no [[neuter gender]] to express this in the Arabic language. When Greek or other [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] deities are discussed in Arabic, it is customary to use the expression ''ilāh'', a &quot;deity&quot; or lower-case &quot;god&quot;; sometimes the word ''ma`būd'', literally meaning &quot;worshipped [entity]&quot;, is used instead.

===Uses of &quot;Allāh&quot; in phrases===
There are many [[List of Arabic phrases#Phrases with Allah's name|phrases]] that contain the word Allāh:
*[[Allahu Akbar|Allāhu Akbar]] (الله أكبر) (God is the greatest)
*[[A'uzu billahi minashaitanir rajim]] (I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the damned)
*[[Basmala|Bismi-llāh]] (بسم الله) (In the name of God)
*[[Insha'Allah|Inshā'Allāh]] (إن شاء الله) (God-willing)
:also the origin of the common [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[interjection]] &quot;Ojalá&quot;, which shares a similar meaning.
:probably also the origin of the [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] interjection ''Oxalá'', &quot;let's hope for it&quot; or &quot;let's hope that...&quot;.
*[[Yā Allāh]] (يا الله)(Oh God)
:may be the origin of the Spanish and Portuguese [[exclamation]] &quot;Olé!&quot;.
*[[Masha Allah|Mā shā' Allāh]] (ما شاء الله) ([Look at] what God has willed!)
*[[Subhan'allah|Subhān Allāh]] (سبحان الله) (Glory be to God)
*[[alhamdulillah|al-Hamdu li-llāh]] (الحمد لله) (All praise be to God)
*[[Allāhu A`alam]] (الله أعلم) (God knows best)
*[[Jazaka Allāhu khayran]] (جزاك الله خيراً) (May God reward you for your deeds)

&quot;Allāh&quot; appears in a stylized form on the [[flag of Iran]], in the phrase &quot;Allāhu Akbar&quot; on the [[flag of Iraq]], and as part of the [[shahadah|shahādah]] on the [[flag of Saudi Arabia]].

&quot;Allah&quot; is not correctly used as a man's name. See [[Arabic name#Mistakes made by Europeans and other non-Arabs]].

==Islamic concept of God==
{{main|Islamic concept of God}} 

The Islamic concept of mankind's place in the universe hinges on the notion that '''[[Allāh]]''', or '''[[God]]''', is the only true [[reality]]. There is nothing permanent other than Him. God is considered eternal and &quot;uncreated&quot;, whereas everything else in the universe is &quot;created.&quot; The Qur'an describes Him in [[Sura 112]]: &quot;Say: He is Allāh, [[Singular]]. Allāh, the Absolute. He begetteth not nor was begotten. And to Him have never been one equal.&quot; (see [[Tawhid]] for more). The Qur'an condemns and mocks the pre-Islamic Arabs for attributing daughters to Allāh ([[sura 53]]:19.)

Muslims believe that Allāh, or [[God]], is the only true God who deserves to be worshipped. This belief must be accompanied by the acknowledgement that Mohammad was a true prophet of God who was chosen to guide people to believing and worshipping God in the correct manner. God is considered eternal and uncreated; with no beginning, whereas everything else in the universe is created with a beginning. The Qur'an mentions, (approximated in English)  [[Sura 112]]: &quot;Say: He is Allāh, Without partner. Allāh, the Absolute. He begetteth not nor was begotten. And to Him have never been one equal.&quot; (see [[Tawhid]] for more). 

God is considered by Muslims to be [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omnipresence|omnipresent]], and [[Omniscience|omniscient]]. In the Qur'an, God is described as being fully aware of everything that happens in the universe, and knows all things. God also knows what is in people's hearts and minds at all times. It is mentioned in the Qur'an (approximately), &quot;And He it is Who takes your souls at night (in sleep), and He knows what you acquire in the day, then He raises you up therein that an appointed term may be fulfilled; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you were doing. ([[sura 6]]:60)&quot; 

Placing  God inside his creation, or suggesting that nature or creation simultaneously co-exist in God or vice versa, as in other religious traditions, completely compromises exclusive Islamic monotheism. Attributing a partner, spouse, father, son, daughter, mother or other relation(s) to Allah, literally or metaphorically, partially or completely, is considered unquestionably blasphemous by Muslims.

Therefore, Muslims consider it blasphemous to describe Jesus (or another man, woman child etc) as 'Son of God' whether literally or metaphorically. Similarly, Muslims do not believe that God resembles a man (old or young), woman, half man half woman, half man half animal , bird, elephant or other animal or other creation. It is forbidden for Muslims to view God [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphically]].

Allah does not resemble any of his creations in any way whatsoever. Allah is not attributed with shape, colour, size, position, location, direction and indeed all of these attributes are found in the creatures Allah created.

Further, Muslims do not believe that Allah is located in a place, whether on Earth, below the Earth, in the Sky, above the Sky, on a Throne above the Sky or all of these places at once or anywhere else or everywhere, but rather, God exists without a place (given he created all places and locations) and the perfectness of his existence is not compromised by his existence not being bound to a created (by Allah) place or location.

God is attributed with complete perfection in his attributes and is free from any defects or any imperfections. Allah is attributed (amongst other attributes) with oneness (without a partner in God's self or attributes), non-beginningness, eternalness, complete freedom from needing others (i.e. each or any of his creations), complete power to do all things, Will (to do as he wills, as and when God decides without any obstruction), knowledge, (of all things simultaneously, past, present and future) hearing (of all sounds without needing any implement or organ to hear), sight (without needing eyes or any other organ or instrument nor light rays to illuminate an area or an object), life (unlike the human or other life which is created and limited, but that which befits him with no beginning or end), speech (unlike the human, created speech which is constituted of languages, letters and sounds but rather an eternal speech which is not a creation but an attribute of God) and the complete non-resemblence of any creation in his self or attributes.

==History==
It was used in pre-Islamic times by Pagans within the Arabian peninsula to signify the supreme creator. Pre-Islamic  Jews referred to their supreme creator as [[Yahweh]] or [[Elohim]].  The pagan Arabs recognized &quot;Allāh&quot; as the supreme God in their [[Pre-Islamic mythology|pantheon]]; along with Allah, however, the pre-Islamic Arabs believed in a host of other gods, such as [[Hubal]] and 'daughters of Allāh' (the three daughters associated were [[Al-lat|al-Lāt]], [[Al-Uzza|al-`Uzzah]], and [[Manah]]) (Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend, ''&quot;The Facts on File&quot;'', ed. Anthony Mercatante, [[New York]], [[1983]], I:61). This view of Allah by the pre-Islamic pagans is viewed by Muslims as a latter development having arisen as a result of moving away from Abrahamic monotheism over time. Some of the names of these pagan gods are said to be derived from the descendants of Noah, whom latter generations firstly revered as saints, and then transformed into gods (although non-Muslims often view polytheism as having come before monotheism). The pagan Arabians also used the word &quot;Allāh&quot; in the names of their children; [[Muhammad]]'s father, who was born into pagan society, was named &quot;`Abdullāh&quot;, which translates &quot;servant of Allāh&quot;. &quot;`Abdullāh&quot; is still used for names of Muslim and non-Muslim arabs.

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for deity, [[Names of God in Judaism#El|El]] (אל) or [[Names of God in Judaism#Elohim|Elōah]] (אלוה), was used as an [[Old Testament]] synonym for [[Yahweh]] (יהוה), which is the proper name for the Jewish God according to the [[Tanakh]]. The [[Aramaic]] word for God is ''alôh-ô'' ([[Syriac]] dialect) or elâhâ (Biblical dialect), which comes from the same Proto-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] word (''*ʾilâh-'') as the Arabic and Hebrew terms; [[Jesus]] is described in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 15:34 as having used the word on the cross, with the ending meaning &quot;my&quot;, when saying, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; (transliterated in Greek as ''elō-i'').  One of the earliest surviving translations of the word into a foreign language is in a [[Greek language|Greek]] translation of the [[Shahada]], from 86-96 AH ([[705]]-[[715]] AD), which translates it as ''ho theos monos''[http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Papyri/enlp1.html], literally &quot;the one god&quot;. Also the cognate Aramaic term appears in the Aramaic version of the ''New Testament'', called the [[Pshitta]] (or Peshitta) as one of the words Jesus used to refer to God, e.g., in the sixth Beatitude, &quot;Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see Alāha.&quot; And in the Arabic Bible the same words ([[Matthew 5:8|Mt 5:8]]): &quot;طُوبَى لأَنْقِيَاءِ الْقَلْبِ، فَإِنَّهُمْ سَيَرَوْنَ الله&quot;

==Other beliefs==
[[The Nation of Gods and Earths]], one of the many sects created as the result of black separatist movements in the United States, holds that the word &quot;Allāh&quot; is the name of the original black man and stands for &quot;Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head&quot;. [http://web.archive.org/web/20041019023127/http://www.ibiblio.org/nge/] [http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2002-10-29-oped-goldblatt_x.htm] This concept is alien to mainstream Islam, which strictly opposes any attempt to portray Allāh as a human or in any other way. Mainstream Islam also prohibits attibuting divine qualities to, worshipping, or glorifying anything other than Allāh.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]], whose [[:Category:Bahá'í texts|scriptures]] are primarily written in [[Arabic]] and [[Farsi]], also uses '''Allah''' to mean God, though in practice the customary word for God in the local language is typically used when speaking in that language.  Some particular uses are not translated, but the Arabic phrase is used.  The chief example of this would be the Bahá'í customary greeting '''Alláh'u'abhá''' which is commonly translated as ''God is the All Glorious''.

'''Antarctica''' ([[Greek language|Greek]], ''antarktikos'': &quot;opposite the [[Arctic]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon '' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=%239514 &quot;antarktikos&quot;].

It is a [[desert|cold desert]] and, on average, the coldest place on Earth.  98% of the continent is covered by [[ice]]. Its 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; make it the fifth largest continent and the world's largest [[desert]]. There are no permanent human residents, and only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguins]], [[fur seals]], [[lichen]]s, and hundreds of types of [[algae]]. 

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) go back to antiquity, the first commonly accepted sighting of the continent occurred in 1820 and the first verified landing in 1821 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent had been largely neglected in the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of efficient resources, and its isolated location.

Antarctica is not under the political sovereignty of any nation, although seven countries ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) maintain territorial claims. Most other countries do not recognise these claims, and the claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom all overlap. Its usage is regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959 by 12 countries, which prohibits any military activity, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]].  Ongoing experiments are conducted yearly by more than 4,000 scientists of diverse backgrounds and interests.

In the Western world, beliefs in a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent located in the far south of the globe to &quot;balance&quot; out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa—had existed for centuries. Even by late in the 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of &quot;Antarctica&quot;, geographers believed the continent was much larger than its true size. European maps continued to show this land until [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] and the crews of his expedition's ships, ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on [[January 17]], [[1773]] and again in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;The Mariners' Museum [http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php ''Age of Exploration - James Cook''].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Antarctica}}

[[Image:Antarctica satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|150px|A satellite composite image of Antarctica]]
The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Mt erebus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mt. Erebus]], an active volcano in [[Ross Island]].]]
Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Deception Island]] and [[Mt. Erebus]] are active. Mount Erebus, located in [[Ross Island]], is the southernmost active volcano on Earth. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/About_Antarctica/Rock/Volcanoes.html Volcanoes]. Retrieved February 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, an underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers. Recent evidence shows this unnamed volcano may be active.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation. [http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100385 Scientists Discover Undersea Volcano Off Antarctica]. Retrieved February 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet, including one under the South Pole itself. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath [[Russia]]'s [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. Due to the lake's similarity to [[Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]], confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on Europa.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/fslakevostok.htm Lake Vostok] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
===Gondwana breakup===
More than 170 million years ago (Mya), Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. [[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}

[[Image:Lake Fryxell.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|Blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]
Antarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sundog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright &quot;spot&quot; beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Antarctic researchers.jpg|thumb|Two American researchers studying [[plankton]] through [[microscope]]s.]]
Although Antarctica has no permanent residents, a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter. Many of the stations are staffed around the year.

[[Emilio Marcos Palma]] was the first person born in Antarctica (Base Esperanza) in 1978, his parents being sent there along with seven other families by the Argentinean government to determine if family life was suitable in the continent. In 1986 Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antarctic Sun'' [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html Questions and answers] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
{{main|Antarctic flora}}
[[Image:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|left|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist. A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. 

There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.  There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic pearlwort]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Antarctic Division [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551 Antarctic Wildlife] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

Land [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] is completely [[invertebrate]]. Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. 

A variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Adélie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem. Particularly, the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

==Politics==
Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. [http://www.scar.org/treaty/ ''Antarctic Treaty''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no government. Various countries claim areas of it, but most countries do not recognize those claims. The area between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west is the only land on Earth not claimed by any country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

The only documented large-scale land military maneuver was &quot;[[Operación 90]]&quot;, undertaken 10 years before the Antarctic Treaty by the [[Military of Argentina|Argentinian military]].&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica Institute of Argentina.

Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they exist in quantities too small to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] prevents such struggle for resources. In 1998 a compromise agreement was reached to add a 50-year ban on mining until the year 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary agricultural activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish.

Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. [[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment.

In 1998 [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot; /&gt;

{{wiktionarypar|Argentina}}

The '''Argentine Republic''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''República Argentina'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[reˈpuβlika aɾxɛnˈtina]}}) is a [[country]] in [[South America]], situated between the [[Andes]] in the west and the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east and south. It is bordered by [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] in the north, [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]] in the northeast, and [[Chile]] in the west and south. It also claims the [[British overseas territory|British overseas territories]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. Under the name of [[Argentine Antarctica]], it claims around 1,000,000 [[square kilometre]]s (386,000&amp;nbsp;[[square miles|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]) of [[Antarctica]], overlapping other claims by [[Chile]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. By area, it is the second largest country of South America after Brazil and the 8th largest country in the [[world]].

The country is formally named ''República Argentina'' {{audio|1=es-Argentina.ogg|2=(pronunciation)}} (Argentine Republic), while for purposes of [[Law of Argentina|legislation]] the form ''Nación Argentina'' (Argentine Nation) is used.

==Origin and history of the name==
{{main|Origin and history of the name of Argentina}}

The name '''Argentina''' derives from the [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ([[silver]]). The first [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s called the River Plate the [[Río de la Plata]] (&quot;River of Silver&quot;). Indigenous people gave silver gifts to the survivors of the shipwrecked expedition, who were led by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]]. The legend of [[Sierra del Plata]] &amp;mdash; a mountain rich in silver &amp;mdash; reached Spain around [[1524]]. The name Argentina was first used in Ruy Díaz de Guzmán's 1612 book ''Historia del descubrimiento, población, y conquista del Río de la Plata'' (History of the discovery, population, and conquest of the Río de la Plata), naming the territory ''Tierra Argentina'' (Land of Silver).

==History==
{{main|History of Argentina}}

The area of present Argentina was sparsely populated until it was colonised by [[european|Europeans]]. The native people known as [[Diaguita]] lived in northwestern Argentina on the edge of the expanding [[Inca Empire]]; the [[Guaraní]] lived farther east.

Europeans arrived in [[1502]]. [[Spain]] established a permanent colony on the site of [[Buenos Aires]] in [[1580]], and the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in [[1776]]. Independence from Spain was declared on [[July 9]] [[1816]]. Centralist and federationist groups were in conflict, until national unity was established and the [[Argentine constitution|constitution]] promulgated in [[1853]].

Foreign [[investment]] and [[Immigration in Argentina|immigration]] from Europe aided the introduction of modern agricultural techniques and integration of Argentina into the world economy in the late 19th century. In the 1880s the &quot;[[Conquest of the Desert]]&quot; subdued or exterminated the remaining native tribes throughout [[Patagonia]].

From [[1880]] to [[1930]] Argentina became one of the ten wealthiest nations. Conservative forces dominated Argentine politics until [[1916]], when their traditional rivals, the [[Radical Civic Union|Radicals]], won control of the government. The military forced [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] from power in 1930 leading to another decade of Conservative rule.

Political change led to the presidency of [[Juan Perón]] in [[1946]], who aimed at empowering the working class and greatly expanded the number of unionised workers. The [[Revolución Libertadora]] of [[1955]] deposed him.

In the 1950s and 1960s, military and civilian administrations traded power. When military governments failed to revive the economy and suppress escalating [[terrorism]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the way was open for Perón's return to the presidency in 1973, with his third wife, [[Isabel Perón|María Estela Isabel Martínez de Perón]], as Vice President. During this period, extremists on the [[political left|left]] and [[political right|right]] carried out [[terrorism|terrorist]] acts with a frequency that threatened public order.

[[Image:Buenos Aires-2672f-Banco de la Nación Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|Bank of the Argentine Nation, Buenos Aires]]

Perón died in [[1974]]. His wife succeeded him in office, but a military coup removed her from office in [[1976]], and the armed forces formally exercised power through a [[junta]] in charge of the self-appointed [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional|National Reorganisation Process]], until [[1983]]. The armed forces repressed opposition using harsh illegal measures (the &quot;[[Dirty War]]&quot;); thousands of dissidents were &quot;[[desaparecidos|disappeared]]&quot;, while the [[SIDE]] cooperated with the [[CIA]], [[DINA]] and other South American intelligence agencies in [[Operation Condor]]. Many of the military leaders that took part in the Dirty War were trained in the U.S. financed [[School of the Americas]]. Among them Argentine dictators [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] and [[Roberto Viola]].

Economic problems, charges of corruption, public revulsion in the face of [[human rights]] abuses and, finally, the country's [[1982]] defeat in the [[Falklands War]] discredited the Argentine military regime. 

Democracy was restored in [[1983]]. [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s Radical government took steps intending to account for the &quot;disappeared&quot;, establishing civilian control of the armed forces and consolidating democratic institutions. Failure to resolve endemic economic problems and an inability to maintain public confidence caused his early departure.

President [[Carlos Menem]] imposed [[Argentine peso|peso]]-[[US dollar|dollar]] [[fixed exchange rate]] in [[1991]] to stop [[hyperinflation]], and adopted far-reaching market-based policies, dismantling [[protectionism|protectionist]] barriers and business [[deregulation|regulations]], and implementing a privatisation program. These reforms contributed to significant increases in investment and growth with stable prices through most of the 1990s.

The Menem and [[Fernando de la Rúa|de la Rúa]] administrations faced diminished competitiveness of exports, massive imports which damaged national industry and reduced employment, chronic fiscal and trade deficits, and the contagion of several economic crises. The [[Asian financial crisis]] in [[1998]] precipitated an outflow of capital that mushroomed into a [[recession]], which led to a total freezing of the [[bank account]]s (the ''[[corralito]]''), and culminated in a financial panic in November 2001. The next month, amidst [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|bloody riots]], President de la Rúa resigned.

Several new presidents followed in quick succession. Argentina [[default (finance)|default]]ed on its international debt obligations. The peso's almost 12-year-old link with the dollar was abandoned, resulting in massive [[devaluation|currency depreciation]] and [[inflation]], in turn triggering a spike in unemployment and poverty. In [[2003]], [[Néstor Kirchner]] became the president, and started implementing new policies based on re-industrialisation, [[import substitution]], increased exports, consistent fiscal surplus, and high exchange rate.

==Politics==
[[Image:Buenos Aires Congreso stock xchng 214239.jpg|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos Aires]]
{{main|Politics of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Law of Argentina}}

The [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine constitution]] of 1853, as [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|revised in 1994]], mandates a [[Separation of powers|separation of powers]] into [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial branch]]es at the national and provincial level. The [[president of Argentina|president]] and vice-president are directly elected to 4-year terms. Both are limited to two consecutive terms; they are allowed to stand for a third term or more after an interval of at least one term. The president appoints [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] ministers, and the constitution grants him considerable power as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], including authority to enact laws by presidential decree under conditions of &quot;urgency and necessity&quot; and the [[line-item veto]].

Argentina's [[parliament]] is the bicameral [[National Congress]] or ''[[Argentine National Congress|Congreso de la Nación]]'', consisting of a [[Senate]] (''[[Argentine Senate|Senado]]'') of 72 seats and a [[Chamber of Deputies]] (''[[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Cámara de Diputados]]'') of 257 members. Since 2001, senators have been directly elected, with each province, including the [[Federal Capital]], represented by three senators. Senators serve 6-year terms. One-third of the Senate stands for reelection every 2 years via a partial majority system in each district. Members of the Chamber of Deputies are directly elected to 4-year term via a system of [[proportional representation]]. Voters elect half the members of the [[lower house]] every 2 years.

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Military of Argentina}}

Argentina is currently prompting the [[Mercosur]] as its first external priority, contrasting with the 1990s' emphasis in the relationship with the [[United States]].

==Administrative divisions==
[[Image:Argentina provinces.png|framed|Provinces of Argentina. Argentine Antarctica and Southern Atlantic Islands (23) not shown.]]
{{main|Provinces of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Governors in Argentina}}

Argentina is divided into 23 [[province]]s (''provincias''; singular: ''provincia''), and 1 [[autonomous city]] (commonly known as ''capital federal''), marked with an asterisk:

&lt;/ol&gt;
|}
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; The current official name for the [[federal district]] is &quot;Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires&quot;.

Buenos Aires has been the capital of Argentina since its unification, but there have been projects to move the administrative centre elsewhere. During the presidency of Raúl Alfonsín a law was passed ordering the move of the federal capital to [[Viedma]], a city in the Patagonic province of Río Negro. Studies were underway when hyperinflation, in 1989, killed off the project. Though the law was never formally repealed, it has become a mere historical relic, and the project has been forgotten.

===Urbanization===
{{main|List of cities in Argentina}}
[[Image:Tucuman_govthouse.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Government house of Tucumán]]
About 2.7 million people live in the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]], and roughly 11.5 million in [[Gran Buenos Aires|Greater Buenos Aires]] (2001), making it one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world. Together with their respective [[metropolitan area]]s, the second and third largest cities in Argentina, [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Rosario]], comprise about 1.3 and 1.1 million inhabitants, respectively.

Most European [[immigration in Argentina|immigrants to Argentina]] (coming in great waves especially around the World War I and II) settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the [[middle class]]. Since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.

The 1990s saw many rural towns become [[ghost town]]s when train services were abandoned and local products manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of imported cheap goods, in part because of the monetary policy which kept the U.S. dollar exchange rate fixed and low. Many slums (''[[villa miseria|villas miseria]]'') sprouted in the outskirts of the largest cities, inhabited by empoverished low-class urban dwellers and migrants from smaller towns in the interior of the country. However, it is important to note that the majority of the people that live in these newly formed small shanty towns are people that came from neighboring countries during the time of convertibility and never left. This immigration of humble people from a low socioeconomic status represented an undesirable change because shanty towns and homeless people begging for money was something Argentines didn't know until the economic disaster of the 1990s. However, the government works actively to try to include these new inmigrants into Argentine society and considers their children born in Argentina to be Argentines. There are no plans to build any type of wall to keep these inmigrants out. Argentina adheres to a policy of allowing anybody who wants to come to Argentina to come freely without restrictive inmigration measures. In this respect Argentina is more progressive than many fully developed countries. 

&lt;!-- to be filled in with middle class home data --&gt;
Argentina's urban areas have a European look, reflecting the influence of their European settlers. Many towns and cities are built like Spanish cities around a main square called a plaza. A cathedral and important government buildings often face the plaza. The general layout of the cities is called a ''damero'', that is, a checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks, though modern developments sometimes depart from it (for example, the city of La Plata, built at the end of the 19th century, is organised as a checkerboard plus diagonal avenues at fixed intervals).

In descending order by number of inhabitants, the major cities in Argentina are [[Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Rosario]], [[Mendoza]], [[La Plata]], [[Tucumán]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[Salta]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and [[Bahía Blanca]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Ar-map.png|200px|thumb|Map of Argentina]]
{{main|Geography of Argentina}}

Argentina can roughly be divided into three parts: the fertile plains of the [[Pampa]]s in the central part of the country, the centre of Argentina's [[agriculture|agricultural]] wealth; the flat to rolling plateau of [[Patagonia]] in the southern half down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; and the rugged [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]], with the highest point being the [[Cerro Aconcagua]] at 6,960 metres (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).

Major rivers include the [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. The latter two flow together before meeting the [[Atlantic Ocean]], forming the estuary of the [[Río de la Plata]]. The Argentine [[climate]] is predominantly [[temperate climate|temperate]] with extremes ranging from [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] in the north to arid/sub-Antarctic in far south.

=== Enclaves and exclaves ===
There is one Argentine [[exclave]]: the island of [[Martín García]] (co-ordinates {{coor dm|34|11|S|58|15|W}}). It is situated near the confluence of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, a mere kilometre (0.62&amp;nbsp;mi) inside [[Uruguay]]an waters, about 3.5 kilometres (2.1 mi) from the Uruguayan coastline, near the small city of [[Martín Chico]] (itself about halfway between [[Nueva Palmira]] and [[Colonia del Sacramento]]).

An agreement reached by Argentina and Uruguay in 1973 reaffirmed Argentine jurisdiction over the island, ending a century-old dispute between the two countries. According to the terms of the agreement, Martín García is to be devoted exclusively to a natural preserve. Its area is about 2 square kilometres (500&amp;nbsp;[[acre]]s), and the population about 200 people.

==Economy==
[[Image:Buenos Aires Monserrat.jpg|thumb|250px|Subway station in Monserrat, Buenos Aires]]
{{main|Economy of Argentina}}
{{seealso|Tourism in Argentina}}

Argentina benefits from rich [[natural resource]]s, a highly [[literate]] population, an export-oriented [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector, and a diversified [[industry|industrial]] base. The country historically had a large middle class, compared to other Latin American countries, but this segment of the population was decimated by a succession of economic crises. Today, while a significant segment of the population is still financially well-off, they stay in sharp contrast with millions who live in poverty or on the brink of it.

Since the late 1970s the country piled up public debt and was plagued by bouts of high [[inflation]]. In 1991, the government [[fixed exchange rate|pegged]] the peso to the [[United States dollar|U. S. dollar]] and limited the growth in the [[monetary base]]. The government then embarked on a path of [[free trade|trade liberalisation]], [[deregulation]], and [[privatisation]]. Inflation dropped and [[gross domestic product|GDP]] grew, but external economic shocks and failures of the system diluted its benefits, causing it to crumble in slow motion, from 1995 and up to the [[Argentine economic crisis|collapse in 2001]].

By 2002 Argentina had [[default (finance)|default]]ed on its debt, its GDP had shrunk, [[unemployment]] was over 25%, the peso had [[devaluation|devalued]] 75% after being [[floating exchange rate|floated]], and inflation was hitting again. However, careful spending control and heavy [[tax]]es on now soaring exports gave the state the tools to regain resources and conduct [[monetary policy]].

In 2003, [[import substitution]] policies and soaring [[export]]s, coupled with a lower inflation and expansive economic measures, triggered a surge in the GDP, which was repeated in 2004, creating jobs and encouraging internal consumption. [[Capital flight]] decreased, and [[foreign investment]] slowly returned. The influx of foreign currency from exports created such a huge [[trade surplus]] that the Central Bank was forced to buy dollars from the market, which it continues to do at the time, to be accumulated as [[reserve currency|reserves]].

The situation in 2005 is much improved, but there are still large numbers of unemployed people that beg for some money or food, especially in the outskirts of [[Buenos Aires]]. Some of them are homeless, and there is at least one small non-profit humanitarian organisation which distributes free food to some of them most days of the week. However, the country is still the most developed country in Latin America. It boasts the highest GDP per capita, the highest levels of education measured by university attendance, and a reasonable infrastructure that in many aspects is equal in quality to that found in fully industrialized nations. In 2002 over 57% of the population was below the poverty line, at the end of 2005 it was 34%. In 2002 unemployement had reached over 25%, and now it is 10%. GDP per capita has surpassed the previous pre-recession peek of 1998. It is a very interesting time in Argentina because the experts agree that if the country makes the right decisions it could develop and reclaim its previosly held position in the first world. So far things are looking good; the economy grew 8.8% in 2003, 9.0% in 2004, and 9.1% in 2005. The floor is set so that the economy will grow between 6.0% and 7.5% in 2006 and the government is paying down the foreign debt; foreign debt now stands at 69% of GDP and is slowly decreasing. The Argentine economy has so much untapped potential that if the country manages to encourage the proper level of investment the country could experience growth rates of 9.0% for this year and years to come.

==Demographics==
[[Image:TeatroColon.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Night shot of the Colon Theatre in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]
{{main|Demographics of Argentina}}

Unlike most of its neighbouring countries, Argentina's population descends overwhelmingly from [[Europe|Europeans]]. The basic demographic stock (97% of the population) [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ar.html] is made up of descendants of [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[Germany|German]] and other [[Europe|European]] settlers. 

Waves of immigrants from [[Europe]]an countries arrived in the late [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th centuries]]. The Patagonian [[Chubut Valley]] has a significant [[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Welsh-descended population]] and retains many aspects of [[Wales|Welsh]] culture. Other important immigrant groups came from [[Germany]] ([[Germany|German]] colonies were settled in the provinces of Entre Ríos, Misiones, Formosa, Córdoba and the Patagonian region, as well as in Buenos Aires itself), [[France]] (mostly settled in Buenos Aires city and province), [[Scandinavia]] (especially [[Sweden]]), the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] (Buenos Aires and Patagonia), and [[Eastern Europe]]an nations, such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and the [[Balkans]] region (especially [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]]) and others. The overwhelming majority of Argentina's [[Jew|Jewish]] community, numbering about 395,379  [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html], also derives from immigrants of Northern and Eastern European origin &amp;mdash; [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. It is the largest Jewish community in [[Latin America]] and fifth largest in the world.

[[Middle East]]ern immigrants number about 500,000, mainly in urban areas.{{Citation needed}}

Small numbers of people from [[Far East]] [[Asia]] have also settled Argentina, mainly in Buenos Aires. The first [[Asian-Argentines]] were of [[Japan]]ese descent, but [[Korea]]ns, [[Vietnam]]ese, and [[China|Chinese]] soon followed. There are also smaller numbers of people from the [[Indian subcontinent]].

==Culture==
[[Image:Buenos_Aires-Center-P3050007.JPG|thumb|European and modern styles in Buenos Aires]]
{{main|Culture of Argentina}}
{{seealso|List of Argentines}}
Argentine culture has been primarily informed and influenced by its European roots. Buenos Aires is undeniably the most European city in [[South America]], due both to the prevalence of people of Italian, Spanish and German descent and to conscious imitation.

Argentine cinema has achieved international recognition with films such as &quot;[[The Official Story]]&quot; and &quot;[[Nine Queens]]&quot;, though it has only rarely been taken into account by mainstream popular viewers who prefer Hollywood-type movies. Even low-budget productions, however, have obtained prizes in cinema festivals (such as [[Cannes]]). The city of [[Mar del Plata]] organizes its own festival dedicated to this art.

The best-known element of Argentine culture is probably their music and dance, particularly [[tango (dance)|tango]]. In modern Argentina, tango music is enjoyed in its own right, especially since the radical [[Astor Piazzolla]] redefined the music of [[Carlos Gardel]]. It must be noted that while tango refers mostly to a particular dancing music for foreigners, the music together with the lyrics (often sung in a kind of slang called [[lunfardo]]) are what most Argentines primarily mean by tango. Tango lyrics can be considered a kind of poetry. 
Since the 1970s rock and roll is also widely appreciated in Argentina. First during the 1970s and then again at the mid 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, national rock and roll and pop music experienced bursts of popularity, with many new bands (such as [[Soda Stereo]] and Sumo) and composers (like [[Charly García]] and [[Fito Páez]]) becoming important referents of national culture.
[[Buenos Aires]] is also considered the [[techno]]/[[electronica]] country in Latin America, that started with little raves, and nowadays is home of important events such as [[Creamfields]] (which has the world record of 65,000 people), South American Music Conference and many more.

[[European classical music]] is well-considered in Argentina, with the [[Colón Theater]] one of the best opera houses in the world. Musicians such as [[Martha Argerich]] and composers like [[Lalo Schifrin]] have become internationally famous.

===Language===
{{main|List of Native American languages in Argentina}}
{{seealso|Welsh settlement in Argentina}}
[[Image:Buenos Aires-Puente de la Mujer.jpg|thumb|250px|Women's Bridge in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires]]
The only official language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], although some immigrants and indigenous communities have retained their [[List of Native American languages in Argentina|original languages]] in specific points of the country. There are, for example many [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaking towns in Patagonia and [[German language|German]]-speaking cities in Córdoba, Buenos Aires and cities in the Patagonia. Italian and French is also widely spoken.

Argentina is the largest [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking community in the world that employs ''[[voseo]]'' (the use of the [[pronoun]] ''vos'' instead of ''tú'', associated with some alternate verb conjugations). The most prevalent dialect is [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]], with most speakers located in the basin of the [[Río de la Plata]].

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Argentina}}
Argentina is an overwhelmingly [[Christian]] country. The majority of Argentina's population (80%) is at least nominally [[Roman Catholic]]. Roman Catholicism is supported by the state, as stipulated in the Constitution. Evangelical churches gained a place in Argentina especially since the 1980s and now number more than 3.5 million or 10%. Members of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]) number over 330,300, the seventh largest concentration in the world[http://www.lds.org.ar/noticias2005/noti_ene2005/info_noti_ene2005_05.htm]. Traditional [[Protestant]] communities are also present.

The country also hosts the largest [[Judaism|Jewish]] population in [[Latin America]], about 395,379 strong. It is also home to one of the largest [[mosque]]s in Latin America, serving Argentina's small [[Islam|Muslim]] community.

The '''Republic of Armenia''', or '''Armenia''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: {{Hayeren|Հայաստան}}, ''Hayastan'', {{Hayeren|Հայք}}, ''Hayq''), is a [[landlocked]] [[Eurasian]] country in the [[Caucasus]] region, bordered by [[Turkey]] to the west, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the north, [[Azerbaijan]] to the east, and [[Iran]] and the [[Nakhichevan]] [[exclave]] of Azerbaijan to the south. Armenia is a member of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] and for centuries has been on the crossroads between the east and west.

== Origin of the name ==
The original [[Armenian language|Armenian]] name for the country was ''Hayq'', later ''Hayastan'', translated as ''the land of Haik'', and consisting of the name Haik and the [[Persian language|Persian]] suffix '[[-stan]]' (land). According to legend, [[Haik]] was a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]] (son of [[Togarmah]], who was a son of [[Gomer]], a son of Noah's son, [[Japheth]]), and according to an ancient Armenian tradition, a forefather of all [[Armenian people|Armenians]]. He is said to have settled below [[Mount Ararat]], travelled to assist in building the [[Tower of Babel]], and, after his return, defeated the [[Babylon|Babylonian]] king Bel (believed by some researchers to be [[Nimrod]]) on [[August 11]], [[25th century BC|2492 BC]] near [[Lake Van]], in the southern part of historic Armenia (presently in [[Turkey]]).

Hayq was given the name Armenia by the surrounding states, as it was the name of the strongest tribe living in the historic Armenian lands, who called themselves ''Armens''. It is traditionally derived from ''Armenak'' or ''Aram'' (the great-grandson of Haik's great-grandson, and another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of all Armenians). Some Jewish and Christian scholars write that the name 'Armenia' was derived from ''Har-Minni'',
