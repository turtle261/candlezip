[95m## Task:[00m [92mYou act as a deterministic research agent. Given the observed prefix of a document, use available MCP tools to retrieve information that is likely to appear later in the same document. Prefer authoritative sources. Produce a concise textual synopsis of the likely future content (facts, equations, definitions, datasets, references), suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. Maximize relevance to the document. Do not hallucinate; only include content supported by the tools.

Document prefix (UTF-8 text):

H(S) = H(X)/E[B] almost surely.

As a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to exploit.

Then, from the results of [1], we can see that

Pr ( H(X) ≤ lim NT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) ) = 1, (5)

where qi(·) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is given by

H(S) ≤ limNT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) / E[B] . (6)

We refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by Hub. The numerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens XNT and the denominator in (6) is the average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3 bits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and discussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance of several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc is the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.

### B. Encoding schemes

We consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.

1) **Compressing the ranks using zlib:** The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks. We refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by ρLLaMA+zlib.

2) **Token-by-Token Compression:** The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a time-varying codebook to encode the token xi at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming qi to be the true distribution of the tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where the codeword for the token xi is of length li = ⌈log2 1/qi(xi)⌉. A prefix-free code with this length for xi is guaranteed to exist since this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by ρLLaMA+TbyT, is given by

ρLLaMA+TbyT = �NT i=1 ⌈log2 1/qi(xi)⌉ / �NT i=1 bi .

3) **Arithmetic Coding:** The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to combine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding is well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use qi(xi) as the probability of token xi at time in the arithmetic coding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as ρLLM+AC. It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly optimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be

ρLLM+AC ≈ �NT i=1 log2 1/qi(xi) / �NT i=1 bi . (7)

Clearly, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). Hub, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind when interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.

## IV. RESULTS

We used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary of size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction with the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase letters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet is restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between these models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM. Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of LLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ algorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the paq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ or paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.

The performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average performance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the state-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the LLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I also shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by Shannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].

The dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) is shown in Table II. As expected, the compression performance improves with increasing M. We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly with the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a memory of 31 tokens.

It is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA-7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds to estimates obtained from different input sizes.

It appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset is derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.

Therefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project Gutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8 dataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset. Table IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the entropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of LLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression ratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).

To provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors, we also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input

Document prefix (UTF-8 text):

H(S) = H(X)/E[B] almost surely.

As a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to exploit.

Then, from the results of [1], we can see that

Pr ( H(X) ≤ lim NT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) ) = 1, (5)

where qi(·) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is given by

H(S) ≤ limNT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) / E[B] . (6)

We refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by Hub. The numerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens XNT and the denominator in (6) is the average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3 bits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and discussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance of several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc is the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.

### B. Encoding schemes

We consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.

1) **Compressing the ranks using zlib:** The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks. We refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by ρLLaMA+zlib.

2) **Token-by-Token Compression:** The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a time-varying codebook to encode the token xi at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming qi to be the true distribution of the tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where the codeword for the token xi is of length li = ⌈log2 1/qi(xi)⌉. A prefix-free code with this length for xi is guaranteed to exist since this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by ρLLaMA+TbyT, is given by

ρLLaMA+TbyT = �NT i=1 ⌈log2 1/qi(xi)⌉ / �NT i=1 bi .

3) **Arithmetic Coding:** The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to combine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding is well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use qi(xi) as the probability of token xi at time in the arithmetic coding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as ρLLM+AC. It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly optimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be

ρLLM+AC ≈ �NT i=1 log2 1/qi(xi) / �NT i=1 bi . (7)

Clearly, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). Hub, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind when interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.

## IV. RESULTS

We used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary of size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction with the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase letters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet is restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between these models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM. Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of LLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ algorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the paq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ or paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.

The performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average performance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the state-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the LLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I also shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by Shannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].

The dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) is shown in Table II. As expected, the compression performance improves with increasing M. We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly with the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a memory of 31 tokens.

It is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA-7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds to estimates obtained from different input sizes.

It appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset is derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.

Therefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project Gutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8 dataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset. Table IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the entropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of LLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression ratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).

To provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors, we also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. Analyze the document prefix:
    - Identify explicit mentions of future sections (e.g., "IV. RESULTS", "B. Encoding schemes").
    - Note all references to tables (Table I, Table II, Table III, Table IV) and their described content.
    - Extract all cited references (e.g., [1], [2], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]) along with any associated authors or context provided in the prefix.
    - Identify key concepts, equations, and definitions already introduced that are likely to be further elaborated.

2. Extract key terms and references for tool-based information retrieval:
    - From the prefix, list specific terms and references that can be used as queries for the available tools. Examples: "Cover and King entropy", "LLaMA-7B", "SentencePiece tokenizer", "text8 dataset", "ZPAQ algorithm", "paq8h algorithm", "Arithmetic Coding", "Kraft inequality".

3. Use available tools to retrieve concise, factual information about the cited references and key concepts:
    - For general concepts and definitions (e.g., Kraft inequality, zlib, Huffman code, Arithmetic Coding, SentencePiece tokenizer), use `search_wikipedia` to get a brief overview.
    - For specific papers, models, or algorithms (e.g., LLaMA-7B, ZPAQ, paq8h, Cover and King's work), use `search_papers` to find relevant information, focusing on summaries or key findings that align with the context given in the prefix.
    - Prioritize information that directly relates to the document's discussion of entropy, compression, and language models.
    - Do not attempt to download or read full papers unless a summary or key facts cannot be obtained from search results, to maintain conciseness.

4. Synthesize a concise textual synopsis of the likely future content:
    - Combine the explicit future content identified in step 1 (e.g., details about the "RESULTS" section, what each table will show).
    - Integrate relevant, concise factual information retrieved from the tools in step 3, ensuring it directly supports or elaborates on the concepts and references mentioned in the prefix.
    - The synopsis should cover:
        - Further details on the "Encoding schemes" (zlib, Token-by-Token, Arithmetic Coding).
        - The "RESULTS" section (IV), including the use of LLaMA-7B and SentencePiece tokenizer.
        - The specific findings presented in Table I (performance of LLaMA-7B), Table II (dependence on LLM memory), Table III (empirical mean and standard deviation), and Table IV (performance on Project Gutenberg book).
        - Comparisons with baseline algorithms (ZPAQ, paq8h) and other state-of-the-art results.
        - Discussion of the text8 and Project Gutenberg datasets.
        - Any caveats or limitations regarding the results (e.g., variance, input size, dataset bias).
        - Key facts or definitions from the cited papers that are directly relevant to the document's discussion.
    - Ensure the synopsis is highly relevant to the document, avoids hallucination, and only includes content supported by the prefix and the information retrieved via tools.

5. Review and refine:
    - Check for conciseness, accuracy, and adherence to all constraints (no hallucination, tool-supported content only, maximize relevance).
    - Ensure the language is suitable for conditioning a language model compressor.

The document will further elaborate on three encoding schemes for lossless compression: LLaMA+zlib, LLaMA+TbyT (Token-by-Token Compression using prefix-free codes based on `qi(xi)` and satisfying the Kraft inequality), and LLaMA+AC (Arithmetic Coding, which is nearly optimal and uses `qi(xi)` as probabilities). The Kraft inequality [8] states that for a prefix code, the sum of 2 raised to the power of negative codeword lengths is less than or equal to 1. Arithmetic coding [4, 9, 10] is a form of entropy encoding that encodes an entire message as a single fraction, representing the message as an interval within [0, 1). zlib is a software library used for data compression.

Section IV, "RESULTS," will detail the experimental setup and findings. It will describe the use of LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and the SentencePiece tokenizer [11], which produces a dictionary of size 32000. SentencePiece is a language-independent subword tokenizer. The experiments will benchmark LLaMA-7B's compression performance against state-of-the-art results on the `text8` dataset (a 100MB corpus of cleaned Wikipedia text from `http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip`). Baselines include the ZPAQ algorithm [5], which achieves 1.4 bits/character (bpc) on `text8`, and the paq8h algorithm [12], which achieves 1.2 bpc.

The results will be presented in several tables:
*   **Table I** will show the performance of LLaMA-7B across 10 batches of 100,000 tokens, with an average over 1M tokens. It will demonstrate that LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding achieves a compression ratio of 0.7101 bpc, outperforming ZPAQ and paq8h. The table will also include results for LLaMA+zlib, LLaMA+TbyT, and the computed upper bound (Hub).
*   **Table II** will illustrate the dependence of compression performance on the LLM's memory (M), indicating that performance improves with increasing M and inference time scales linearly with memory length.
*   **Table III** will provide the empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios, acknowledging the variance in estimates.
*   The discussion will address potential biases, such as LLaMA-7B being trained on Wikipedia, which overlaps with the `text8` dataset.
*   **Table IV** will present results from testing LLaMA-7B on a recently released Project Gutenberg book [7] (a digital library of free e-books), showing slightly higher but still competitive compression ratios (0.8426 bpc for LLaMA+AC) compared to `text8`.

The paper will compare its entropy estimates and compression ratios with prior work, including Shannon's [3] and Cover and King's [1] estimates (Cover and King provided 1.3 bpc for English entropy and discussed literature prior to 1976), and more recent estimates based on neural networks [2]. The final section will likely include a direct comparison of LLaMA-based compressors with standard text compressors like zlib.[00m
