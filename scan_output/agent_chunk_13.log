│  1. **Understand the Document Prefix:** I will thoroughly read the          │
│  provided document prefix to identify the main topics, existing results,    │
│  and explicit mentions of future content, such as tables and section        │
│  headers. I will note that the document discusses compression schemes       │
│  (ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, ρLLM+AC), benchmarks using LLaMA-7B on the      │
│  text8 dataset, comparisons with ZPAQ and paq8h, and mentions of Table I    │
│  (fully provided), Table II (partially provided header and first column),   │
│  Table III (mentioned as containing empirical mean and standard deviation   │
│  of entropy bounds and compression ratios), and Table IV (mentioned as      │
│  showing compression performance on a Project Gutenberg book). The prefix   │
│  also indicates that the document is in section "IV. RESULTS", implying     │
│  subsequent sections like "V. DISCUSSION", "VI. CONCLUSION", and            │

│  2. **Attempt to Locate Full Document:** To ensure I only include content   │
│  supported by the tools and avoid hallucination, my primary strategy is to  │
│  find the full document.                                                    │
│      *   I will use the `search_papers` tool with a highly specific query   │
│  derived from the document prefix to maximize the chance of finding the     │
│  exact paper. A suitable query would be: `query='LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic   │
│  Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101                │
│  bits/character'`.                                                          │
│      *   If a paper is found, I will extract its `paper_id`.                │
│      *   If the initial search fails, I will attempt a slightly broader     │
│  query: `query='LLaMA-7B compression arithmetic coding text8'`.             │
│      *   If no relevant paper is found after these attempts, I will         │
│  conclude that I am "NOT READY" as I cannot fulfill the "supported by       │
│  tools" constraint for retrieving *future content of this specific          │
│  document*.                                                                 │

│  3. **Extract Future Content (if document found):** Assuming the full       │
│  document is successfully located in step 2:                                │
│      *   I will use the `get_sections` tool with the obtained `paper_id`    │
│  to retrieve a list of all sections in the document.                        │
│      *   I will identify sections that logically follow "IV. RESULTS",      │
│  such as "V. DISCUSSION", "VI. CONCLUSION", "REFERENCES", and potentially   │
│  "APPENDIX".                                                                │
│      *   For each of these identified sections, I will use the              │
│  `summarize_article_section` tool (or `extract_key_facts` if                │
│  `summarize_article_section` is not suitable for the content) with the      │
│  `paper_id` and the `section_name` to obtain a concise summary of its       │
│  content.                                                                   │
│      *   Specifically, I will look for textual descriptions or summaries    │
│  of the data that would be presented in Table II, Table III, and Table IV   │
│  within the relevant sections (e.g., "RESULTS" or "DISCUSSION"). Since the  │
│  tools do not directly extract tables, I will rely on the textual           │
│  summaries to describe their content, including facts, equations,           │
│  definitions, datasets, and references.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Synthesize Concise Synopsis:** I will compile all the retrieved       │
│  information into a concise textual synopsis. This synopsis will focus on   │
│  the likely future content, including:                                      │
│      *   The full content or detailed description of Table II (compression  │
│  performance as a function of LLM memory M on text8).                       │
│      *   The full content or detailed description of Table III (empirical   │
│  mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios).     │
│      *   The full content or detailed description of Table IV (compression  │
│  performance on the Project Gutenberg book dataset).                        │
│      *   Key facts, discussions, and conclusions from subsequent sections   │
│  (e.g., "V. DISCUSSION", "VI. CONCLUSION").                                 │
│      *   The complete list of references cited in the document.             │
│      *   Any new definitions, equations, or datasets introduced in the      │
│  later parts of the document.                                               │
│      *   I will ensure the synopsis is highly relevant to the document      │
│  prefix and strictly adheres to the "no hallucination" and "supported by    │
│  tools" constraints.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      *   **Document Not Found:** If the full document cannot be located     │
│  using `search_papers`, I will explicitly state "NOT READY" and explain     │
│  that the task cannot be completed as per the "supported by tools"          │
│  constraint.                                                                │
│      *   **Table Extraction:** As direct table extraction is not            │
│  available, I will rely on the `summarize_article_section` tool to provide  │

│  and data points.                                                           │
│      *   **Conciseness:** I will carefully condense the extracted           │

│                                                                             │
│  **Expected Outcome:** A concise textual synopsis of the likely future      │

Document prefix (UTF-8 text):
above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to combine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding is well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use qi(xi) as the probability of token xi at time in the arithmetic coding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as ρLLM+AC. It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly optimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be

ρLLM+AC ≈ �NT i=1 log2 1/qi(xi) / �NT i=1 bi . (7)

Clearly, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). Hub, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind when interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.

## IV. RESULTS

We used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary of size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction with the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase letters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet is restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between these models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM. Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of LLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ algorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the paq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ or paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.

The performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average performance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the state-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the LLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I also shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by Shannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].

The dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) is shown in Table II. As expected, the compression performance improves with increasing M. We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly with the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a memory of 31 tokens.

It is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA-7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds to estimates obtained from different input sizes.

It appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset is derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.

Therefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project Gutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8 dataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset. Table IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the entropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of LLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression ratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).

To provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors, we also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the last column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm may not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the LLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.

### TABLE II  
COMPRESSION PERFORMANCE OF THE LLM ON THE TEXT8 DATASET, AS A FUNCTION OF ITS MEMORY (M)

| M

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understand the Document Prefix:** I will thoroughly read the provided document prefix to identify the main topics, existing results, and explicit mentions of future content, such as tables and section headers. I will note that the document discusses compression schemes (ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, ρLLM+AC), benchmarks using LLaMA-7B on the text8 dataset, comparisons with ZPAQ and paq8h, and mentions of Table I (fully provided), Table II (partially provided header and first column), Table III (mentioned as containing empirical mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios), and Table IV (mentioned as showing compression performance on a Project Gutenberg book). The prefix also indicates that the document is in section "IV. RESULTS", implying subsequent sections like "V. DISCUSSION", "VI. CONCLUSION", and "REFERENCES".

2. **Attempt to Locate Full Document:** To ensure I only include content supported by the tools and avoid hallucination, my primary strategy is to find the full document.
    *   I will use the `search_papers` tool with a highly specific query derived from the document prefix to maximize the chance of finding the exact paper. A suitable query would be: `query='LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character'`.
    *   If a paper is found, I will extract its `paper_id`.
    *   If the initial search fails, I will attempt a slightly broader query: `query='LLaMA-7B compression arithmetic coding text8'`.
    *   If no relevant paper is found after these attempts, I will conclude that I am "NOT READY" as I cannot fulfill the "supported by tools" constraint for retrieving *future content of this specific document*.

3. **Extract Future Content (if document found):** Assuming the full document is successfully located in step 2:
    *   I will use the `get_sections` tool with the obtained `paper_id` to retrieve a list of all sections in the document.
    *   I will identify sections that logically follow "IV. RESULTS", such as "V. DISCUSSION", "VI. CONCLUSION", "REFERENCES", and potentially "APPENDIX".
    *   For each of these identified sections, I will use the `summarize_article_section` tool (or `extract_key_facts` if `summarize_article_section` is not suitable for the content) with the `paper_id` and the `section_name` to obtain a concise summary of its content.
    *   Specifically, I will look for textual descriptions or summaries of the data that would be presented in Table II, Table III, and Table IV within the relevant sections (e.g., "RESULTS" or "DISCUSSION"). Since the tools do not directly extract tables, I will rely on the textual summaries to describe their content, including facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references.

4. **Synthesize Concise Synopsis:** I will compile all the retrieved information into a concise textual synopsis. This synopsis will focus on the likely future content, including:
    *   The full content or detailed description of Table II (compression performance as a function of LLM memory M on text8).
    *   The full content or detailed description of Table III (empirical mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios).
    *   The full content or detailed description of Table IV (compression performance on the Project Gutenberg book dataset).
    *   Key facts, discussions, and conclusions from subsequent sections (e.g., "V. DISCUSSION", "VI. CONCLUSION").
    *   The complete list of references cited in the document.
    *   Any new definitions, equations, or datasets introduced in the later parts of the document.
    *   I will ensure the synopsis is highly relevant to the document prefix and strictly adheres to the "no hallucination" and "supported by tools" constraints.

5. **Approach Challenges:**
    *   **Document Not Found:** If the full document cannot be located using `search_papers`, I will explicitly state "NOT READY" and explain that the task cannot be completed as per the "supported by tools" constraint.
    *   **Table Extraction:** As direct table extraction is not available, I will rely on the `summarize_article_section` tool to provide textual descriptions of the tables' content, focusing on the key findings and data points.
    *   **Conciseness:** I will carefully condense the extracted information to produce a synopsis that is concise and suitable for conditioning a language model compressor, avoiding redundancy.

This outcome directly aligns with the primary goal of completing the task accurately and efficiently.[00m

The transition and storing of\ncompressed multimedia data is much faster and more efficient than original\nuncompressed multimedia data. There are various techniques and standards for\nmultimedia data compression, especially for image compression such as the JPEG\nand JPEG2000 standards. These standards consist of different functions such as\ncolor space conversion and entropy coding. Arithmetic and Huffman coding are\nnormally used in the entropy coding phase. In this paper we try to answer the\nfollowing question. Which entropy coding, arithmetic or Huffman, is more\nsuitable compared to other from the compression ratio, performance, and\nimplementation points of view? We have implemented and tested Huffman and\narithmetic algorithms. Our implemented results show that compression ratio of\narithmetic coding is better than Huffman coding, while the performance of the\nHuffman coding is higher than Arithmetic coding. In addition, implementation of\nHuffman coding is much easier than the Arithmetic coding.",

Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method\nof Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence\nguarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often\nsuffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In\nthis work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally\nrepresented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks\n(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes\nand communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the\nhyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of\niterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final\niterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's\nconvergence properties.

We systematically delineate the\ndesign space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:\nparameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for\ndecay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary\nparameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus\nvector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding\nmethods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series\nof experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered\nseveral critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy\nfor decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that\neffective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of\nparameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may\ncause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly\nimpacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.\nHowever, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our\nanalysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding\nmethod, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear\nattention mechanisms.",

│  1. **Understand the Document Prefix:** I will thoroughly read the          │
│  provided document prefix to identify the main topics, existing results,    │
│  and explicit mentions of future content, such as tables and section        │
│  headers. I will note that the document discusses compression schemes       │
│  (ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, ρLLM+AC), benchmarks using LLaMA-7B on the      │

│      *   If a paper is found, I will extract its `paper_id`.                │
│      *   If the initial search fails, I will attempt a slightly broader     │
│  query: `query='LLaMA-7B compression arithmetic coding text8'`.             │
│      *   If no relevant paper is found after these attempts, I will         │
│  conclude that I am "NOT READY" as I cannot fulfill the "supported by       │

│  document is successfully located in step 2:                                │
│      *   I will use the `get_sections` tool with the obtained `paper_id`    │
│  to retrieve a list of all sections in the document.                        │
│      *   I will identify sections that logically follow "IV. RESULTS",      │

│      *   For each of these identified sections, I will use the              │
│  `summarize_article_section` tool (or `extract_key_facts` if                │
│  `summarize_article_section` is not suitable for the content) with the      │
│  `paper_id` and the `section_name` to obtain a concise summary of its       │
│  content.                                                                   │
│      *   Specifically, I will look for textual descriptions or summaries    │
│  of the data that would be presented in Table II, Table III, and Table IV   │
│  within the relevant sections (e.g., "RESULTS" or "DISCUSSION"). Since the  │
│  tools do not directly extract tables, I will rely on the textual           │
│  summaries to describe their content, including facts, equations,           │
│  definitions, datasets, and references.                                     │

│  4. **Synthesize Concise Synopsis:** I will compile all the retrieved       │
│  information into a concise textual synopsis. This synopsis will focus on   │

│      *   I will ensure the synopsis is highly relevant to the document      │
│  prefix and strictly adheres to the "no hallucination" and "supported by    │

│      *   **Document Not Found:** If the full document cannot be located     │

│  constraint.                                                                │
│      *   **Table Extraction:** As direct table extraction is not            │

Document prefix (UTF-8 text):
above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to combine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding is well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use qi(xi) as the probability of token xi at time in the arithmetic coding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as ρLLM+AC. It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly optimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be

ρLLM+AC ≈ �NT i=1 log2 1/qi(xi) / �NT i=1 bi . (7)

Clearly, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). Hub, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind when interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.

## IV. RESULTS

We used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary of size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction with the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase letters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet is restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between these models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM. Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of LLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ algorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the paq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ or paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.

The performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average performance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the state-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the LLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I also shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by Shannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].

The dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) is shown in Table II. As expected, the compression performance improves with increasing M. We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly with the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a memory of 31 tokens.

It is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA-7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds to estimates obtained from different input sizes.

It appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset is derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.

Therefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project Gutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8 dataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset. Table IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the entropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of LLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression ratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).

To provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors, we also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the last column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm may not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the LLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.

I will note that the document discusses compression schemes (ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, ρLLM+AC), benchmarks using LLaMA-7B on the text8 dataset, comparisons with ZPAQ and paq8h, and mentions of Table I (fully provided), Table II (partially provided header and first column), Table III (mentioned as containing empirical mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios), and Table IV (mentioned as showing compression performance on a Project Gutenberg book). The prefix also indicates that the document is in section "IV. RESULTS", implying subsequent sections like "V. DISCUSSION", "VI. CONCLUSION", and "REFERENCES".

2. **Attempt to Locate Full Document:** To ensure I only include content supported by the tools and avoid hallucination, my primary strategy is to find the full document.
    *   I will use the `search_papers` tool with a highly specific query derived from the document prefix to maximize the chance of finding the exact paper. A suitable query would be: `query='LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character'`.
    *   If a paper is found, I will extract its `paper_id`.
    *   If the initial search fails, I will attempt a slightly broader query: `query='LLaMA-7B compression arithmetic coding text8'`.
    *   If no relevant paper is found after these attempts, I will conclude that I am "NOT READY" as I cannot fulfill the "supported by tools" constraint for retrieving *future content of this specific document*.

3. **Extract Future Content (if document found):** Assuming the full document is successfully located in step 2:
    *   I will use the `get_sections` tool with the obtained `paper_id` to retrieve a list of all sections in the document.
    *   I will identify sections that logically follow "IV. RESULTS", such as "V. DISCUSSION", "VI. CONCLUSION", "REFERENCES", and potentially "APPENDIX".
    *   For each of these identified sections, I will use the `summarize_article_section` tool (or `extract_key_facts` if `summarize_article_section` is not suitable for the content) with the `paper_id` and the `section_name` to obtain a concise summary of its content.
    *   Specifically, I will look for textual descriptions or summaries of the data that would be presented in Table II, Table III, and Table IV within the relevant sections (e.g., "RESULTS" or "DISCUSSION"). Since the tools do not directly extract tables, I will rely on the textual summaries to describe their content, including facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references.

4. **Synthesize Concise Synopsis:** I will compile all the retrieved information into a concise textual synopsis. This synopsis will focus on the likely future content, including:
    *   The full content or detailed description of Table II (compression performance as a function of LLM memory M on text8).
    *   The full content or detailed description of Table III (empirical mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios).
    *   The full content or detailed description of Table IV (compression performance on the Project Gutenberg book dataset).
    *   Key facts, discussions, and conclusions from subsequent sections (e.g., "V. DISCUSSION", "VI. CONCLUSION").
    *   The complete list of references cited in the document.
    *   Any new definitions, equations, or datasets introduced in the later parts of the document.
    *   I will ensure the synopsis is highly relevant to the document prefix and strictly adheres to the "no hallucination" and "supported by tools" constraints.

5. **Approach Challenges:**
    *   **Document Not Found:** If the full document cannot be located using `search_papers`, I will explicitly state "NOT READY" and explain that the task cannot be completed as per the "supported by tools" constraint.
    *   **Table Extraction:** As direct table extraction is not available, I will rely on the `summarize_article_section` tool to provide textual descriptions of the tables' content, focusing on the key findings and data points.
    *   **Conciseness:** I will carefully condense the extracted information to produce a synopsis that is concise and suitable for conditioning a language model compressor, avoiding redundancy.

In this paper, we provide an in-depth\nanalysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to\nanswer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with\nneural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based\nsystems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are\nhighly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system\nusing Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with\nhuge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip -\na novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online\nmemorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely.\nFineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5\ndays, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip\noutperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin,\nimproving compression ratios by approximately 50\\%. With this work, we take the\nfirst step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While\nFineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a\nviable solution for large-scale text compression. We hope our work paves the\nway for future research and innovation to solve this problem.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, yet\ntheir deployment remains challenged by memory constraints on local devices.\nWhile scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has\nshifted from \\textit{capability} to \\textit{availability}, emphasizing the need\nfor efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as\nquantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate\ncompression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable\nmemory environments. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{BitStack}, a novel,\ntraining-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level\ntrade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight\ndecomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal\ntransmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach\niteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of\neach parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual\nblock in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in\nstorage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on\ncurrent memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks\ndemonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack\nconsistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly\nat extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndecomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical\ncompression techniques like quantization.

However, the growing cache demand\nwith increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory\nbound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing\nmethods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries\nuniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to\nrepresent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further\ncompounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model\ngeneration and deterioration of performance.

      "abstract": "Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model\ncompression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from\nresearchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the\nperformance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on\ntasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this\nblog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to\nretrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and\ncomputational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance.\nThen, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and\ntask, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same\nperformance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and\nexternal tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and\nsummarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache\ncompression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.",

      "abstract": "The ability to perform arithmetic tasks is a remarkable trait of human\nintelligence and might form a critical component of more complex reasoning\ntasks. In this work, we investigate if the surface form of a number has any\ninfluence on how sequence-to-sequence language models learn simple arithmetic\ntasks such as addition and subtraction across a wide range of values. We find\nthat how a number is represented in its surface form has a strong influence on\nthe model's accuracy. In particular, the model fails to learn addition of\nfive-digit numbers when using subwords (e.g., \"32\"), and it struggles to learn\nwith character-level representations (e.g., \"3 2\"). By introducing position\ntokens (e.g., \"3 10e1 2\"), the model learns to accurately add and subtract\nnumbers up to 60 digits. We conclude that modern pretrained language models can\neasily learn arithmetic from very few examples, as long as we use the proper\nsurface representation. This result bolsters evidence that subword tokenizers\nand positional encodings are components in current transformer designs that\nmight need improvement. Moreover, we show that regardless of the number of\nparameters and training examples, models cannot learn addition rules that are\nindependent of the length of the numbers seen during training.

Specially, we aim to enhance the coding ability\nof LLM and lead it to better teaching mode in education context. Thus, we\npropose an end-to-end prior-based three-phases supervised fine-tuned model,\nwhich is proved more competitive than traditional fine-tuning method. More\nspecifically, our model realizes the structural disassembly and incremental\nguided output of educational knowledge. To this end, we robustify data\nclassification of three types via a sampler and overlap estimation neural\nnetwork, and inject the preprocessing datasets into pre-trained model in three\nbatches for LORA fine-tuning. Then, we design a prior module couples system\nprompt, vector databases, and abstract syntax tree task segmentation. Finally,\nthe compression method and regularization constraint are applied to the\nprior-based fine-tuned model, followed by text filter at the output end to\nobtain incremental guided results. Our model represents the first research\neffort to truly embody the tutor role with the features of abundant educational\nknowledge, step-by-step incremental guided outputs and non-disclosure of\nanswers. Extensive experiments report that our model also achieves\nstate-of-the-art in code abilities compared to open-source models, reaching an\nimpressive 75.10% on the HumanEval (@pass 1) benchmark. Additionally, our model\nmaintains strong conversational capabilities, with the 13B quantized version\nachieving scores of 56.34, 50.60, and 45.27 respectively on the MMLU, C-Eval,\nand AGIEval (5 shot) dialogue evaluation benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "While language models have exceptional capabilities at text generation, they\nlack a natural inductive bias for emitting numbers and thus struggle in tasks\ninvolving quantitative reasoning, especially arithmetic. One fundamental\nlimitation is the nature of the cross-entropy (CE) loss, which assumes a\nnominal scale and thus cannot convey proximity between generated number tokens.\nIn response, we here present a regression-like loss that operates purely on\ntoken level. Our proposed Number Token Loss (NTL) comes in two flavors and\nminimizes either the $L_p$ norm or the Wasserstein distance between the\nnumerical values of the real and predicted number tokens. NTL can easily be\nadded to any language model and extend the CE objective during training without\nruntime overhead. We evaluate the proposed scheme on various mathematical\ndatasets and find that it consistently improves performance in math-related\ntasks. In a direct comparison on a regression task, we find that NTL can match\nthe performance of a regression head, despite operating on token level.\nFinally, we scale NTL up to 3B parameter models and observe improved\nperformance, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into LLMs. We\nhope to inspire LLM developers to improve their pretraining objectives and\ndistribute NTL as a minimalistic and lightweight PyPI package $ntloss$:\nhttps://github.com/ai4sd/number-token-loss.

      "abstract": "A growing trend has emerged in designing high-quality Small Language Models\n(SLMs) with a few million parameters. This trend is driven by the increasing\nconcerns over cloud costs, privacy, and latency. Considering that full\nparameter training is feasible for SLMs on mobile devices, Quantization-Aware\nTraining (QAT) is employed to improve efficiency by reducing computational\noverhead and memory footprint. However, previous QAT works adopt fine-grained\nquantization methods to compress models with billions of parameters on GPUs,\nincompatible with current commodity hardware, such as mobile and edge devices,\nwhich relies on Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions. Thus, the\ngeneralization of these methods to SLMs on mobile devices is limited. In this\npaper, we propose Squat method, an effective QAT framework with deployable\nquantization for SLMs on mobile devices. Specifically, we propose\nentropy-guided and distribution-aligned distillation to mitigate the distortion\nof attention information from quantization. Besides, we employ sub-8-bit token\nadaptive quantization, assigning varying bit widths to different tokens based\non their importance. Furthermore, we develop a SIMD-based Multi-Kernel\nMixed-Precision (MKMP) multiplier to support sub-8-bit mixed-precision MAC on\nmobile devices. Our extensive experiments verify the substantial improvements\nof our method compared to other QAT methods across various datasets.\nFurthermore, we achieve an on-device speedup of up to 2.37x compared with its\nFP16 counterparts, signaling a great advancement.

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The previous search queries did not yield the exact paper. The provided text is very specific, mentioning "LLaMA-7B", "Arithmetic Coding", "text8 dataset", specific compression ratios (0.7101 bpc), and references like [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [9], [10], [11], [12]. The fact that it mentions "LLaMA-7B [6]" and "SentencePiece tokenizer [11]" suggests these are specific references within the paper.
I will try a very targeted search using a unique phrase from the text that is less likely to appear in other papers, combined with the authors if I can find them. Since I don't have the authors yet, I'll use a very specific phrase and the arXiv category.
The phrase "LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character" is quite unique. I will try to search for this exact phrase. If that doesn't work, I will try to find the paper by searching for the title of reference [6] (LLaMA-7B) or [11] (SentencePiece tokenizer) and then looking for papers that cite them and also discuss compression.
Let's try searching for the exact phrase again, but this time I will also include the date_from parameter to narrow down the search to recent papers, as LLaMA-7B is a relatively recent model. The paper mentions "recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7]", so the paper itself must be from 2023 or later.
I will use the most specific phrase from the document prefix: "LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character". I will also add a date filter to narrow down the results to papers published after 2023-01-01, as LLaMA-7B was released in 2023.Action: search_papers[00m

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R

This suggests that the exact phrasing might not be in the abstract or title, or the paper is not indexed in arXiv in a way that makes it discoverable with such specific queries.
I need to try a different approach. The document prefix mentions several references by number, e.g., "[6]" for LLaMA-7B, "[11]" for SentencePiece tokenizer, "[5]" for ZPAQ, and "[12]" for paq8h. I can try to find the full titles of these referenced papers using a general web search, and then use those titles or authors to search for the main document.
Let's start by searching for the paper associated with "[6] LLaMA-7B" to get its full title and authors. This is a well-known model, so a general search should yield results.[00m

I will try a slightly different search query for LLaMA-7B, perhaps including "arXiv" to narrow it down to academic papers, or searching for the original LLaMA paper which would include LLaMA-7B.
Alternatively, I can try to find the paper for "SentencePiece tokenizer [11]" or "ZPAQ [5]" or "paq8h [12]". Let's try "SentencePiece tokenizer paper" first, as it's also a distinct component mentioned.[00m

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The `search` tool is consistently failing to return results, which is preventing me from finding the full document. This is a critical blocker. Given that the tool description mentions "DuckDuckGo's bot detection or the query returned no matches", it's possible there's an issue with the `search` tool itself or how it's being called.
Since I cannot use the `search` tool effectively, I need to reconsider my strategy for finding the paper. I cannot directly search for the paper on arXiv without a more precise query or an arXiv ID. The document prefix itself is the only source of information I have.
I will try one more time with `search_papers` using a combination of keywords that are highly likely to be in the abstract or title, but less specific than the exact compression ratio. I will combine "LLaMA-7B", "arithmetic coding", "text8", and "compression". I will also try to sort by date to see if a recent paper matches.[00m

Previous\nmethods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time\nperformance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism\nthat ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,\nthereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large\ncomputation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and\nmaintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera\npose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to\nachieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,\ncamera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive\nexperiments on diverse datasets.

Traditional\nmanual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields\nsuboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount\nof parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to\nseasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning\nframework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges\nof multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key\ncontributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning\ntask: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters\nto maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn\nan optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to\nestimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high\nvariance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT\nthrough an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared\nto the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the\nclick-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the\ntreated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of\ndifferent reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the\nlearned policy model.",

To bridge this gap and better understand\nmodel training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and\nalign features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the\nevolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders\nbetween open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and\nrepresentation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects\n(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally\nimportant for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature\nemergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining.

Relational hyper-event models (RHEMs) aim to explain the dynamics of\nthese events by modeling the event rate as a function of statistics based on\npast history and external information.\n  However, despite the complexity of the data, most current RHEM approaches\nstill rely on a linearity assumption to model this relationship. In this work,\nwe address this limitation by introducing a more flexible model that allows the\neffects of statistics to vary non-linearly and over time. While time-varying\nand non-linear effects have been used in relational event modeling, we take\nthis further by modeling joint time-varying and non-linear effects using tensor\nproduct smooths.\n  We validate our methodology on both synthetic and empirical data. In\nparticular, we use RHEMs to study how patterns of scientific collaboration and\nimpact evolve over time. Our approach provides deeper insights into the dynamic\nfactors driving relational hyper-events, allowing us to evaluate potential\nnon-monotonic patterns that cannot be identified using linear models.",

We systematically delineate the\ndesign space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:\nparameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for\ndecay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary\nparameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus\nvector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding\nmethods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series\nof experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered\nseveral critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy\nfor decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that\neffective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of\nparameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may\ncause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly\nimpacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.\nHowever, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our\nanalysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding\nmethod, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear\nattention mechanisms.",

Building\nlarge models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and\nefficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of\nbrain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and\ninference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three\naspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention\narchitectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an\nefficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding\nframework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator\nlibraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.\n  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,\nand SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the\nfeasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.\nSpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer\nbaselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our\nmodels significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver\ninference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.\nFor example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token\nfor 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX\nC550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4\npercent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling\nlow-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of\nbrain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and\nscalable large model design.",

      "abstract": "The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have\nraised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training\nlarge-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning\nperformance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse\ngas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.\nIn this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy\nconsumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,\nARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each\nalgorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and\npower consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,\nCO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national\naverage electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy\nefficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable\nperformance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting\nnearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.\nRecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the\ntrade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and\nfinancial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate\nenvironmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.\nThis study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and\ncost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating\nsustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.",

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work
