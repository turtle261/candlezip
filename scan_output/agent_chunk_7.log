Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

−1/n log2 pSn(S1, . . . , Sn) = −1/n log2 pSn(Sn) → H(S) almost surely. (2)

Let ΩS be the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem implies

−1/i log2 pXi(X1, . . . , Xi) = −1/i log2 pXi(Xi) → H(X) almost surely. (3)

Define ΩX as the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have

lim i→∞ mi(S)/i = E [B] almost surely. (4)

Set ΩB to be the set of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. For any ω ∈ΩS ∩ ΩX ∩ ΩB, we deduce that

H(S) = lim k→∞ −1/k log2 pSk(Sk(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 pSli(Sli(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 Pr (Xi = T (Sli(ω)))

= −1/E[B] lim i→∞ 1/i log2 Pr (Xi = xi) = H(X)/E[B] .

The first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {li = mi(S(ω))|i ∈N} is an infinite subset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately gather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following two events, {ω ∈Ω|Xi(ω) = xi} = {ω ∈Ω|T (Smi(S(ω))) = xi}. This is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step holds because we are considering an ω ∈ΩB. The sets ΩS, ΩX, and ΩB each have probability one; this implies that their intersection also has

Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the task:** The task requires me to act as a deterministic research agent. Given a document prefix, I need to predict and summarize the likely future content of the same document. This synopsis should be concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. I must strictly use the provided tools to retrieve information and avoid any hallucination. The document appears to be a research paper on compression techniques using language models, with a focus on rank-based and probability-based encoding, and an upcoming discussion on entropy bounds.

2. **Key steps to complete the task:**

The prefix explicitly mentions "Section III-B3" and "Fig. 4", and has a subsection titled "A. Entropy bounds".
    * **Identify the document:** Since the task is to retrieve information *from the same document*, the first step is to identify and locate the full document. I will use keywords from the prefix to search for the paper.
    * **Access relevant sections:** Once the document is identified, I will use tools to access the content of "Section III-B3" and any further details related to "Entropy bounds" and "Fig. 4".
    * **Extract and synthesize information:** From the accessed sections, I will extract key facts, equations, definitions, and any other relevant information.
    * **Formulate the synopsis:** Combine the extracted information into a concise textual synopsis, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future content and adheres to the non-hallucination constraint.

3. **Approach to challenges:**
    * **Identifying the specific paper:** The prefix does not provide a title or authors. I will use highly specific phrases from the text, such as "COMPRESSION USING LLMS", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and "entropy bounds" to search for the paper. If a direct match isn't found, I will broaden the search slightly while maintaining relevance.
    * **Ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucination:** I will only include information that is explicitly retrieved from the tools. If a tool cannot provide specific details for a mentioned section or concept, I will not invent it.
    * **Conciseness:** I will focus on extracting the most salient points and summarizing them efficiently, avoiding verbose descriptions.

4. **Strategic use of available tools:**
    * **`search_papers(query: str)`:** I will start by using this tool with a query like "compression using LLMs encoding ranks arithmetic coding entropy bounds" or similar combinations derived from the prefix to find the specific research paper.

    * **`get_sections(paper_id: str)`:** This tool will be crucial to directly navigate to "Section III-B3" and any subsequent sections related to "Entropy bounds" or "Fig. 4" once the paper is identified.
    * **`extract_key_facts(text: str)` or `summarize_article_section(text: str, query: str)`:** After retrieving the content of the relevant sections, I will use these tools to extract the core information needed for the synopsis. `extract_key_facts` seems more appropriate for pulling out specific details like equations, definitions, and facts.

5. **Expected outcome:** A concise textual synopsis detailing the likely future content of the document. This will include:
    * Further elaboration on "Section III-B3" regarding "better compression... by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding."
    * More in-depth discussion and mathematical formulations related to "Entropy bounds" (Section III-A).
    * Details and explanations pertaining to "Fig. 4", which is described as "Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i."
    * Any other definitions, equations, or factual information that logically follows from the provided prefix and can be retrieved using the tools.

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The previous searches were still too specific or did not yield results. The document prefix clearly describes a method for compressing sequences using language models, involving ranks and probabilities, and then moves into entropy bounds. I will try a more general search focusing on "language model compression" and "entropy" to see if I can find relevant papers. If I find a paper that seems to match the description, I will then download it and try to locate the specific sections mentioned.[00m

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work

│  1. **Understanding of the task:** The task requires me to act as a         │
│  deterministic research agent. Given a document prefix, I need to predict   │
│  and summarize the likely future content of the same document. This         │
│  synopsis should be concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a       │
│  language model compressor. I must strictly use the provided tools to       │
│  retrieve information and avoid any hallucination. The document appears to  │
│  be a research paper on compression techniques using language models, with  │
│  a focus on rank-based and probability-based encoding, and an upcoming      │
│  discussion on entropy bounds.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key steps to complete the task:**                                     │
│      * **Analyze the prefix:** Carefully read the provided document prefix  │
│  to identify explicit mentions of future sections, figures, and key         │
│  concepts that are likely to be elaborated upon. The prefix explicitly      │
│  mentions "Section III-B3" and "Fig. 4", and has a subsection titled "A.    │
│  Entropy bounds".                                                           │
│      * **Identify the document:** Since the task is to retrieve             │
│  information *from the same document*, the first step is to identify and    │
│  locate the full document. I will use keywords from the prefix to search    │
│  for the paper.                                                             │
│      * **Access relevant sections:** Once the document is identified, I     │
│  will use tools to access the content of "Section III-B3" and any further   │
│  details related to "Entropy bounds" and "Fig. 4".                          │
│      * **Extract and synthesize information:** From the accessed sections,  │
│  I will extract key facts, equations, definitions, and any other relevant   │
│  information.                                                               │
│      * **Formulate the synopsis:** Combine the extracted information into   │
│  a concise textual synopsis, ensuring it directly addresses the likely      │
│  future content and adheres to the non-hallucination constraint.            │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to challenges:**                                             │
│      * **Identifying the specific paper:** The prefix does not provide a    │
│  title or authors. I will use highly specific phrases from the text, such   │
│  as "compression using LLMs", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and    │
│  "entropy bounds" to search for the paper. If a direct match isn't found,   │
│  I will broaden the search slightly while maintaining relevance.            │
│      * **Ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucination:** I will only        │
│  include information that is explicitly retrieved from the tools. If a      │
│  tool cannot provide specific details for a mentioned section or concept,   │
│  I will not invent it.                                                      │
│      * **Conciseness:** I will focus on extracting the most salient points  │
│  and summarizing them efficiently, avoiding verbose descriptions.           │
│                                                                             │

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

−1/n log2 pSn(S1, . . . , Sn) = −1/n log2 pSn(Sn) → H(S) almost surely. (2)

Let ΩS be the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem implies

−1/i log2 pXi(X1, . . . , Xi) = −1/i log2 pXi(Xi) → H(X) almost surely. (3)

Define ΩX as the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have

lim i→∞ mi(S)/i = E [B] almost surely. (4)

Set ΩB to be the set of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. For any ω ∈ΩS ∩ ΩX ∩ ΩB, we deduce that

H(S) = lim k→∞ −1/k log2 pSk(Sk(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 pSli(Sli(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 Pr (Xi = T (Sli(ω)))

= −1/E[B] lim i→∞ 1/i log2 Pr (Xi = xi) = H(X)/E[B] .

The first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {li = mi(S(ω))|i ∈N} is an infinite subset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately gather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following two events, {ω ∈Ω|Xi(ω) = xi} = {ω ∈Ω|T (Smi(S(ω))) = xi}. This is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step holds because we are considering an ω ∈ΩB. The sets ΩS, ΩX, and ΩB each have probability one; this implies that their intersection also has

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the task:** The task requires me to act as a deterministic research agent. Given a document prefix, I need to predict and summarize the likely future content of the same document. This synopsis should be concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. I must strictly use the provided tools to retrieve information and avoid any hallucination. The document appears to be a research paper on compression techniques using language models, with a focus on rank-based and probability-based encoding, and an upcoming discussion on entropy bounds.

2. **Key steps to complete the task:**
    * **Analyze the prefix:** Carefully read the provided document prefix to identify explicit mentions of future sections, figures, and key concepts that are likely to be elaborated upon. The prefix explicitly mentions "Section III-B3" and "Fig. 4", and has a subsection titled "A. Entropy bounds".
    * **Identify the document:** Since the task is to retrieve information *from the same document*, the first step is to identify and locate the full document. I will use keywords from the prefix to search for the paper.
    * **Access relevant sections:** Once the document is identified, I will use tools to access the content of "Section III-B3" and any further details related to "Entropy bounds" and "Fig. 4".
    * **Extract and synthesize information:** From the accessed sections, I will extract key facts, equations, definitions, and any other relevant information.
    * **Formulate the synopsis:** Combine the extracted information into a concise textual synopsis, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future content and adheres to the non-hallucination constraint.

3. **Approach to challenges:**
    * **Identifying the specific paper:** The prefix does not provide a title or authors. I will use highly specific phrases from the text, such as "COMPRESSION USING LLMS", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and "entropy bounds" to search for the paper. If a direct match isn't found, I will broaden the search slightly while maintaining relevance.
    * **Ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucination:** I will only include information that is explicitly retrieved from the tools. If a tool cannot provide specific details for a mentioned section or concept, I will not invent it.
    * **Conciseness:** I will focus on extracting the most salient points and summarizing them efficiently, avoiding verbose descriptions.

4. **Strategic use of available tools:**
    * **`search_papers(query: str)`:** I will start by using this tool with a query like "compression using LLMs encoding ranks arithmetic coding entropy bounds" or similar combinations derived from the prefix to find the specific research paper.
    * **`download_paper(paper_id: str)` or `read_paper(paper_id: str)`:** Once the paper is identified (via `paper_id` from `search_papers`), I will use one of these to get access to the full content. `read_paper` might be more suitable if I need to read specific sections.
    * **`get_sections(paper_id: str)`:** This tool will be crucial to directly navigate to "Section III-B3" and any subsequent sections related to "Entropy bounds" or "Fig. 4" once the paper is identified.
    * **`extract_key_facts(text: str)` or `summarize_article_section(text: str, query: str)`:** After retrieving the content of the relevant sections, I will use these tools to extract the core information needed for the synopsis. `extract_key_facts` seems more appropriate for pulling out specific details like equations, definitions, and facts.

5. **Expected outcome:** A concise textual synopsis detailing the likely future content of the document. This will include:
    * Further elaboration on "Section III-B3" regarding "better compression... by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding."
    * More in-depth discussion and mathematical formulations related to "Entropy bounds" (Section III-A).
    * Details and explanations pertaining to "Fig. 4", which is described as "Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i."
    * Any other definitions, equations, or factual information that logically follows from the provided prefix and can be retrieved using the tools.

In the commonly studied scenario of classification from compressed\nimages, a key objective is to enable learning directly on entropy-coded data,\nthereby bypassing the computationally intensive step of data reconstruction.\nConventional entropy-coding methods, such as Huffman and Arithmetic coding, are\neffective for compression but disrupt the data structure, making them less\nsuitable for direct learning without decoding. This paper investigates the use\nof low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes -- originally designed for channel\ncoding -- as an alternative entropy-coding approach. It is hypothesized that\nthe structured nature of LDPC codes can be leveraged more effectively by deep\nlearning models for tasks like classification. At the receiver side, gated\nrecurrent unit (GRU) models are trained to perform image classification\ndirectly on LDPC-coded data. Experiments on datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST,\nand CIFAR show that LDPC codes outperform Huffman and Arithmetic coding in\nclassification tasks, while requiring significantly smaller learning models.\nFurthermore, the paper analyzes why LDPC codes preserve data structure more\neffectively than traditional entropy-coding techniques and explores the impact\nof key code parameters on classification performance. These results suggest\nthat LDPC-based entropy coding offers an optimal balance between learning\nefficiency and model complexity, eliminating the need for prior decoding.",

Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) An\noften-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt\nselection approach, 2) The combination of the optimized distribution and the\nvocabulary truncation technique is considered, and 3) The combination of the\noptimized distribution with other sequence-level selection heuristics to\nfurther enhance the efficiency and reliability is studied.",

      "abstract": "In goal-oriented communications, the objective of the receiver is often to\napply a Deep-Learning model, rather than reconstructing the original data. In\nthis context, direct learning over compressed data, without any prior decoding,\nholds promise for enhancing the time-efficient execution of inference models at\nthe receiver. However, conventional entropic-coding methods like Huffman and\nArithmetic break data structure, rendering them unsuitable for learning without\ndecoding. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach in which entropic\ncoding is realized with Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes. We hypothesize\nthat Deep Learning models can more effectively exploit the internal code\nstructure of LDPC codes. At the receiver, we leverage a specific class of\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),\ntrained for image classification. Our numerical results indicate that\nclassification based on LDPC-coded bit-planes surpasses Huffman and Arithmetic\ncoding, while necessitating a significantly smaller learning model. This\ndemonstrates the efficiency of classification directly from LDPC-coded data,\neliminating the need for any form of decompression, even partial, prior to\napplying the learning model.",

The titles are related to deep neural network compression, arithmetic coding, and LLMs, but none explicitly mention "encoding ranks" in the way the prefix describes it, nor do they seem to be the exact document.
The prefix describes a method of compressing sequences of ranks or probabilities generated by an LLM. The most relevant terms from the prefix are "compression using LLMs", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and "entropy bounds".
Let's try a more focused search using a very specific phrase from the document prefix, like "compression using LLMs" and "encoding ranks" to see if we can find the exact paper. If that doesn't work, I will try to broaden the search for papers discussing "language model compression" and "entropy bounds" to see if I can find a paper that discusses these concepts in a similar structure.
Given the detailed description of the method and the specific section headings, it's likely a very specific paper. I will try to search for the exact phrase "COMPRESSION USING LLMS" as a title or a very prominent part of the paper.
Let's try a more direct search for the title or a very specific phrase from the document. The section title "III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS" is quite distinctive. I will try to search for papers with this phrase in their title or abstract.[00m

By contrast, systems such as causal models, that learn abstract\nvariables and causal relationships, can demonstrate increased robustness\nagainst changes in the distribution. One reason for this success is the\nexistence and use of Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICMs) representing\nhigh-level concepts that only sparsely interact. In this work, we apply two\nconcepts from causality to learn ICMs within LLMs. We develop a new LLM\narchitecture composed of multiple sparsely interacting language modelling\nmodules. We show that such causal constraints can improve out-of-distribution\nperformance on abstract and causal reasoning tasks. We also investigate the\nlevel of independence and domain specialisation and show that LLMs rely on\npre-trained partially domain-invariant mechanisms resilient to fine-tuning.",

Thus, it has\nbeen argued that prediction of upcoming words is a key component of language\ncomprehension, and that studying the amplitude of the N400 is a valuable way to\ninvestigate the predictions we make. In this study, we investigate whether the\nlinguistic predictions of computational language models or humans better\nreflect the way in which natural language stimuli modulate the amplitude of the\nN400. One important difference in the linguistic predictions of humans versus\ncomputational language models is that while language models base their\npredictions exclusively on the preceding linguistic context, humans may rely on\nother factors. We find that the predictions of three top-of-the-line\ncontemporary language models - GPT-3, RoBERTa, and ALBERT - match the N400 more\nclosely than human predictions. This suggests that the predictive processes\nunderlying the N400 may be more sensitive to the surface-level statistics of\nlanguage than previously thought.",

We find a high degree\nof redundancy between the information carried by the words and prosodic\ninformation across several prosodic features, including intensity, duration,\npauses, and pitch contours. Furthermore, a word's prosodic information is\nredundant with both the word itself and the context preceding as well as\nfollowing it.

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The previous search using "ti:\"COMPRESSION USING LLMS\" OR abs:\"COMPRESSION USING LLMS\" AND \"encoding ranks\" AND \"arithmetic coding\"" did not yield the exact paper. The paper "Language Modeling Is Compression" (2309.10668v2) is highly relevant in its title and abstract, discussing the prediction-compression equivalence and compression capabilities of LLMs. However, it doesn't explicitly mention "encoding ranks" as a primary method or the specific section structure (III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS, III.A. Entropy bounds, III-B3).
The document prefix clearly describes a method where ranks of predicted words are compressed, and then mentions that "better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3." This suggests a paper that details both rank-based and probability-based compression using LLMs, with a strong emphasis on information theory and entropy bounds.
Let's try a more general search for "language model compression" and "entropy bounds" and "arithmetic coding", and then manually inspect the abstracts for mentions of "ranks" or "probabilities" in the context of compression. The paper "Language Modeling Is Compression" (2309.10668v2) is a strong candidate, so I will keep it in mind.
I will try to search for the exact phrase "encoding ranks" in conjunction with "language model compression" and "arithmetic coding".[00m

      "abstract": "More predictable words are easier to process - they are read faster and\nelicit smaller neural signals associated with processing difficulty, most\nnotably, the N400 component of the event-related brain potential. Thus, it has\nbeen argued that prediction of upcoming words is a key component of language\ncomprehension, and that studying the amplitude of the N400 is a valuable way to\ninvestigate the predictions we make. In this study, we investigate whether the\nlinguistic predictions of computational language models or humans better\nreflect the way in which natural language stimuli modulate the amplitude of the\nN400. One important difference in the linguistic predictions of humans versus\ncomputational language models is that while language models base their\npredictions exclusively on the preceding linguistic context, humans may rely on\nother factors. We find that the predictions of three top-of-the-line\ncontemporary language models - GPT-3, RoBERTa, and ALBERT - match the N400 more\nclosely than human predictions. This suggests that the predictive processes\nunderlying the N400 may be more sensitive to the surface-level statistics of\nlanguage than previously thought.",

When a few keywords per topic are provided, vONTSS in the\nsemi-supervised setting generates potential topics and optimizes topic-keyword\nquality and topic classification. Experiments show that vONTSS outperforms\nexisting semi-supervised topic modeling methods in classification accuracy and\ndiversity. vONTSS also supports unsupervised topic modeling. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments show that vONTSS in the unsupervised setting\noutperforms recent NTMs on multiple aspects: vONTSS discovers highly clustered\nand coherent topics on benchmark datasets.

Incidentally, in recent years, the machine\nlearning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful\nself-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit\nimpressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong\ncompressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem\nthrough the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of\nlarge (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful\ngeneral-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel\ninsights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example,\nChinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to\n43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, beating\ndomain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%), respectively.\nFinally, we show that the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use\nany compressor (like gzip) to build a conditional generative model.",

We use large language models (LLMs) to estimate how much\ninformation is redundant between prosody and the words themselves. Using a\nlarge spoken corpus of English audiobooks, we extract prosodic features aligned\nto individual words and test how well they can be predicted from LLM\nembeddings, compared to non-contextual word embeddings. We find a high degree\nof redundancy between the information carried by the words and prosodic\ninformation across several prosodic features, including intensity, duration,\npauses, and pitch contours. Furthermore, a word's prosodic information is\nredundant with both the word itself and the context preceding as well as\nfollowing it. Still, we observe that prosodic features can not be fully\npredicted from text, suggesting that prosody carries information above and\nbeyond the words.

Despite such appealing\ndiscussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between\ncompression and intelligence. In this work, we examine their relationship in\nthe context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract\nconcept of \"intelligence\", we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as\na surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and\ncommonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our\nstudy brings together 31 public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations.\nRemarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence -- reflected by average benchmark\nscores -- almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external\ntext corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief\nthat superior compression indicates greater intelligence.

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work

│  1. **Understanding of the task:** The task requires me to act as a         │
│  deterministic research agent. Given a document prefix, I need to predict   │
│  and summarize the likely future content of the same document. This         │
│  synopsis should be concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a       │
│  language model compressor. I must strictly use the provided tools to       │
│  retrieve information and avoid any hallucination. The document appears to  │
│  be a research paper on compression techniques using language models, with  │
│  a focus on rank-based and probability-based encoding, and an upcoming      │
│  discussion on entropy bounds.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key steps to complete the task:**                                     │
│      * **Analyze the prefix:** Carefully read the provided document prefix  │
│  to identify explicit mentions of future sections, figures, and key         │
│  concepts that are likely to be elaborated upon. The prefix explicitly      │
│  mentions "Section III-B3" and "Fig. 4", and has a subsection titled "A.    │
│  Entropy bounds".                                                           │
│      * **Identify the document:** Since the task is to retrieve             │
│  information *from the same document*, the first step is to identify and    │
│  locate the full document. I will use keywords from the prefix to search    │
│  for the paper.                                                             │
│      * **Access relevant sections:** Once the document is identified, I     │
│  will use tools to access the content of "Section III-B3" and any further   │
│  details related to "Entropy bounds" and "Fig. 4".                          │
│      * **Extract and synthesize information:** From the accessed sections,  │
│  I will extract key facts, equations, definitions, and any other relevant   │
│  information.                                                               │
│      * **Formulate the synopsis:** Combine the extracted information into   │
│  a concise textual synopsis, ensuring it directly addresses the likely      │
│  future content and adheres to the non-hallucination constraint.            │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to challenges:**                                             │
│      * **Identifying the specific paper:** The prefix does not provide a    │
│  title or authors. I will use highly specific phrases from the text, such   │
│  as "COMPRESSION USING LLMS", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and    │
│  "entropy bounds" to search for the paper. If a direct match isn't found,   │
│  I will broaden the search slightly while maintaining relevance.            │
│      * **Ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucination:** I will only        │
│  include information that is explicitly retrieved from the tools. If a      │
│  tool cannot provide specific details for a mentioned section or concept,   │
│  I will not invent it.                                                      │
│      * **Conciseness:** I will focus on extracting the most salient points  │
│  and summarizing them efficiently, avoiding verbose descriptions.           │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic use of available tools:**                                   │
│      * **`search_papers(query: str)`:** I will start by using this tool     │
│  with a query like "compression using LLMs encoding ranks arithmetic        │
│  coding entropy bounds" or similar combinations derived from the prefix to  │
│  find the specific research paper.                                          │
│      * **`download_paper(paper_id: str)` or `read_paper(paper_id: str)`:**  │
│  Once the paper is identified (via `paper_id` from `search_papers`), I      │
│  will use one of these to get access to the full content. `read_paper`      │
│  might be more suitable if I need to read specific sections.                │
│      * **`get_sections(paper_id: str)`:** This tool will be crucial to      │
│  directly navigate to "Section III-B3" and any subsequent sections related  │
│  to "Entropy bounds" or "Fig. 4" once the paper is identified.              │
│      * **`extract_key_facts(text: str)` or                                  │
│  `summarize_article_section(text: str, query: str)`:** After retrieving     │
│  the content of the relevant sections, I will use these tools to extract    │
│  the core information needed for the synopsis. `extract_key_facts` seems    │
│  more appropriate for pulling out specific details like equations,          │
│  definitions, and facts.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected outcome:** A concise textual synopsis detailing the likely   │
│  future content of the document. This will include:                         │
│      * Further elaboration on "Section III-B3" regarding "better            │
│  compression... by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM     │
│  along with arithmetic coding."                                             │
│      * More in-depth discussion and mathematical formulations related to    │
│  "Entropy bounds" (Section III-A).                                          │
│      * Details and explanations pertaining to "Fig. 4", which is described  │
│  as "Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i."                          │
│      * Any other definitions, equations, or factual information that        │
│  logically follows from the provided prefix and can be retrieved using the  │
│  tools.                                                                     │

[95m## Task:[00m [92mYou act as a deterministic research agent. Given the observed prefix of a document, use available MCP tools to retrieve information that is likely to appear later in the same document. Prefer authoritative sources. Produce a concise textual synopsis of the likely future content (facts, equations, definitions, datasets, references), suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. Maximize relevance to the document. Do not hallucinate; only include content supported by the tools.

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |

| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

−1/n log2 pSn(S1, . . . , Sn) = −1/n log2 pSn(Sn) → H(S) almost surely. (2)

Let ΩS be the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem implies

−1/i log2 pXi(X1, . . . , Xi) = −1/i log2 pXi(Xi) → H(X) almost surely. (3)

Define ΩX as the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have

lim i→∞ mi(S)/i = E [B] almost surely. (4)

Set ΩB to be the set of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. For any ω ∈ΩS ∩ ΩX ∩ ΩB, we deduce that

H(S) = lim k→∞ −1/k log2 pSk(Sk(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 pSli(Sli(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 Pr (Xi = T (Sli(ω)))

= −1/E[B] lim i→∞ 1/i log2 Pr (Xi = xi) = H(X)/E[B] .

The first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {li = mi(S(ω))|i ∈N} is an infinite subset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately gather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following two events, {ω ∈Ω|Xi(ω) = xi} = {ω ∈Ω|T (Smi(S(ω))) = xi}. This is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step holds because we are considering an ω ∈ΩB. The sets ΩS, ΩX, and ΩB each have probability one; this implies that their intersection also has

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the task:** The task requires me to act as a deterministic research agent. Given a document prefix, I need to predict and summarize the likely future content of the same document. This synopsis should be concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. I must strictly use the provided tools to retrieve information and avoid any hallucination. The document appears to be a research paper on compression techniques using language models, with a focus on rank-based and probability-based encoding, and an upcoming discussion on entropy bounds.

2. **Key steps to complete the task:**
    * **Analyze the prefix:** Carefully read the provided document prefix to identify explicit mentions of future sections, figures, and key concepts that are likely to be elaborated upon. The prefix explicitly mentions "Section III-B3" and "Fig. 4", and has a subsection titled "A. Entropy bounds".
    * **Identify the document:** Since the task is to retrieve information *from the same document*, the first step is to identify and locate the full document. I will use keywords from the prefix to search for the paper.
    * **Access relevant sections:** Once the document is identified, I will use tools to access the content of "Section III-B3" and any further details related to "Entropy bounds" and "Fig. 4".
    * **Extract and synthesize information:** From the accessed sections, I will extract key facts, equations, definitions, and any other relevant information.
    * **Formulate the synopsis:** Combine the extracted information into a concise textual synopsis, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future content and adheres to the non-hallucination constraint.

3. **Approach to challenges:**
    * **Identifying the specific paper:** The prefix does not provide a title or authors. I will use highly specific phrases from the text, such as "COMPRESSION USING LLMS", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and "entropy bounds" to search for the paper. If a direct match isn't found, I will broaden the search slightly while maintaining relevance.
    * **Ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucination:** I will only include information that is explicitly retrieved from the tools. If a tool cannot provide specific details for a mentioned section or concept, I will not invent it.
    * **Conciseness:** I will focus on extracting the most salient points and summarizing them efficiently, avoiding verbose descriptions.

4. **Strategic use of available tools:**
    * **`search_papers(query: str)`:** I will start by using this tool with a query like "compression using LLMs encoding ranks arithmetic coding entropy bounds" or similar combinations derived from the prefix to find the specific research paper.
    * **`download_paper(paper_id: str)` or `read_paper(paper_id: str)`:** Once the paper is identified (via `paper_id` from `search_papers`), I will use one of these to get access to the full content. `read_paper` might be more suitable if I need to read specific sections.
    * **`get_sections(paper_id: str)`:** This tool will be crucial to directly navigate to "Section III-B3" and any subsequent sections related to "Entropy bounds" or "Fig. 4" once the paper is identified.
    * **`extract_key_facts(text: str)` or `summarize_article_section(text: str, query: str)`:** After retrieving the content of the relevant sections, I will use these tools to extract the core information needed for the synopsis. `extract_key_facts` seems more appropriate for pulling out specific details like equations, definitions, and facts.

5. **Expected outcome:** A concise textual synopsis detailing the likely future content of the document. This will include:
    * Further elaboration on "Section III-B3" regarding "better compression... by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding."
    * More in-depth discussion and mathematical formulations related to "Entropy bounds" (Section III-A).
    * Details and explanations pertaining to "Fig. 4", which is described as "Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i."
    * Any other definitions, equations, or factual information that logically follows from the provided prefix and can be retrieved using the tools.

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work

[95m## Task:[00m [92mYou act as a deterministic research agent. Given the observed prefix of a document, use available MCP tools to retrieve information that is likely to appear later in the same document. Prefer authoritative sources.

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

−1/n log2 pSn(S1, . . . , Sn) = −1/n log2 pSn(Sn) → H(S) almost surely. (2)

Let ΩS be the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem implies

−1/i log2 pXi(X1, . . . , Xi) = −1/i log2 pXi(Xi) → H(X) almost surely. (3)

Define ΩX as the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have

lim i→∞ mi(S)/i = E [B] almost surely. (4)

Set ΩB to be the set of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. For any ω ∈ΩS ∩ ΩX ∩ ΩB, we deduce that

H(S) = lim k→∞ −1/k log2 pSk(Sk(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 pSli(Sli(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 Pr (Xi = T (Sli(ω)))

= −1/E[B] lim i→∞ 1/i log2 Pr (Xi = xi) = H(X)/E[B] .

The first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {li = mi(S(ω))|i ∈N} is an infinite subset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately gather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following two events, {ω ∈Ω|Xi(ω) = xi} = {ω ∈Ω|T (Smi(S(ω))) = xi}. This is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step holds because we are considering an ω ∈ΩB. The sets ΩS, ΩX, and ΩB each have probability one; this implies that their intersection also has

Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the task:** The task requires me to act as a deterministic research agent. Given a document prefix, I need to predict and summarize the likely future content of the same document. This synopsis should be concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. I must strictly use the provided tools to retrieve information and avoid any hallucination. The document appears to be a research paper on compression techniques using language models, with a focus on rank-based and probability-based encoding, and an upcoming discussion on entropy bounds.

2. **Key steps to complete the task:**
    * **Analyze the prefix:** Carefully read the provided document prefix to identify explicit mentions of future sections, figures, and key concepts that are likely to be elaborated upon. The prefix explicitly mentions "Section III-B3" and "Fig. 4", and has a subsection titled "A. Entropy bounds".
    * **Identify the document:** Since the task is to retrieve information *from the same document*, the first step is to identify and locate the full document. I will use keywords from the prefix to search for the paper.
    * **Access relevant sections:** Once the document is identified, I will use tools to access the content of "Section III-B3" and any further details related to "Entropy bounds" and "Fig. 4".
    * **Extract and synthesize information:** From the accessed sections, I will extract key facts, equations, definitions, and any other relevant information.
    * **Formulate the synopsis:** Combine the extracted information into a concise textual synopsis, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future content and adheres to the non-hallucination constraint.

3. **Approach to challenges:**
    * **Identifying the specific paper:** The prefix does not provide a title or authors. I will use highly specific phrases from the text, such as "COMPRESSION USING LLMS", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and "entropy bounds" to search for the paper. If a direct match isn't found, I will broaden the search slightly while maintaining relevance.
    * **Ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucination:** I will only include information that is explicitly retrieved from the tools. If a tool cannot provide specific details for a mentioned section or concept, I will not invent it.
    * **Conciseness:** I will focus on extracting the most salient points and summarizing them efficiently, avoiding verbose descriptions.

4. **Strategic use of available tools:**
    * **`search_papers(query: str)`:** I will start by using this tool with a query like "compression using LLMs encoding ranks arithmetic coding entropy bounds" or similar combinations derived from the prefix to find the specific research paper.
    * **`download_paper(paper_id: str)` or `read_paper(paper_id: str)`:** Once the paper is identified (via `paper_id` from `search_papers`), I will use one of these to get access to the full content. `read_paper` might be more suitable if I need to read specific sections.
    * **`get_sections(paper_id: str)`:** This tool will be crucial to directly navigate to "Section III-B3" and any subsequent sections related to "Entropy bounds" or "Fig. 4" once the paper is identified.
    * **`extract_key_facts(text: str)` or `summarize_article_section(text: str, query: str)`:** After retrieving the content of the relevant sections, I will use these tools to extract the core information needed for the synopsis. `extract_key_facts` seems more appropriate for pulling out specific details like equations, definitions, and facts.

5. **Expected outcome:** A concise textual synopsis detailing the likely future content of the document. This will include:
    * Further elaboration on "Section III-B3" regarding "better compression... by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding."

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The user wants me to predict and summarize the future content of the provided document prefix. The prefix clearly indicates that the document is a research paper discussing compression using Language Models (LLMs), specifically mentioning rank-based and probability-based encoding, arithmetic coding, and entropy bounds. It also refers to "Section III-B3" and "Fig. 4".
My strategy will be:
1.  **Identify the paper**: Use `search_papers` with a specific query derived from the document prefix to find the arXiv paper. Keywords like "compression using LLMs", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and "entropy bounds" should be effective.
2.  **Download the paper**: Once the paper ID is found, use `download_paper` to get the full content.
3.  **Locate and read relevant sections**: The prefix explicitly mentions "Section III-B3" and "Section III-A. Entropy bounds". I will read these sections and any content related to "Fig. 4" using `read_paper`.
4.  **Extract key information**: From the retrieved sections, I will extract facts, equations, definitions, and descriptions of figures to form the synopsis.
Let's start by searching for the paper. I will use a query that combines the most distinctive technical terms from the prefix.Action: search_papers[00m

Unfortunately, most current deep networks are enormous\ncloud-based structures that require significant storage space, which limits\nscaling of deep learning as a service (DLaaS) and use for on-device\nintelligence. This paper is concerned with finding universal lossless\ncompressed representations of deep feedforward networks with synaptic weights\ndrawn from discrete sets, and directly performing inference without full\ndecompression. The basic insight that allows less rate than naive approaches is\nrecognizing that the bipartite graph layers of feedforward networks have a kind\nof permutation invariance to the labeling of nodes, in terms of inferential\noperation. We provide efficient algorithms to dissipate this irrelevant\nuncertainty and then use arithmetic coding to nearly achieve the entropy bound\nin a universal manner.

Using a manually designed context-free grammar (CFG)\nto generate a large-scale dataset of sentences related to the content of\nrealistic 3D indoor scenes, we evaluate the language coverage and\ngeneralization abilities of the most common continuous sentence embeddings\nbased on RNNs. We also propose a new embedding method based on arithmetic\ncoding, AriEL, that is not data-driven and that efficiently encodes in\ncontinuous space any sentence from the CFG. We find that RNN-based embeddings\nunderfit the training data and cover only a small subset of the language\ndefined by the CFG.

While standard subword tokenizers compress text by\na small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of\ncompression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally\ncompressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving\nefficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to\nthis goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are\nnot well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively\ncompressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome\nthis, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text\nis segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this\nmethod, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that\nimproves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on\nperplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse\nperplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter\ncount, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths\nrequire fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we\nprovide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability,\nand offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of\nhigh-compression tokenizers.",

│      * **Analyze the prefix:** Carefully read the provided document prefix  │
│  to identify explicit mentions of future sections, figures, and key         │
│  concepts that are likely to be elaborated upon. The prefix explicitly      │
│  mentions "Section III-B3" and "Fig. 4", and has a subsection titled "A.    │

│      * **Identify the document:** Since the task is to retrieve             │
│  information *from the same document*, the first step is to identify and    │
│  locate the full document. I will use keywords from the prefix to search    │
│  for the paper.                                                             │
│      * **Access relevant sections:** Once the document is identified, I     │
│  will use tools to access the content of "Section III-B3" and any further   │
│  details related to "Entropy bounds" and "Fig. 4".                          │
│      * **Extract and synthesize information:** From the accessed sections,  │
│  I will extract key facts, equations, definitions, and any other relevant   │
│  information.                                                               │
│      * **Formulate the synopsis:** Combine the extracted information into   │
│  a concise textual synopsis, ensuring it directly addresses the likely      │
│  future content and adheres to the non-hallucination constraint.            │
│                                                                             │

│      * **Identifying the specific paper:** The prefix does not provide a    │
│  title or authors. I will use highly specific phrases from the text, such   │
│  as "COMPRESSION USING LLMS", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and    │
│  "entropy bounds" to search for the paper. If a direct match isn't found,   │
│  I will broaden the search slightly while maintaining relevance.            │
│      * **Ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucination:** I will only        │
│  include information that is explicitly retrieved from the tools. If a      │
│  tool cannot provide specific details for a mentioned section or concept,   │
│  I will not invent it.                                                      │
│      * **Conciseness:** I will focus on extracting the most salient points  │
│  and summarizing them efficiently, avoiding verbose descriptions.           │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic use of available tools:**                                   │
│      * **`search_papers(query: str)`:** I will start by using this tool     │
│  with a query like "compression using LLMs encoding ranks arithmetic        │
│  coding entropy bounds" or similar combinations derived from the prefix to  │
│  find the specific research paper.                                          │
│      * **`download_paper(paper_id: str)` or `read_paper(paper_id: str)`:**  │
│  Once the paper is identified (via `paper_id` from `search_papers`), I      │
│  will use one of these to get access to the full content. `read_paper`      │
│  might be more suitable if I need to read specific sections.                │
│      * **`get_sections(paper_id: str)`:** This tool will be crucial to      │
│  directly navigate to "Section III-B3" and any subsequent sections related  │

[95m## Task:[00m [92mYou act as a deterministic research agent. Given the observed prefix of a document, use available MCP tools to retrieve information that is likely to appear later in the same document. Prefer authoritative sources. Produce a concise textual synopsis of the likely future content (facts, equations, definitions, datasets, references), suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. Maximize relevance to the document. Do not hallucinate; only include content supported by the tools.

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

−1/n log2 pSn(S1, . . . , Sn) = −1/n log2 pSn(Sn) → H(S) almost surely. (2)

Let ΩS be the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem implies

−1/i log2 pXi(X1, . . . , Xi) = −1/i log2 pXi(Xi) → H(X) almost surely. (3)

Define ΩX as the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have

lim i→∞ mi(S)/i = E [B] almost surely. (4)

Set ΩB to be the set of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. For any ω ∈ΩS ∩ ΩX ∩ ΩB, we deduce that

H(S) = lim k→∞ −1/k log2 pSk(Sk(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 pSli(Sli(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 Pr (Xi = T (Sli(ω)))

= −1/E[B] lim i→∞ 1/i log2 Pr (Xi = xi) = H(X)/E[B] .

The first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {li = mi(S(ω))|i ∈N} is an infinite subset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately gather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following two events, {ω ∈Ω|Xi(ω) = xi} = {ω ∈Ω|T (Smi(S(ω))) = xi}. This is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step holds because we are considering an ω ∈ΩB. The sets ΩS, ΩX, and ΩB each have probability one; this implies that their intersection also has

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the task:** The task requires me to act as a deterministic research agent. Given a document prefix, I need to predict and summarize the likely future content of the same document. This synopsis should be concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. I must strictly use the provided tools to retrieve information and avoid any hallucination. The document appears to be a research paper on compression techniques using language models, with a focus on rank-based and probability-based encoding, and an upcoming discussion on entropy bounds.

2. **Key steps to complete the task:**
    * **Analyze the prefix:** Carefully read the provided document prefix to identify explicit mentions of future sections, figures, and key concepts that are likely to be elaborated upon. The prefix explicitly mentions "Section III-B3" and "Fig. 4", and has a subsection titled "A. Entropy bounds".
    * **Identify the document:** Since the task is to retrieve information *from the same document*, the first step is to identify and locate the full document. I will use keywords from the prefix to search for the paper.
    * **Access relevant sections:** Once the document is identified, I will use tools to access the content of "Section III-B3" and any further details related to "Entropy bounds" and "Fig. 4".
    * **Extract and synthesize information:** From the accessed sections, I will extract key facts, equations, definitions, and any other relevant information.
    * **Formulate the synopsis:** Combine the extracted information into a concise textual synopsis, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future content and adheres to the non-hallucination constraint.

3. **Approach to challenges:**
    * **Identifying the specific paper:** The prefix does not provide a title or authors. I will use highly specific phrases from the text, such as "COMPRESSION USING LLMS", "encoding ranks", "arithmetic coding", and "entropy bounds" to search for the paper. If a direct match isn't found, I will broaden the search slightly while maintaining relevance.
    * **Ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucination:** I will only include information that is explicitly retrieved from the tools. If a tool cannot provide specific details for a mentioned section or concept, I will not invent it.
    * **Conciseness:** I will focus on extracting the most salient points and summarizing them efficiently, avoiding verbose descriptions.

4. **Strategic use of available tools:**
    * **`search_papers(query: str)`:** I will start by using this tool with a query like "compression using LLMs encoding ranks arithmetic coding entropy bounds" or similar combinations derived from the prefix to find the specific research paper.
    * **`download_paper(paper_id: str)` or `read_paper(paper_id: str)`:** Once the paper is identified (via `paper_id` from `search_papers`), I will use one of these to get access to the full content. `read_paper` might be more suitable if I need to read specific sections.
    * **`get_sections(paper_id: str)`:** This tool will be crucial to directly navigate to "Section III-B3" and any subsequent sections related to "Entropy bounds" or "Fig. 4" once the paper is identified.
    * **`extract_key_facts(text: str)` or `summarize_article_section(text: str, query: str)`:** After retrieving the content of the relevant sections, I will use these tools to extract the core information needed for the synopsis. `extract_key_facts` seems more appropriate for pulling out specific details like equations, definitions, and facts.

5. **Expected outcome:** A concise textual synopsis detailing the likely future content of the document. This will include:
    * Further elaboration on "Section III-B3" regarding "better compression... by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding."
    * More in-depth discussion and mathematical formulations related to "Entropy bounds" (Section III-A).
    * Details and explanations pertaining to "Fig. 4", which is described as "Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i."
    * Any other definitions, equations, or factual information that logically follows from the provided prefix and can be retrieved using the tools.

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work
