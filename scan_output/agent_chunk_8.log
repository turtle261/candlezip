## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

−1/n log2 pSn(S1, . . . , Sn) = −1/n log2 pSn(Sn) → H(S) almost surely. (2)

Let ΩS be the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem implies

−1/i log2 pXi(X1, . . . , Xi) = −1/i log2 pXi(Xi) → H(X) almost surely. (3)

Define ΩX as the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have

lim i→∞ mi(S)/i = E [B] almost surely. (4)

Set ΩB to be the set of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. For any ω ∈ΩS ∩ ΩX ∩ ΩB, we deduce that

H(S) = lim k→∞ −1/k log2 pSk(Sk(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 pSli(Sli(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 Pr (Xi = T (Sli(ω)))

= −1/E[B] lim i→∞ 1/i log2 Pr (Xi = xi) = H(X)/E[B] .

The first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {li = mi(S(ω))|i ∈N} is an infinite subset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately gather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following two events, {ω ∈Ω|Xi(ω) = xi} = {ω ∈Ω|T (Smi(S(ω))) = xi}. This is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step holds because we are considering an ω ∈ΩB. The sets ΩS, ΩX, and ΩB each have probability one; this implies that their intersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that

H(S) = H(X)/E[B] almost surely.

As a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to exploit.

Then, from the results of [1], we can see that

Pr ( H(X) ≤ lim NT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) ) = 1, (5)

where qi(·) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is given by

H(S) ≤ limNT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) / E[B] . (6)

We refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by Hub. The numerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens XNT and the denominator in (6) is the average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3 bits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and discussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance of several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc is the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.

### B. Encoding schemes

We consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.

1) **Compressing the ranks using zlib:** The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks. We refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by ρLLaMA+zlib.

2) **Token-by-Token Compression:** The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a time-varying codebook to encode

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. **Analyze the document prefix:** Identify key concepts, section headings, and explicit references to future content such as "Section III-B3", "Fig. 3", "In [1]", and "In [2, Table 4]". Also note the start of "### B. Encoding schemes" and its subsections.
2. **Identify explicit future references and infer content:**
    *   **Section III-B3:** The prefix explicitly states "arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3". The synopsis will include details on arithmetic coding.
    *   **Fig. 3:** The prefix mentions "lossless compression block in Fig. 3" in the context of encoding schemes. The synopsis will describe Fig. 3 as a schematic illustrating the lossless compression block.
    *   **In [1]:** The prefix refers to "Cover and King" and their estimate of "1.3 bits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S)", along with an "extensive list of references and discussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976".
    *   **In [2, Table 4]:** The prefix refers to "performance of several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc)". The synopsis will include details from this table.
    *   **Encoding schemes (Section III-B):**
        *   **1) Compressing the ranks using zlib:** This scheme is named "LLaMA+zlib" with compression ratio "ρLLaMA+zlib".
        *   **2) Token-by-Token Compression:** This scheme "uses a time-varying codebook to encode". Further details are expected.
3. **Formulate search queries and use tools to retrieve external information:**
    *   **For [1] (Cover and King):** Use `search_papers` with the query "Cover and King entropy of English 1.3 bits/character". Once the paper is identified, use `get_summary` or `extract_key_facts` to confirm and retrieve the specific details mentioned in the prefix.
    *   **For [2] (text8 dataset, bpc metric):** Use `search_papers` with the query "language models performance text8 dataset bits per character". Once the paper is identified, use `get_summary` or `extract_key_facts` to find information about Table 4 and the bpc metric.
4. **Synthesize synopsis:** Combine all the gathered information (inferred and retrieved) into a concise textual synopsis, ensuring maximum relevance to the document and avoiding hallucination. The synopsis will cover the likely future content, including facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references.

**Strategic use of tools:**
*   `search_papers`: To locate the external papers referenced by [1] and [2].
*   `get_summary` or `extract_key_facts`: To efficiently extract the specific information from the identified papers [1] and [2] as mentioned in the document prefix. I will prioritize `extract_key_facts` if the information is very specific, otherwise `get_summary` for a broader overview. If neither provides sufficient detail, `read_paper` would be a fallback, but given the specific mentions, `extract_key_facts` or `get_summary` should suffice.
*   Inference: For internal document references (Section III-B3, Fig. 3, and further details on encoding schemes), I will rely on the explicit mentions and context provided in the document prefix, as there are no tools to directly access future sections of the current document.

**Expected outcome:** A concise textual synopsis detailing:
*   The mechanism of arithmetic coding (Section III-B3).
*   The schematic of the lossless compression block (Fig. 3).
*   Further details on the "Token-by-Token Compression" scheme, including the use of a time-varying codebook.
*   Information from [1] by Cover and King, specifically their 1.3 bits/character estimate for H(S) and their review of literature on English entropy.

      "abstract": "A simple method for finding the entropy and redundancy of a reasonable long\nsample of English text by direct computer processing and from first principles\naccording to Shannon theory is presented. As an example, results on the entropy\nof the English language have been obtained based on a total of 20.3 million\ncharacters of written English, considering symbols from one to five hundred\ncharacters in length. Besides a more realistic value of the entropy of English,\na new perspective on some classic entropy-related concepts is presented. This\nmethod can also be extended to other Latin languages. Some implications for\npractical applications such as plagiarism-detection software, and the minimum\nnumber of words that should be used in social Internet network messaging, are\ndiscussed.",

      "abstract": "Calculating the Shannon entropy for symbolic sequences has been widely\nconsidered in many fields. For descriptive statistical problems such as\nestimating the N-gram entropy of English language text, a common approach is to\nuse as much data as possible to obtain progressively more accurate estimates.\nHowever in some instances, only short sequences may be available. This gives\nrise to the question of how many samples are needed to compute entropy. In this\npaper, we examine this problem and propose a method for estimating the number\nof samples required to compute Shannon entropy for a set of ranked symbolic\nnatural events. The result is developed using a modified Zipf-Mandelbrot law\nand the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality, and we propose an algorithm\nwhich yields an estimate for the minimum number of samples required to obtain\nan estimate of entropy with a given confidence level and degree of accuracy.",

We also find differences in word entropy between\nmedia categories, with short-form media such as news and magazines having\nhigher entropy than long-form media, and social media feeds having higher\nentropy still. To explain these results we develop an ecological model of the\nattention economy that combines ideas from Zipf's law and information foraging.\nIn this model, media consumers maximize information utility rate taking into\naccount the costs of information search, while media producers adapt to\ntechnologies that reduce search costs, driving them to generate higher entropy\ncontent in increasingly shorter formats.",

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The search results did not directly return the "Cover and King" paper with the exact title or a clear abstract mentioning "1.3 bits/character" as a direct estimate from their work. However, the last paper, "LLMZip: Lossless Text Compression using Large Language Models" (2306.04050v2), explicitly references `\cite{cover1978convergent}` and states that its estimate is "significantly smaller than currently available estimates in \cite{cover1978convergent}". This strongly suggests that `cover1978convergent` is the paper [1] being referred to. I will try to find the full reference for `cover1978convergent` and then search for that specific paper.
Let's try a more general search for "Cover King entropy English" to see if I can find the exact paper.[00m

Thought: The search results confirm that the paper [1] is likely "A Convergent Gambling Estimate of the Entropy of English" by T. Cover and R. King, published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 1978. The document prefix mentions "1.3 bits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S)" and "an extensive list of references and discussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976." I will try to get a summary of this paper to confirm these details.[00m

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

−1/n log2 pSn(S1, . . . , Sn) = −1/n log2 pSn(Sn) → H(S) almost surely. (2)

Let ΩS be the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem implies

−1/i log2 pXi(X1, . . . , Xi) = −1/i log2 pXi(Xi) → H(X) almost surely. (3)

Define ΩX as the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have

lim i→∞ mi(S)/i = E [B] almost surely. (4)

Set ΩB to be the set of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. For any ω ∈ΩS ∩ ΩX ∩ ΩB, we deduce that

H(S) = lim k→∞ −1/k log2 pSk(Sk(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 pSli(Sli(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 Pr (Xi = T (Sli(ω)))

= −1/E[B] lim i→∞ 1/i log2 Pr (Xi = xi) = H(X)/E[B] .

The first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {li = mi(S(ω))|i ∈N} is an infinite subset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately gather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following two events, {ω ∈Ω|Xi(ω) = xi} = {ω ∈Ω|T (Smi(S(ω))) = xi}. This is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step holds because we are considering an ω ∈ΩB. The sets ΩS, ΩX, and ΩB each have probability one; this implies that their intersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that

H(S) = H(X)/E[B] almost surely.

As a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to exploit.

Then, from the results of [1], we can see that

Pr ( H(X) ≤ lim NT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) ) = 1, (5)

where qi(·) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is given by

H(S) ≤ limNT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) / E[B] . (6)

We refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by Hub. The numerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens XNT and the denominator in (6) is the average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3 bits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and discussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance of several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc is the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.

### B. Encoding schemes

We consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.

1) **Compressing the ranks using zlib:** The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks. We refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by ρLLaMA+zlib.

2) **Token-by-Token Compression:** The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a time-varying codebook to encode

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. **Analyze the document prefix:** Identify key concepts, section headings, and explicit references to future content such as "Section III-B3", "Fig. 3", "In [1]", and "In [2, Table 4]". Also note the start of "### B. Encoding schemes" and its subsections.
2. **Identify explicit future references and infer content:**
    *   **Section III-B3:** The prefix explicitly states "arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3". The synopsis will include details on arithmetic coding.
    *   **Fig. 3:** The prefix mentions "lossless compression block in Fig. 3" in the context of encoding schemes. The synopsis will describe Fig. 3 as a schematic illustrating the lossless compression block.
    *   **In [1]:** The prefix refers to "Cover and King" and their estimate of "1.3 bits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S)", along with an "extensive list of references and discussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976".
    *   **In [2, Table 4]:** The prefix refers to "performance of several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc)". The synopsis will include details from this table.
    *   **Encoding schemes (Section III-B):**
        *   **1) Compressing the ranks using zlib:** This scheme is named "LLaMA+zlib" with compression ratio "ρLLaMA+zlib".
        *   **2) Token-by-Token Compression:** This scheme "uses a time-varying codebook to encode". Further details are expected.
3. **Formulate search queries and use tools to retrieve external information:**
    *   **For [1] (Cover and King):** Use `search_papers` with the query "Cover and King entropy of English 1.3 bits/character". Once the paper is identified, use `get_summary` or `extract_key_facts` to confirm and retrieve the specific details mentioned in the prefix.
    *   **For [2] (text8 dataset, bpc metric):** Use `search_papers` with the query "language models performance text8 dataset bits per character". Once the paper is identified, use `get_summary` or `extract_key_facts` to find information about Table 4 and the bpc metric.
4. **Synthesize synopsis:** Combine all the gathered information (inferred and retrieved) into a concise textual synopsis, ensuring maximum relevance to the document and avoiding hallucination. The synopsis will cover the likely future content, including facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references.

**Strategic use of tools:**
*   `search_papers`: To locate the external papers referenced by [1] and [2].
*   `get_summary` or `extract_key_facts`: To efficiently extract the specific information from the identified papers [1] and [2] as mentioned in the document prefix. I will prioritize `extract_key_facts` if the information is very specific, otherwise `get_summary` for a broader overview. If neither provides sufficient detail, `read_paper` would be a fallback, but given the specific mentions, `extract_key_facts` or `get_summary` should suffice.
*   Inference: For internal document references (Section III-B3, Fig. 3, and further details on encoding schemes), I will rely on the explicit mentions and context provided in the document prefix, as there are no tools to directly access future sections of the current document.

**Expected outcome:** A concise textual synopsis detailing:
*   The mechanism of arithmetic coding (Section III-B3).
*   The schematic of the lossless compression block (Fig. 3).
*   Further details on the "Token-by-Token Compression" scheme, including the use of a time-varying codebook.
*   Information from [1] by Cover and King, specifically their 1.3 bits/character estimate for H(S) and their review of literature on English entropy.

As an example, results on the entropy\nof the English language have been obtained based on a total of 20.3 million\ncharacters of written English, considering symbols from one to five hundred\ncharacters in length. Besides a more realistic value of the entropy of English,\na new perspective on some classic entropy-related concepts is presented. This\nmethod can also be extended to other Latin languages. Some implications for\npractical applications such as plagiarism-detection software, and the minimum\nnumber of words that should be used in social Internet network messaging, are\ndiscussed.",

      "abstract": "Calculating the Shannon entropy for symbolic sequences has been widely\nconsidered in many fields. For descriptive statistical problems such as\nestimating the N-gram entropy of English language text, a common approach is to\nuse as much data as possible to obtain progressively more accurate estimates.\nHowever in some instances, only short sequences may be available. This gives\nrise to the question of how many samples are needed to compute entropy. In this\npaper, we examine this problem and propose a method for estimating the number\nof samples required to compute Shannon entropy for a set of ranked symbolic\nnatural events. The result is developed using a modified Zipf-Mandelbrot law\nand the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality, and we propose an algorithm\nwhich yields an estimate for the minimum number of samples required to obtain\nan estimate of entropy with a given confidence level and degree of accuracy.",

We also find differences in word entropy between\nmedia categories, with short-form media such as news and magazines having\nhigher entropy than long-form media, and social media feeds having higher\nentropy still. To explain these results we develop an ecological model of the\nattention economy that combines ideas from Zipf's law and information foraging.\nIn this model, media consumers maximize information utility rate taking into\naccount the costs of information search, while media producers adapt to\ntechnologies that reduce search costs, driving them to generate higher entropy\ncontent in increasingly shorter formats.",

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The search results did not directly return the "Cover and King" paper with the exact title or a clear abstract mentioning "1.3 bits/character" as a direct estimate from their work. However, the last paper, "LLMZip: Lossless Text Compression using Large Language Models" (2306.04050v2), explicitly references `\cite{cover1978convergent}` and states that its estimate is "significantly smaller than currently available estimates in \cite{cover1978convergent}". This strongly suggests that `cover1978convergent` is the paper [1] being referred to. I will try to find the full reference for `cover1978convergent` and then search for that specific paper.
Let's try a more general search for "Cover King entropy English" to see if I can find the exact paper.[00m

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The direct search for "Cover King entropy English" did not yield results. Given that the document prefix mentions "Cover and King provide 1.3 bits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and discussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976," and the `LLMZip` paper (2306.04050v2) references `cover1978convergent`, it's highly likely that the paper is "Cover, T. M., & King, R. C. (1978). A convergent gambling estimate of the entropy of English. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 24(4), 413-421."
I will now search for this specific paper on arXiv using its title and authors to confirm and get its abstract if available, or use `search_papers` with a more precise query.[00m

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work

│  **1. Understanding the Task:**                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  As an AI Assistant, my role is to act as a deterministic research agent.   │
│  Given a document prefix, I need to predict and retrieve information        │
│  likely to appear later in the same document. This information should be    │
│  concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a language model           │
│  compressor. I must prioritize authoritative sources, avoid hallucination,  │
│  and only include content directly supported by the available MCP tools.    │
│  The core focus is on identifying and summarizing the content of upcoming   │
│  sections, particularly specific encoding schemes and referenced            │
│  literature.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Analyze the Document Prefix:** Thoroughly read the provided text to  │
│  identify the current topic, structure, explicit mentions of future         │
│  sections (e.g., "Section III-B3"), and specific references (e.g., [1],     │
│  [2], [8]).                                                                 │
│  2.  **Identify the Source Document (Primary Goal):** Attempt to locate     │
│  the full research paper from which the prefix was extracted. This is the   │
│  most direct and authoritative way to retrieve the exact future content.    │
│  3.  **Extract Specific Section Content:** If the paper is found, navigate  │
│  to and extract the content of the explicitly mentioned upcoming sections   │
│  (e.g., III-B2, III-B3).                                                    │
│  4.  **Retrieve Full Reference Details:** Obtain the complete               │
│  bibliographic information for all cited references ([1], [2], [8]).        │
│  5.  **Synthesize Synopsis:** Compile all retrieved information into a      │
│  concise textual synopsis, focusing on facts, equations, definitions,       │
│  datasets, and references, ensuring it directly addresses the likely        │
│  future content of the document.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Difficulty in Identifying the Paper:** If a direct search for the    │
│  paper using specific phrases from the prefix fails, I will broaden my      │
│  search queries, focusing on unique combinations of concepts (e.g., "LLM    │
│  compression arithmetic coding," "H(S) = H(X)/E[B]"), authors (Cover and    │
│  King), and datasets (text8).                                               │
│  *   **Incomplete Paper Access:** If I can find the paper but cannot fully  │
│  read its content through the tools (e.g., only abstract or specific        │
│  sections are accessible), I will resort to targeted searches for the       │
│  specific concepts mentioned (e.g., "token-by-token compression             │
│  time-varying codebook," "arithmetic coding with LLM probabilities") and    │
│  for the full reference details.                                            │
│  *   **Ensuring Relevance and Conciseness:** I will filter retrieved        │
│  information strictly to what is directly implied by the prefix as "likely  │
│  to appear later in the same document." I will avoid general background     │
│  information unless it's explicitly part of an upcoming definition or       │
│  explanation within the document's scope.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. Strategic Use of Available Tools:**                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **`search_papers(query=...)`**: This will be my primary tool for Step  │
│  2 (identifying the source document) and Step 3 (if the paper isn't fully   │
│  accessible, then searching for specific concepts or references). I will    │
│  craft highly specific queries using unique phrases and references from     │
│  the prefix.                                                                │
│      *   *Initial Query:* `search_papers(query="compression using LLMs      │
│  arithmetic coding entropy bounds H(S) = H(X)/E[B] Cover King 1.3           │
│  bits/character text8 bpc")`                                                │
│      *   *Fallback Queries (if needed):*                                    │
│  `search_papers(query="token-by-token compression time-varying codebook     │
│  language model")`, `search_papers(query="arithmetic coding language model  │
│  compression probabilities")`, `search_papers(query="Cover and King         │
│  entropy estimate English 1976")`, `search_papers(query="language model     │
│  performance text8 bpc")`.                                                  │
│  *   **`download_paper(paper_id=...)`**: If `search_papers` successfully    │
│  identifies a specific paper, I will use this to attempt to download it.    │
│  *   **`read_paper(paper_id=...)`**: After downloading, this tool will be   │
│  crucial for directly extracting the content of sections III-B2, III-B3,    │
│  and the full "References" section.                                         │
│  *   **`get_sections(paper_id=...)`**: If `read_paper` provides structured  │
│  access, this will help me quickly locate the relevant sections.            │
│  *   **`summarize_article_section(paper_id=..., section_title=...)`**: If   │
│  direct extraction is too verbose, this could help distill the content of   │
│  specific sections, though I will prioritize direct quotes or factual       │
│  summaries to avoid interpretation.                                         │
│  *   **`search_wikipedia(query=...)`**: This will be a fallback for         │
│  general definitions (e.g., "Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem") if the      │
│  paper's own explanation isn't found or is insufficient, or to quickly      │
│  verify basic concepts.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│                                                                             │

│  *   A detailed description of the "Token-by-Token Compression" scheme      │
│  (III-B2), elaborating on its use of a time-varying codebook.               │
│  *   A detailed explanation of "Arithmetic Coding" (III-B3), specifically   │
│  how it is applied in conjunction with LLM-produced probabilities for       │
│  compression.                                                               │
│  *   The full bibliographic citations for references [1] (Cover and King),  │
│  [2] (the paper evaluating LLMs on text8 with bpc), and [8] (the source     │
│  for the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem).                                 │
│  *   Any other directly implied future content, such as further             │
│  experimental details or comparisons, if revealed by the full paper         │
│  structure.                                                                 │

intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

−1/n log2 pSn(S1, . . . , Sn) = −1/n log2 pSn(Sn) → H(S) almost surely. (2)

Let ΩS be the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem implies

−1/i log2 pXi(X1, . . . , Xi) = −1/i log2 pXi(Xi) → H(X) almost surely. (3)

Define ΩX as the collection of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have

lim i→∞ mi(S)/i = E [B] almost surely. (4)

Set ΩB to be the set of ω ∈Ω for which this limit holds. For any ω ∈ΩS ∩ ΩX ∩ ΩB, we deduce that

H(S) = lim k→∞ −1/k log2 pSk(Sk(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 pSli(Sli(ω))

= lim i→∞ −1/li log2 Pr (Xi = T (Sli(ω)))

= −1/E[B] lim i→∞ 1/i log2 Pr (Xi = xi) = H(X)/E[B] .

The first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {li = mi(S(ω))|i ∈N} is an infinite subset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately gather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following two events, {ω ∈Ω|Xi(ω) = xi} = {ω ∈Ω|T (Smi(S(ω))) = xi}. This is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step holds because we are considering an ω ∈ΩB. The sets ΩS, ΩX, and ΩB each have probability one; this implies that their intersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that

H(S) = H(X)/E[B] almost surely.

As a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to exploit.

Then, from the results of [1], we can see that

Pr ( H(X) ≤ lim NT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) ) = 1, (5)

where qi(·) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is given by

H(S) ≤ limNT →∞ −1/NT �NT i=1 log2 qi(Xi) / E[B] . (6)

We refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by Hub. The numerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens XNT and the denominator in (6) is the average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3 bits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and discussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance of several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc is the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.

### B. Encoding schemes

We consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.

1) **Compressing the ranks using zlib:** The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks. We refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by ρLLaMA+zlib.

2) **Token-by-Token Compression:** The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a time-varying codebook to encode

Reasoning Plan:
## Strategic Plan for Document Content Retrieval

**1. Understanding the Task:**

As an AI Assistant, my role is to act as a deterministic research agent. Given a document prefix, I need to predict and retrieve information likely to appear later in the same document. This information should be concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. I must prioritize authoritative sources, avoid hallucination, and only include content directly supported by the available MCP tools. The core focus is on identifying and summarizing the content of upcoming sections, particularly specific encoding schemes and referenced literature.

**2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:**

1.  **Analyze the Document Prefix:** Thoroughly read the provided text to identify the current topic, structure, explicit mentions of future sections (e.g., "Section III-B3"), and specific references (e.g., [1], [2], [8]).
2.  **Identify the Source Document (Primary Goal):** Attempt to locate the full research paper from which the prefix was extracted. This is the most direct and authoritative way to retrieve the exact future content.
3.  **Extract Specific Section Content:** If the paper is found, navigate to and extract the content of the explicitly mentioned upcoming sections (e.g., III-B2, III-B3).
4.  **Retrieve Full Reference Details:** Obtain the complete bibliographic information for all cited references ([1], [2], [8]).
5.  **Synthesize Synopsis:** Compile all retrieved information into a concise textual synopsis, focusing on facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future content of the document.

**3. Approach to Challenges:**

*   **Difficulty in Identifying the Paper:** If a direct search for the paper using specific phrases from the prefix fails, I will broaden my search queries, focusing on unique combinations of concepts (e.g., "LLM compression arithmetic coding," "H(S) = H(X)/E[B]"), authors (Cover and King), and datasets (text8).
*   **Incomplete Paper Access:** If I can find the paper but cannot fully read its content through the tools (e.g., only abstract or specific sections are accessible), I will resort to targeted searches for the specific concepts mentioned (e.g., "token-by-token compression time-varying codebook," "arithmetic coding with LLM probabilities") and for the full reference details.
*   **Ensuring Relevance and Conciseness:** I will filter retrieved information strictly to what is directly implied by the prefix as "likely to appear later in the same document." I will avoid general background information unless it's explicitly part of an upcoming definition or explanation within the document's scope.

**4. Strategic Use of Available Tools:**

*   **`search_papers(query=...)`**: This will be my primary tool for Step 2 (identifying the source document) and Step 3 (if the paper isn't fully accessible, then searching for specific concepts or references). I will craft highly specific queries using unique phrases and references from the prefix.
    *   *Initial Query:* `search_papers(query="compression using LLMs arithmetic coding entropy bounds H(S) = H(X)/E[B] Cover King 1.3 bits/character text8 bpc")`
    *   *Fallback Queries (if needed):* `search_papers(query="token-by-token compression time-varying codebook language model")`, `search_papers(query="arithmetic coding language model compression probabilities")`, `search_papers(query="Cover and King entropy estimate English 1976")`, `search_papers(query="language model performance text8 bpc")`.
*   **`download_paper(paper_id=...)`**: If `search_papers` successfully identifies a specific paper, I will use this to attempt to download it.
*   **`read_paper(paper_id=...)`**: After downloading, this tool will be crucial for directly extracting the content of sections III-B2, III-B3, and the full "References" section.
*   **`get_sections(paper_id=...)`**: If `read_paper` provides structured access, this will help me quickly locate the relevant sections.
*   **`summarize_article_section(paper_id=..., section_title=...)`**: If direct extraction is too verbose, this could help distill the content of specific sections, though I will prioritize direct quotes or factual summaries to avoid interpretation.
*   **`search_wikipedia(query=...)`**: This will be a fallback for general definitions (e.g., "Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem") if the paper's own explanation isn't found or is insufficient, or to quickly verify basic concepts.

**5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**

The expected outcome is a concise, factual textual synopsis. It will include:
*   A detailed description of the "Token-by-Token Compression" scheme (III-B2), elaborating on its use of a time-varying codebook.
*   A detailed explanation of "Arithmetic Coding" (III-B3), specifically how it is applied in conjunction with LLM-produced probabilities for compression.
*   The full bibliographic citations for references [1] (Cover and King), [2] (the paper evaluating LLMs on text8 with bpc), and [8] (the source for the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem).
*   Any other directly implied future content, such as further experimental details or comparisons, if revealed by the full paper structure.

This outcome directly aligns with the primary goal of completing the task accurately and efficiently by leveraging available tools to retrieve information likely to appear later in the document, presented in a format suitable for conditioning a language model compressor.

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: My previous attempts to find the paper directly or by searching for reference [1] (Cover and King) have not been successful. The `search` tool (DuckDuckGo) also failed to find "Cover and King entropy estimate English 1.3 bits/character". This suggests that the exact phrasing might be too specific or the paper is not easily discoverable through these general search methods.
However, the document prefix is very detailed about the structure and content. It explicitly mentions:
*   "Section III-B3" for arithmetic coding.
*   "Section III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS" as the main section.
*   "Fig. 4. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i."
*   "III-B. Encoding schemes"
*   "III-B1) Compressing the ranks using zlib: LLaMA+zlib"
*   "III-B2) Token-by-Token Compression: uses a time-varying codebook"
*   "Reference [1]: Cover and King, 1.3 bits/character estimate"
*   "Reference [2]: performance of several language models... on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc)"
*   "Reference [8]: Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem"
Given that I cannot find the paper directly, I will try to find the *content* of the missing sections by searching for the specific phrases and concepts mentioned. I will focus on:
1.  "Token-by-Token Compression" and "time-varying codebook" (for III-B2).
2.  "Arithmetic coding" and "probabilities produced by the LLM" (for III-B3).
3.  The full details of references [1], [2], and [8].
Let's start by searching for the specific compression schemes. I will use `search_papers` first, as it's more likely to yield academic papers. If that fails, I'll use `search` (DuckDuckGo).
First, for "Token-by-Token Compression" with "time-varying codebook".Action: search_papers[00m

The\nGoldfish reach lower FLORES perplexities than BLOOM, XGLM, and MaLA-500 on 98\nof 204 FLORES languages, despite each Goldfish model being over 10x smaller.\nHowever, the Goldfish significantly underperform larger multilingual models on\nreasoning benchmarks, suggesting that for low-resource languages,\nmultilinguality primarily improves general reasoning abilities rather than\nbasic text generation. We release models trained on 5MB (350 languages), 10MB\n(288 languages), 100MB (166 languages), and 1GB (83 languages) of text data\nwhere available. The Goldfish models are available as baselines, fine-tuning\nsources, or augmentations to existing models in low-resource NLP research, and\nthey are further useful for crosslinguistic studies requiring maximally\ncomparable models across languages.",

We train a linear classifier on a binary language\nidentity task, to classify tokens between Language X and Language Y. Applying a\ncounterfactual probing procedure, we use the classifier weights to project the\nembeddings into the null space and push the resulting embeddings either in the\ndirection of Language X or Language Y. Then we evaluate on a masked language\nmodeling task. We find that, given a template in Language X, pushing towards\nLanguage Y systematically increases the probability of Language Y words, above\nand beyond a third-party control language. But it does not specifically push\nthe model towards translation-equivalent words in Language Y. Pushing towards\nLanguage X (the same direction as the template) has a minimal effect, but\nsomewhat degrades these models. Overall, we take these results as further\nevidence of the rich structure of massive multilingual language models, which\ninclude both a language-specific and language-general component. And we show\nthat counterfactual probing can be fruitfully applied to multilingual models.",

In this\ncontext, lossless data compression techniques, like Arithmetic Coding, offer an\neffective solution owing to their high compression ratio. However, the standard\nArithmetic Coding technique is computationally intensive, leading to high\nmemory and processing overhead. This paper proposes an optimized version of\nArithmetic coding for the IoT environment that incorporates three improvements\nusing Iterative and Iteration Optimizations for minimizing redundant\ncomputations and achieving faster convergence; Principal Component\nAnalysis(PCA) for dimensionality reduction and identifying key features; and\nlastly, Cardinality reduction for grouping similar probabilities to improve the\ncompression efficiency. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of\nimages and demonstrated significant reductions in the time to compress, CPU\nutilization, and memory consumption, and preserves data integrity as seen\nthrough the low RMSE values. The optimized version of the Arithmetic Coding\nalgorithm achieves an impressive compression ratio of 814:1 and 101 ms to\ncompress a single image. This makes the optimized algorithm suitable for\nreal-time applications and resource-constrained environments for efficient data\ntransmission and storage.",

Next, we show some of its basic properties, which are\nlater used in the computational techniques required for a practical\nimplementation. In the second part, we cover the practical implementation\naspects, including arithmetic operations with low precision, the subdivision of\ncoding and modeling, and the realization of adaptive encoders. We also analyze\nthe arithmetic coding computational complexity, and techniques to reduce it.",

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work
