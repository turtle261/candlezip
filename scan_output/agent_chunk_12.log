│  2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                     │
│      *   **Thorough Prefix Analysis:** I will meticulously read and         │
│  analyze the provided document prefix to identify all explicit and          │
│  implicit mentions of future content. This includes references to upcoming  │
│  sections, tables, figures, and discussions.                                │
│      *   **Extraction of Specific Details:** For each identified piece of   │
│  future content (e.g., Table I, Table II, etc.), I will extract all         │
│  descriptive details provided in the prefix regarding its content,          │
│  purpose, and key findings.                                                 │
│      *   **Identification of Standard Research Paper Structure:** Based on  │
│  the current section (IV. RESULTS), I will anticipate standard subsequent   │
│  sections in a research paper, such as "Discussion," "Conclusion," and      │
│  "References."                                                              │
│      *   **Synthesis of Synopsis:** I will compile the extracted details    │
│  and anticipated structural elements into a concise textual synopsis,       │
│  ensuring it directly reflects the information presented in the prefix.     │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│      *   **Avoiding Hallucination:** This is a primary constraint. I will   │
│  strictly adhere to information explicitly stated or strongly implied       │
│  within the document prefix. I will not introduce any external information  │
│  or make assumptions beyond what the text provides.                         │
│      *   **Maximizing Relevance:** I will prioritize information that       │
│  directly extends or elaborates on the topics already introduced in the     │
│  prefix, such as the detailed results of the compression schemes, the       │
│  performance on different datasets, and the analysis of those results.      │
│      *   **Conciseness:** I will extract only the most salient points and   │
│  present them in a brief, summary-like format, focusing on the core facts   │
│  and findings.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Use of Available Tools:**                                   │
│      Given that the document prefix itself explicitly describes the         │
│  content of upcoming sections and tables, the most direct and               │
│  authoritative "tool" for this task is the careful reading and synthesis    │
│  of the provided text. The prompt asks to "retrieve information that is     │
│  likely to appear later in the same document." The document prefix is the   │
│  most reliable source for this. Therefore, I will not be using `search`,    │
│  `search_papers`, or other external information retrieval tools, as the     │
│  task is to infer content *within the same document*, not to find related   │
│  external information. My internal processing and understanding of the      │
│  provided text will serve as the mechanism for "retrieving" this            │
│  information. The `create_reasoning_plan` tool is for planning, which I am  │
│  currently using.                                                           │

│  5. **Expected Outcome:**                                                   │
│  The expected outcome is a concise textual synopsis that accurately         │
│  describes the likely future content of the document. This will include:    │
│      *   The complete data for Table I, detailing compression results for   │
│  1MB of text from the text8 dataset across 10 batches and an average,       │
│  including metrics like `Hub (bpc)`, `ρLLaMA+zlib (bpc)`, `ρLLaMA+TbyT      │

│      *   The full content of Table II, illustrating the dependence of       │
│  compression performance on the LLM's memory (M), and a discussion of the   │

│  of the LLM on the Project Gutenberg book, including specific compression   │
│  ratios (e.g., 0.8426 bpc for LLaMA with arithmetic coding).                │
│      *   Further detailed discussion and interpretation of the results      │
│  presented in these tables, including comparisons with baselines and        │
│  existing literature.                                                       │
│      *   A "Discussion" or "Conclusion" section that will likely address    │
│  the implications of the findings, limitations of the study (e.g., text8    │
│  dataset bias, different input sizes for comparisons), and potential        │
│  avenues for future research.                                               │
│      *   A "References" section listing all cited works.                    │

### B. Encoding schemes

We consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.

1) **Compressing the ranks using zlib:** The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks. We refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by ρLLaMA+zlib.

2) **Token-by-Token Compression:** The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a time-varying codebook to encode the token xi at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming qi to be the true distribution of the tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where the codeword for the token xi is of length li = ⌈log2 1/qi(xi)⌉. A prefix-free code with this length for xi is guaranteed to exist since this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by ρLLaMA+TbyT, is given by

ρLLaMA+TbyT = �NT i=1 ⌈log2 1/qi(xi)⌉ / �NT i=1 bi .

3) **Arithmetic Coding:** The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to combine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding is well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use qi(xi) as the probability of token xi at time in the arithmetic coding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as ρLLM+AC. It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly optimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be

ρLLM+AC ≈ �NT i=1 log2 1/qi(xi) / �NT i=1 bi . (7)

Clearly, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). Hub, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind when interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.

## IV. RESULTS

We used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary of size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction with the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase letters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet is restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between these models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM. Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of LLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ algorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the paq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ or paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.

The performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average performance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the state-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the LLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I also shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by Shannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].

The dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) is shown in Table II. As expected, the compression performance improves with increasing M. We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly with the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a memory of 31 tokens.

It is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA-7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds to estimates obtained from different input sizes.

It appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset is derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.

Therefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project Gutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8 dataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset. Table IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the entropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of LLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression ratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).

To provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors, we also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the last column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm may not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the LLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.

Reasoning Plan:
1. **Understanding of the Task:**
As an AI Assistant, I understand the task is to act as a deterministic research agent. Given a document prefix, I need to identify and synthesize information that is highly likely to appear later in the same document. This synopsis should be concise, factual, and suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. Crucially, I must only include content explicitly supported by the provided text or by the use of available tools, avoiding any form of hallucination. The focus is on facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references.

2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**
    *   **Thorough Prefix Analysis:** I will meticulously read and analyze the provided document prefix to identify all explicit and implicit mentions of future content. This includes references to upcoming sections, tables, figures, and discussions.
    *   **Extraction of Specific Details:** For each identified piece of future content (e.g., Table I, Table II, etc.), I will extract all descriptive details provided in the prefix regarding its content, purpose, and key findings.
    *   **Identification of Standard Research Paper Structure:** Based on the current section (IV. RESULTS), I will anticipate standard subsequent sections in a research paper, such as "Discussion," "Conclusion," and "References."
    *   **Synthesis of Synopsis:** I will compile the extracted details and anticipated structural elements into a concise textual synopsis, ensuring it directly reflects the information presented in the prefix.

3. **Approach to Challenges:**

    *   **Maximizing Relevance:** I will prioritize information that directly extends or elaborates on the topics already introduced in the prefix, such as the detailed results of the compression schemes, the performance on different datasets, and the analysis of those results.
    *   **Conciseness:** I will extract only the most salient points and present them in a brief, summary-like format, focusing on the core facts and findings.

4. **Strategic Use of Available Tools:**
    Given that the document prefix itself explicitly describes the content of upcoming sections and tables, the most direct and authoritative "tool" for this task is the careful reading and synthesis of the provided text. The prompt asks to "retrieve information that is likely to appear later in the same document." The document prefix is the most reliable source for this. Therefore, I will not be using `search`, `search_papers`, or other external information retrieval tools, as the task is to infer content *within the same document*, not to find related external information. My internal processing and understanding of the provided text will serve as the mechanism for "retrieving" this information. The `create_reasoning_plan` tool is for planning, which I am currently using.

5. **Expected Outcome:**
The expected outcome is a concise textual synopsis that accurately describes the likely future content of the document. This will include:
    *   The complete data for Table I, detailing compression results for 1MB of text from the text8 dataset across 10 batches and an average, including metrics like `Hub (bpc)`, `ρLLaMA+zlib (bpc)`, `ρLLaMA+TbyT (bpc)`, `ρLLaMA+AC (bpc)`, `ZPAQ (bpc)`, and `pq8h (bpc)`.
    *   The full content of Table II, illustrating the dependence of compression performance on the LLM's memory (M), and a discussion of the observed linear scaling of inference time.
    *   The full content of Table III, presenting the empirical mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios.
    *   The full content of Table IV, showing the compression performance of the LLM on the Project Gutenberg book, including specific compression ratios (e.g., 0.8426 bpc for LLaMA with arithmetic coding).
    *   Further detailed discussion and interpretation of the results presented in these tables, including comparisons with baselines and existing literature.
    *   A "Discussion" or "Conclusion" section that will likely address the implications of the findings, limitations of the study (e.g., text8 dataset bias, different input sizes for comparisons), and potential avenues for future research.
    *   A "References" section listing all cited works.

This outcome directly aligns with my primary goal of completing the task accurately and efficiently by providing a clear, accurate response based on the available information.

The document will continue with the full data for **Table I: RESULTS FOR 1MB OF TEXT FROM TEXT8 DATASET**, which details the compression performance of LLaMA+zlib, LLaMA+TbyT, and LLaMA+AC schemes, along with Hub (bpc), ZPAQ (bpc), and pq8h (bpc) for 10 batches of 100,000 tokens and their average. It will show that LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding achieves 0.7101 bits/character, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines like ZPAQ (1.4 bpc) and paq8h (1.2 bpc), and is close to the computed upper bound.

Following this, **Table II** will be presented, illustrating the dependence of compression performance on the memory (M) of the LLM, showing that performance improves with increasing M and that inference time scales approximately linearly with input memory length.

**Table III** will then provide the empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios, calculated from the 10 batches of 100,000 tokens.

The document will discuss limitations, noting that the comparison with state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset (derived from Wikipedia) might be optimistic due to LLaMA-7B likely being trained on Wikipedia articles and not being run on the entire 100MB text8 dataset.

To address this, the document will introduce results from a recently released (May 25, 2023) book from Project Gutenberg [7]. **Table IV** will show the compression performance of the LLM on this new dataset, indicating slightly higher compression ratios and entropy upper bounds compared to text8, but still outperforming known models [2, Table 4]. Specifically, LLaMA with arithmetic coding will achieve 0.8426 bits/character on this dataset.

Finally, a comparison with the direct zlib algorithm (2.8 bits/character) will be provided, highlighting the substantial improvement offered by LLaMA-based compressors, while acknowledging that zlib's performance might improve on longer texts. The document will conclude with a **References** section, listing cited works such as [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].[00m

│  1. Understanding of the task: The task requires me to act as a             │
│  deterministic research agent and, given a document prefix, identify and    │
│  synthesize information that is explicitly stated within the prefix as      │
│  likely to appear later in the same document. This includes facts,          │
│  equations, definitions, datasets, references. The output should be a       │
│  concise textual synopsis, maximizing relevance and avoiding                │
│  hallucination. A critical constraint is that the content must be           │
│  "supported by the tools."                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key steps:                                                              │
│      *   Analyze the document prefix: Carefully read the provided text to   │
│  identify all explicit mentions of future content, such as upcoming         │
│  sections, tables, figures, discussions, and references.                    │
│      *   Extract specific details: For each identified piece of future      │
│  content, extract the key facts, descriptions, and any associated details   │
│  (e.g., table names, what they show, datasets used, specific references).   │
│      *   Synthesize the synopsis: Combine the extracted details into a      │
│  concise textual synopsis, organized logically to reflect the likely flow   │
│  of the document.                                                           │
│      *   Address tool constraint: The information for the synopsis is       │
│  directly present in the provided document prefix, which explicitly         │
│  describes future content. While no specific MCP tool is available to       │
│  *extract* these descriptions from an arbitrary text prefix, the            │
│  information is inherently "supported" by its direct presence in the input  │
│  document. If a tool were available to parse the prefix for such explicit   │
│  mentions of future content, it would be utilized.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach to challenges: The primary challenge is the "only include      │
│  content supported by the tools" constraint, as no tool is available to     │
│  directly process the given text prefix to extract descriptions of future   │
│  content. My approach is to interpret the direct presence of the            │
│  information within the input prefix as fulfilling the "supported"          │
│  requirement, as the document itself is the source. I will explicitly       │
│  state this interpretation in my plan.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic use of available tools:                                       │
│      *   `create_reasoning_plan`: This tool will be used to submit this     │
│  detailed plan.                                                             │
│      *   Other tools: No other MCP tools are directly applicable to         │
│  *extracting* information from the *given prefix* in this specific          │
│  scenario. The information is already "retrieved" by being present in the   │
│  input.                                                                     │

### B. Encoding schemes

We consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.

1) **Compressing the ranks using zlib:** The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks. We refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by ρLLaMA+zlib.

2) **Token-by-Token Compression:** The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a time-varying codebook to encode the token xi at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming qi to be the true distribution of the tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where the codeword for the token xi is of length li = ⌈log2 1/qi(xi)⌉. A prefix-free code with this length for xi is guaranteed to exist since this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by ρLLaMA+TbyT, is given by

ρLLaMA+TbyT = �NT i=1 ⌈log2 1/qi(xi)⌉ / �NT i=1 bi .

3) **Arithmetic Coding:** The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to combine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding is well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use qi(xi) as the probability of token xi at time in the arithmetic coding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as ρLLM+AC. It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly optimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be

ρLLM+AC ≈ �NT i=1 log2 1/qi(xi) / �NT i=1 bi . (7)

Clearly, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). Hub, ρLLaMA+zlib, ρLLaMA+TbyT, and ρLLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind when interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.

## IV. RESULTS

We used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary of size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction with the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase letters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet is restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between these models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM. Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of LLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ algorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the paq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ or paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.

The performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average performance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the state-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the LLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I also shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by Shannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].

The dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) is shown in Table II. As expected, the compression performance improves with increasing M. We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly with the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a memory of 31 tokens.

It is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA-7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds to estimates obtained from different input sizes.

It appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset is derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.

Therefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project Gutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8 dataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset. Table IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the entropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of LLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression ratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).

To provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors, we also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the last column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm may not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the LLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. Understanding of the task: The task requires me to act as a deterministic research agent and, given a document prefix, identify and synthesize information that is explicitly stated within the prefix as likely to appear later in the same document. This includes facts, equations, definitions, datasets, references. The output should be a concise textual synopsis, maximizing relevance and avoiding hallucination. A critical constraint is that the content must be "supported by the tools."

2. Key steps:
    *   Analyze the document prefix: Carefully read the provided text to identify all explicit mentions of future content, such as upcoming sections, tables, figures, discussions, and references.
    *   Extract specific details: For each identified piece of future content, extract the key facts, descriptions, and any associated details (e.g., table names, what they show, datasets used, specific references).
    *   Synthesize the synopsis: Combine the extracted details into a concise textual synopsis, organized logically to reflect the likely flow of the document.
    *   Address tool constraint: The information for the synopsis is directly present in the provided document prefix, which explicitly describes future content. While no specific MCP tool is available to *extract* these descriptions from an arbitrary text prefix, the information is inherently "supported" by its direct presence in the input document. If a tool were available to parse the prefix for such explicit mentions of future content, it would be utilized.

3. Approach to challenges: The primary challenge is the "only include content supported by the tools" constraint, as no tool is available to directly process the given text prefix to extract descriptions of future content. My approach is to interpret the direct presence of the information within the input prefix as fulfilling the "supported" requirement, as the document itself is the source. I will explicitly state this interpretation in my plan.

4. Strategic use of available tools:
    *   `create_reasoning_plan`: This tool will be used to submit this detailed plan.
    *   Other tools: No other MCP tools are directly applicable to *extracting* information from the *given prefix* in this specific scenario. The information is already "retrieved" by being present in the input.

5. Expected outcome: A concise textual synopsis of the likely future content of the document, including details about:
    *   The continuation and completion of Table I, detailing results for 1MB of text from the text8 dataset, including various compression ratios and baselines.
    *   Table II, illustrating the dependence of compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) and its impact on inference time.
    *   Table III, presenting the empirical mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios from multiple batches.
    *   Further discussion on the comparison of LLaMA-7B with state-of-the-art results (ZPAQ, paq8h) and other entropy estimates from references [1], [2], [3], [5], [12].
    *   Details regarding the text8 dataset and the Project Gutenberg book dataset [7] used for evaluation.
    *   Table IV, showcasing the compression performance of the LLM on the Project Gutenberg book, including comparisons with text8 results and direct zlib application.
    *   The full list of references [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] will be present in the complete document.[00m
