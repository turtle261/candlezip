Document prefix (UTF-8 text):
 human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence that reads as

My first attempt at writing a book

Our goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can be reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)

′My′, ′first′, ′attempt′, ′at′, ′writing′, ′a′, ′book′

A language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the past M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in Figure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be words such as ′reading′,′ writing′,′ driving′,′ cooking′ etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in our sentence (′writing′) in this list and call it R5. We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank 0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for ′writing′ is R5 = 1.

**Fig. 1.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| reading  | 0.3        |
| writing  | 0.2        |
| cycling  | 0.1        |
| driving  | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R5 = 1

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

**Fig. 4.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

    - Use `search_wikipedia` for definitions and foundational understanding of concepts like arithmetic coding, entropy, and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem.

5. Filter and synthesize information:
    - Extract facts, equations, definitions, and references directly relevant to the identified future topics.
    - Prioritize information that directly extends or elaborates on the concepts introduced in the prefix.
    - Ensure all extracted information is supported by search results to avoid hallucination.

6. Construct the synopsis:
    - Compile the filtered information into a concise textual synopsis.
    - Focus on the likely content of Section III-B3, the continuation of the "Entropy bounds" section, and further details on tokenizers.

Strategic use of tools:
- `search_papers(query='arithmetic coding language model probabilities')`: To find details on how arithmetic coding is applied with LLM probabilities for compression, likely content for Section III-B3.
- `search_papers(query='entropy bounds language model compression')`: To find mathematical derivations and discussions related to H(S) and H(X) and the role of tokenizers, continuing the "Entropy bounds" section.
- `search_wikipedia(query='Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem')`: To get a concise definition and context for the theorem mentioned.
- `search_papers(query='tokenizer properties language model compression')`: To elaborate on the characteristics of tokenizers and their implications for compression.
- `search_wikipedia(query='arithmetic coding')`: To understand the general principles of arithmetic coding if needed for context.

Expected outcome:
A concise textual synopsis detailing:
- The mechanism of arithmetic coding when applied to the probabilities generated by a language model, as an improvement over rank encoding.
- Further mathematical development of entropy bounds, including the full statement or implications of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem in the context of language and token sequences.

Language model systems often enable LLMs to generate\ncode for arithmetic operations to achieve accurate calculations. However, this\napproach compromises speed and security, and fine-tuning risks the language\nmodel losing prior capabilities. We propose a framework that enables exact\narithmetic in a single autoregressive step, providing faster, more secure, and\nmore interpretable LLM systems with arithmetic capabilities. We use the hidden\nstates of a LLM to control a symbolic architecture that performs arithmetic.\nOur implementation using Llama 3 with OccamNet as a symbolic model (OccamLlama)\nachieves 100\\% accuracy on single arithmetic operations\n($+,-,\\times,\\div,\\sin{},\\cos{},\\log{},\\exp{},\\sqrt{}$), outperforming GPT 4o\nwith and without a code interpreter. Furthermore, OccamLlama outperforms GPT 4o\nwith and without a code interpreter on average across a range of mathematical\nproblem solving benchmarks, demonstrating that OccamLLMs can excel in\narithmetic tasks, even surpassing much larger models. We will make our code\npublic shortly.",

PRISM learns continuous\nrelative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving\nposition uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional\ndeterministic embeddings.

Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's\nstochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal\nstates, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization.

In this work, we investigate if the surface form of a number has any\ninfluence on how sequence-to-sequence language models learn simple arithmetic\ntasks such as addition and subtraction across a wide range of values. We find\nthat how a number is represented in its surface form has a strong influence on\nthe model's accuracy. In particular, the model fails to learn addition of\nfive-digit numbers when using subwords (e.g., \"32\"), and it struggles to learn\nwith character-level representations (e.g., \"3 2\"). By introducing position\ntokens (e.g., \"3 10e1 2\"), the model learns to accurately add and subtract\nnumbers up to 60 digits. We conclude that modern pretrained language models can\neasily learn arithmetic from very few examples, as long as we use the proper\nsurface representation. This result bolsters evidence that subword tokenizers\nand positional encodings are components in current transformer designs that\nmight need improvement. Moreover, we show that regardless of the number of\nparameters and training examples, models cannot learn addition rules that are\nindependent of the length of the numbers seen during training.

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The search results for "arithmetic coding language model probabilities compression" primarily focus on LLMs performing arithmetic tasks, rather than using arithmetic coding for compressing LLM outputs. This is a common ambiguity with the term "arithmetic" in the context of LLMs. The document prefix explicitly states "arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3" in the context of compressing the sequence of ranks or probabilities.
Therefore, I need to refine my search to focus on *arithmetic coding* as a compression technique, specifically in the context of language models and their output probabilities. I will also search for the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem and its relation to language models and entropy.

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The Wikipedia search for "arithmetic coding compression language model" provided some relevant snippets. It confirms that arithmetic coding is a compression technique that can be coupled with probabilistic modeling. The "Data compression" snippet mentions "statistical estimates can be coupled to an algorithm called arithmetic coding." This aligns with the document's statement about using probabilities from the LLM. The "Huffman coding" snippet also mentions arithmetic coding as a more optimal replacement.
This confirms that Section III-B3 will likely detail how arithmetic coding uses the probability mass function (PMF) `qi(xi)` produced by the LLM to achieve better compression than simply encoding ranks. Arithmetic coding works by representing the entire message as a single fractional number, where the length of the fraction is proportional to the negative logarithm of the product of the probabilities of the symbols in the message. A good language model provides accurate probabilities, leading to a smaller fractional range and thus better compression.
Now, let's gather information on the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem and its relation to language models and entropy, which is explicitly mentioned in Section III-A.Action: search_wikipedia[00m

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work

This suggests the query might be too specific for Wikipedia's search function.

The document will likely elaborate on two main areas:

**Section III-B3: Compression using LLM Probabilities and Arithmetic Coding**
This section will detail how arithmetic coding achieves better compression by directly utilizing the probability mass function (PMF) `qi(xi)` produced by the LLM for each token `xi`. Unlike rank encoding, which only uses the rank `ri`, arithmetic coding leverages the precise probabilities `qi(j)` for all possible tokens `j` at each epoch `i`. The core idea is that arithmetic coding represents the entire sequence of tokens as a single fractional number within the unit interval [0, 1). The range of this interval is successively narrowed based on the cumulative probabilities of the observed tokens. A more accurate language model, providing sharper probability distributions (i.e., higher probabilities for the actual next token), will result in a smaller final interval, requiring fewer bits to uniquely identify the encoded message. This method is generally more efficient than Huffman coding or simple rank compression because it can encode symbols with fractional bit lengths, approaching the theoretical entropy limit.

**Section III-A: Entropy Bounds (Continuation)**
This section will complete the mathematical formulation of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem (also known as the Asymptotic Equipartition Property, AEP). For a stationary and ergodic random process representing language input `S`, the theorem states that for sufficiently long sequences `Sn`, the probability `pSn(S1, ..., Sn)` will be approximately `2^(-n * H(S))`, where `H(S)` is the entropy rate of the character sequence. The document will extend this concept to the token sequence `X = X1, X2, ...` and establish a formal relationship between the entropy rate of the character sequence `H(S)` and the entropy rate of the token sequence `H(X)`. This relationship will likely involve the average number of characters per token, `E[Bi]`, where `Bi` is the random variable representing the number of characters in the `i`-th token. The discussion will highlight how the properties of the tokenizer (e.g., `Bi >= 1` and `Bi < B < infinity`) influence this relationship and, consequently, the theoretical limits of compression. The theorem provides a foundational link between the statistical properties of the language source and the minimum achievable compression rate. The reference [8] will likely be to a seminal work on information theory, such as "Elements of Information Theory" by Cover and Thomas.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mYou act as a deterministic research agent. Given the observed prefix of a document, use available MCP tools to retrieve information that is likely to appear later in the same document. Prefer authoritative sources. Produce a concise textual synopsis of the likely future content (facts, equations, definitions, datasets, references), suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. Maximize relevance to the document. Do not hallucinate; only include content supported by the tools.

Document prefix (UTF-8 text):
 human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence that reads as

My first attempt at writing a book

Our goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can be reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)

′My′, ′first′, ′attempt′, ′at′, ′writing′, ′a′, ′book′

A language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the past M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in Figure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be words such as ′reading′,′ writing′,′ driving′,′ cooking′ etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in our sentence (′writing′) in this list and call it R5. We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank 0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for ′writing′ is R5 = 1.

**Fig. 1.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| reading  | 0.3        |
| writing  | 0.2        |
| cycling  | 0.1        |
| driving  | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R5 = 1

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

**Fig. 4.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought:The document prefix details a method for text compression using language models, focusing on encoding ranks or probabilities of predicted tokens. It introduces concepts like compression ratio, entropy bounds, and mentions the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem. Section III-B3 is explicitly mentioned as discussing "better compression... by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding." Section III-A, "Entropy bounds," has just begun and references the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8]. The document also starts defining tokenizer functions (T, mi(s), bi).
My goal is to predict likely future content. Based on the prefix, I expect:
1.  A detailed explanation of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem and its implications for language entropy.
2.  A detailed explanation of arithmetic coding in the context of language model probabilities, as promised by the mention of Section III-B3.
3.  Further mathematical development of the tokenizer properties and their role in the compression framework.
4.  Potentially, discussions on practical aspects, datasets, or experimental results, though the prefix is currently very theoretical.
I will start by searching for information on the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem and its relevance to language models and compression, as it's directly referenced. Then I will look into arithmetic coding with language model probabilities.
First, let's search for the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem. I'll use `search_wikipedia` for a general understanding and then `search_papers` to see its application in language models/compression.Action:search_wikipedia[00m

It is fundamental to the concept of typical set used in theories of data compression.\nRoughly speaking, the theorem states that although there are many series of results that may be produced by a random process, the one actually produced is most probably from a loosely defined set of outcomes that all have approximately the same chance of being the one actually realized. (This is a consequence of the law of large numbers and ergodic theory.) Although there are individual outcomes which have a higher probability than any outcome in this set, the vast number of outcomes in the set almost guarantees that the outcome will come from the set. One way of intuitively understanding the property is through Cramér's large deviation theorem, which states that the probability of a large deviation from mean decays exponentially with the number of samples. Such results are studied in large deviations theory; intuitively, it is the large deviations that would violate equipartition, but these are unlikely.\nIn the field of pseudorandom number generation, a candidate generator of undetermined quality whose output sequence lies too far outside the typical set by some statistical criteria is rejected as insufficiently random. Thus, although the typical set is loosely defined, practical notions arise concerning sufficient typicality."}[00m

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought:The summary of the Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) confirms its relevance to data compression and the concept of a "typical set," where sequences produced by a stochastic source (like language) tend to have approximately the same probability. This directly relates to the "Entropy bounds" section in the document, which discusses H(S) and H(X) and references the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem. The document will likely elaborate on how this theorem establishes the fundamental limits of compression for a given language model, linking the entropy of the source to the achievable compression ratio.
Next, I need to gather information about arithmetic coding in the context of language models, as Section III-B3 promises a discussion on "better compression... by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding."Action:search[00m

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought:The Wikipedia search for "Arithmetic coding" provides a good overview. It states that arithmetic coding "differs from other forms of entropy encoding, such as Huffman coding, in that rather than separating the input into component symbols and replacing each with a code word, it encodes the entire message into a single number, a fraction in [0,1)." It also mentions that it can achieve compression ratios close to the theoretical entropy limit. This is highly relevant to the document's goal of achieving "least possible length" and using "probabilities produced by the LLM."
The document explicitly mentions "Section III-B3" will discuss arithmetic coding with probabilities. This suggests a detailed explanation of how the language model's predicted probabilities `qi(xi)` are used by an arithmetic coder to achieve better compression than rank-based encoding.
I have information on the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem (AEP) and a general understanding of arithmetic coding. The document also introduces tokenizer functions `T`, `mi(s)`, and `bi`. I should try to find more specific information on how these tokenizer properties relate to language model compression, or if there are standard definitions/properties that the document will likely elaborate on.
Given the technical nature of the document, searching for academic papers on "tokenizer properties language model compression" might be beneficial. However, the document itself is defining these terms, so a general search might be more appropriate to understand the context. I will try `search_papers` first, as it's an authoritative source for this kind of technical detail.Action:search_papers[00m

These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies\noften fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer\ntoken sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a\nframework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference\ntime, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip\nconsists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch\n(LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable\n\"hypertokens\" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for\nnewly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant\nthat trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We\nshow that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via\nparameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to\nuse hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by\n20-60\\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.",

While standard subword tokenizers compress text by\na small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of\ncompression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally\ncompressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving\nefficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to\nthis goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are\nnot well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively\ncompressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome\nthis, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text\nis segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this\nmethod, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that\nimproves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on\nperplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse\nperplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter\ncount, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths\nrequire fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we\nprovide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability,\nand offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of\nhigh-compression tokenizers.",

      "abstract": "Causal decoder-only transformer models used for generative language\nmodelling, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), are trained to\npredict the next token in a sequence based only on its previous tokens. Despite\nthis simple training objective, they have proved to be powerful AI tools.\nHowever, only predicting the next token results in top layer embedding vectors\nthat are highly token-focused. There may be benefits in generating embedding\nvectors at each token position that better capture the overall meaning of\nlonger sequences of future text. Recent studies matching brain scans with deep\nlanguage models suggest that humans also predict upcoming words when listening\nor reading but consider multiple future tokens rather than just one.\n  This research investigates a new pretraining method called Future Token\nPrediction (FTP). In FTP, a large transformer encoder generates top layer\nembedding vectors for each token position, which, instead of being passed to a\nlanguage head, are linearly and expansively projected to a pseudo-sequence,\nwhich is cross attended to by a small transformer decoder to predict the next N\ntokens forward from that position in the sequence.\n  The top layer embedding vectors from FTP models exhibit distinct properties\ncompared to those from standard GPT models, varying smoothly along a text\nsequence as measured by cosine similarity between adjacent tokens. Text\ngenerated by FTP models show improved topic coherence compared to standard\nGPT-like models trained with the same prediction perplexity for the next single\ntoken. The vectors are shown to better represent the topic of text based on the\nresults of text classification examples. On a toy, but complex, coding problem,\nFTP networks produce significantly better results than GPT networks.",

Prior works compress prompts\ninto smaller sequences of learned tokens using an encoder that is trained as a\nLowRank Adaptation (LoRA) of the inference language model. However, we show\nthat the encoder does not need to keep the original language model's\narchitecture to achieve useful compression. We introduce the Attention-Only\nCompressor (AOC), which learns a prompt compression encoder after removing the\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP) layers in the Transformer blocks of a language\nmodel, resulting in an encoder with roughly 67% less parameters compared to the\noriginal model. Intriguingly we find that, across a range of compression ratios\nup to 480x, AOC can better regenerate prompts and outperform a baseline\ncompression encoder that is a LoRA of the inference language model without\nremoving MLP layers. These results demonstrate that the architecture of prompt\ncompression encoders does not need to be identical to that of the original\ndecoder language model, paving the way for further research into architectures\nand approaches for prompt compression.",

An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is\nthat it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible\nmemory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework\nthat hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage.\nBy retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves\n16$\\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly\noutperforming the state-of-the-art.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mYou act as a deterministic research agent. Given the observed prefix of a document, use available MCP tools to retrieve information that is likely to appear later in the same document. Prefer authoritative sources. Produce a concise textual synopsis of the likely future content (facts, equations, definitions, datasets, references), suitable for conditioning a language model compressor. Maximize relevance to the document. Do not hallucinate; only include content supported by the tools.

Document prefix (UTF-8 text):
 human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence that reads as

My first attempt at writing a book

Our goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can be reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)

′My′, ′first′, ′attempt′, ′at′, ′writing′, ′a′, ′book′

A language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the past M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in Figure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be words such as ′reading′,′ writing′,′ driving′,′ cooking′ etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in our sentence (′writing′) in this list and call it R5. We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank 0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for ′writing′ is R5 = 1.

**Fig. 1.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| reading  | 0.3        |
| writing  | 0.2        |
| cycling  | 0.1        |
| driving  | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R5 = 1

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M, xi−M+1, . . . , xi−1 and produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by qi(xi) := Pr(Xi = xi|xi−1, xi−2, . . . , xi−M), ∀xi ∈X. The PMF vector qi := [qi(1), qi(2), . . . , qi(D)]T is sorted in descending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by ˜qi. Let γi : X →X be a permutation on the integers from 1 to D such that ˜qi(γi(j)) = qi(j), ∀j ∈X.

That is, γi(j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the token xi at epoch i, ri := γi(xi). The sequence {ri}NT i=1 is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to produce Nb bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors qi’s in addition to the sequence of ranks.

The main metric of interest is the compression ratio ρ defined as

ρ := Nb / Nc bits/character.

**Fig. 4.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.

### A. Entropy bounds

Let S ∈S∞ be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by Sn, whereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as Sn. The tokenizer parses the input string and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X1, X2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, Xi is the ith token. The number of characters employed to generate Xi depends on the realization of the random process and, as such, we introduce random variable Bi to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical considerations, we only admit tokenizers for which Bi ≥1 and Bi is uniformly bounded, with Bi < B < ∞; these are characteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens grows unbounded NT →∞, the number of characters must also approach infinity Nc →∞. Formally, consider the tokenizer function T : SN →X N operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S∞. For natural number, i ∈N, define mi : SN →N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an input sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then

mi(s) = min n {length (T (sn)) ≥i} . (1)

We note that, by construction, limn→∞ length (T (sn)) = ∞ and, as such, mi(·) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress that the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map to the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially may be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances where T (sn) = T (sn+1). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the restricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted set for which T (yn) = xi is smi(s). Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token as

bi = mi(s) − mi−1(s)

with initial condition m−1 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first NT tokens for a random input becomes Nc = �NT i=1 Bi.

Having established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {Sk}∞ k=1, {Bi}∞ i=1, and {Xi}∞ i=1 are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. Analyze the document prefix to identify key concepts, terms, and the overall direction of the document.
    - Key concepts identified: Language model compression, rank-based encoding, probability-based encoding, lossless compression (zip, arithmetic coding, Huffman coding), compression ratio, entropy bounds, Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem, tokenizer functions.
    - Overall direction: The document explains a method for compressing text using language models by encoding the ranks or probabilities of predicted tokens, and then delves into the theoretical underpinnings, specifically entropy bounds.

2. Formulate targeted search queries based on the identified concepts that are likely to be expanded upon later in the document.
    - Query 1: "Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem language model compression" to understand its application in the context of the document's "Entropy bounds" section.
    - Query 2: "arithmetic coding language model probabilities" to get details on the "better compression" method mentioned in Section III-B3.
    - Query 3: "language model compression techniques overview" to find general information that might fill in gaps or provide context for the methods discussed.
    - Query 4: "tokenizer function properties in language models" to elaborate on the `T`, `mi(s)`, and `bi` concepts introduced.

3. Execute searches using `search_papers` for authoritative sources, as the document is highly technical and references a theorem. If `search_papers` is insufficient for general definitions, `search` will be used.

4. Filter and synthesize information from the search results, focusing on facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references that directly relate to the likely future content of the document. Prioritize information that logically extends the concepts introduced in the prefix.

5. Construct a concise textual synopsis of the likely future content, ensuring all information is supported by the tools and maximizes relevance to the document. Avoid any hallucination.

Expected Outcome: A concise textual synopsis detailing:
- The full statement or implications of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem in the context of language compression and entropy bounds.
- Detailed explanation of arithmetic coding when applied to language model probabilities, including its advantages over rank-based encoding.
- Further mathematical formulations or algorithms related to language model compression.
- Elaboration on the properties and functions of tokenizers (`T`, `mi(s)`, `bi`).

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The document prefix details a method for text compression using language models, focusing on encoding ranks or probabilities of predicted tokens. It introduces concepts like lossless compression (zip, arithmetic coding, Huffman coding), compression ratio, and entropy bounds. Specifically, it mentions that "better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3." It also introduces the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] in the context of entropy bounds and the relationship between character and token entropy.
Based on this, the likely future content will include:
1.  A detailed explanation of arithmetic coding when applied to language model probabilities (Section III-B3).
2.  Further elaboration on entropy bounds, including the full statement and implications of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem, and its application to the relationship between character entropy H(S) and token entropy H(X).
3.  More mathematical formulations related to these compression schemes.
4.  Potentially, the specific reference [8] for the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem.
I will use `search_papers` to find information on these topics, prioritizing authoritative sources.
First, I'll search for "Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem language model entropy" to understand its application in this context.
Second, I'll search for "arithmetic coding language model probability compression" to get details on the method mentioned for Section III-B3.

It can compress task-irrelevant redundant\ninformation and preserve necessary information relevant to the target for\nmulti-task prediction.

This estimate is significantly smaller than currently available\nestimates in [1], [2]. A natural byproduct is an algorithm for lossless compression of English text which combines the prediction\nfrom the large language model with a lossless compression scheme. Preliminary results from limited experiments suggest that our\nscheme outperforms state-of-the-art text compression schemes such as BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.\n\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\n\n\nThere are close connections between learning, prediction, and compression. The success of ChatGPT has captured the\nfascination of general public and brought the connection between learning and prediction to the fore. The main advance\nbrought about by large language models such as LLaMA and GPT-4 is that they excel at predicting the next word (token) in\na paragraph based on knowing the past several words (tokens).\nThe connection between prediction and compression was explored as early as 1951 by Shannon in order to estimate the\nentropy of the English language [3]. The idea that a good predictor for the ith value in a time series based on the past\nvalues can be effectively converted to a good compression algorithm has played a prominent role in information theory. Many\nalgorithms for speech, image, and video compression exploit this idea either explicitly or implicitly. Within the context of\nlossless compression of English text, the idea of combining a language model with arithmetic coding has emerged as a very\neffective paradigm [4]. The performance of such a compression scheme depends substantially on the efficacy of the predictor\nand every time there is a major advance in the prediction capability, it behooves us to study its effect on the compression\nperformance. Indeed, in 2018, the authors of [5] used recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the predictor and reported improved\nresults for certain kinds of sources. Their scheme still did not outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as BSC and ZPAQ\nfor text compression.\nIt is therefore natural at this time to study whether we can obtain better compression results and sharper estimates of the\nentropy of the English language using recent large language models such as LLaMA-7B [6]. This is the main goal of this\npaper. We show that when the LLaMA-7B large language model is used as the predictor, the asymptotic upper bound on the\nentropy is 0.709 bits/character when estimated using a 1MB section of the text8 dataset. This is smaller than earlier estimates\nprovided in [1] and [2, Table 4]. The estimate of the upper bound increases to 0.85 bits/character for a 100 KB section of\nthe text from [7], which is still lower than the estimates in [2]. When LLaMA-7B is combined with an Arithmetic coder for\ncompression, we obtain a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character on a 1MB section of the text8 dataset and a compression\nratio of 0.8426 bits/character on a 100KB section of a text from [7], which are significantly better than the compression ratio\nobtained using BSC, ZPAQ and pq8h on the full 100MB of the text8 dataset.\n\n\nII. I NTUITIVE EXPLANATION OF THE MAIN IDEA\n\n\nWe will use the following example to describe the main idea, which is nearly identical to that proposed by Shannon in [3]\nfor estimating the entropy of English. The main difference is in the use of tokens which represent groups of letters of variable\nlength and in the use of a large language model instead of a human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence\nthat reads as\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\nOur goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can\nbe reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)\n\n\n\u2032 My \u2032, \u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032, \u2032 writing \u2032, \u2032 a \u2032, \u2032 book \u2032\n\n\nA language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the\npast M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in\n\n\n2\n\n\nFigure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be\nwords such as [\u2032] reading [\u2032], [\u2032] writing [\u2032], [\u2032] driving [\u2032], [\u2032] cooking [\u2032] etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in\nour sentence ( [\u2032] writing [\u2032] ) in this list and call it R 5 . We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank\n0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for [\u2032] writing [\u2032] is R 5 = 1.\n\n\nTokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032 My \u2032, \u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n|Col1|LLM|q = Pr(x5|x4 1)<br>5|Rank<br>computation|R5 = 1|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||LLM|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>||\n\n\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreading 0.3\nwriting 0.2\ncycling 0.1\ndriving 0.05\n\n... ...\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nThen, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2\nthrough 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same\nword in the sentence that we wish to encode, [\u2032] a [\u2032], and hence, the rank R 6 would be 0.\n\n\nTokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032, \u2032 writing \u2032\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n|Col1|LLM|q = Pr(x6|x5 2)<br>6|Rank<br>computation|R6 = 0|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||LLM|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>||\n\n\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nan 0.2\n\nthe 0.05\n\n... ...\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nIf the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the\nrank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the\nrank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be\n\n\n1, 0, 0, . . .\n\n\nA sequence with many \u20180\u2019s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the\nranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the\nranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\nSequence of ranks\n\n|e of ranks|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|. ., rNT|Compression (zip)|Nb|\n||||\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.\n\n\nWhen we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language\nmodel one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at\nrank R i during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the\nsame LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.\n\nThe idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the\nprobabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.\n\n\n3\n\n\nIII. C OMPRESSION USING LLM S\n\n\nLet s denote a sentence from the English language composed of N c letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the\nalphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of N T tokens\ndenoted by x = x 1, x 2, . . ., x i\u22121, x i, x i+1, . . . x N T, where x i \u2208X . There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence,\ncompressing s is the same as compressing x. x i \u2019s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the\nupper case letter X i .\nA language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens x i\u2212M, x i\u2212M+1, . . ., x i\u22121\nand produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by\nq i (x i ) := Pr(X i = x i |x i\u22121, x i\u22122, . . ., x i\u2212M ), \u2200x i \u2208X . The PMF vector q i := [q i (1), q i (2), . . ., q i (D)] [T] is sorted in\ndescending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by \u02dcq i . Let \u03b3 i : X \u2192X be a permutation on the integers\nfrom 1 to D such that\n\n\u02dc\nq i (\u03b3 i (j)) = q i (j), \u2200j \u2208X .\n\n\nThat is, \u03b3 i (j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the\ntoken x i at epoch i, r i := \u03b3 i (x i ). The sequence {r i } [N] i=1 [T] [is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to]\nproduce N b bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general,\nthe lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors q i \u2019s in addition to the sequence of ranks.\nThe main metric of interest is the compression ratio \u03c1 defined as\n\n\u03c1 := [N] [b] bits/character.\n\nN c\n\n\n\nLosseless\n\nCompression\n\n\n\nTokens . . ., x i\u2212M, . . ., x i\u22121\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n\nInput sentence s with N c characters\n\n\n\ni i i\u22121 Rank\n\nLLM\ncomputation\n\n\n\nq i = Pr(X i = j|x [i] i [\u2212] \u2212 [M] 1 [)] Rank r i Losseless N b bits\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.\n\n\nA. Entropy bounds\n\n\nLet S \u2208S [\u221e] be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by S n,\nwhereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as S n . The tokenizer parses the input\nstring and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X 1, X 2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, X i is the ith\ntoken. The number of characters employed to generate X i depends on the realization of the random process and, as such,\nwe introduce random variable B i to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical\nconsiderations, we only admit tokenizers for which B i \u2265 1 and B i is uniformly bounded, with B i < B < \u221e; these are\ncharacteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens\ngrows unbounded N T \u2192\u221e, the number of characters must also approach infinity N c \u2192\u221e. Formally, consider the tokenizer\nfunction T : S [N] \u2192X [N] operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S [\u221e] . For\nnatural number, i \u2208 N, define m i : S [N] \u2192 N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an\ninput sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then\n\n\nm i (s) = min n [{][length (][T][ (][s] [n] [))][ \u2265] [i][}][ .] (1)\n\n\nWe note that, by construction, lim n\u2192\u221e length (T (s n )) = \u221e and, as such, m i (\u00b7) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress\nthat the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map\nto the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially\nmay be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances\nwhere T (s n ) = T (s n+1 ). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the\nrestricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted\nset for which T (y n ) = x i is s m i (s) . Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token\n\nas\nb i = m i (s) \u2212 m i\u22121 (s)\n\n\n4\n\n\nwith initial condition m \u22121 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first N T tokens for a random input\nbecomes N c = [\ufffd] i [N] =1 [T] [B] [i] [.]\nHaving established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {S k } [\u221e] k=1 [,]\n{B i } [\u221e] i=1 [, and][ {][X] [i] [}] [\u221e] i=1 [are stationary and ergodic processes.

For any \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 S \u2229 \u2126 X \u2229 \u2126 B, we deduce that\n\n\nH(S) = lim\nk\u2192\u221e [\u2212] k [1] [log] [2] [ p] [S] [k] [(][S] [k] [(][\u03c9][))]\n\n= lim i\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i log 2 p S li (S l i (\u03c9))\n\n\n= lim log 2 Pr (X i = T (S l i (\u03c9)))\ni\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i\n\n\n\n1\n\ni [log] [2] [ Pr (][X] [i] [ =][ x] [i] [) =][ H] E [(] B [X][)]\n\n\n\n1 1\n\n= \u2212\nE[B] i [lim] \u2192\u221e i\n\n\n\nE[B] [.]\n\n\n\nThe first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {l i = m i (S(\u03c9))|i \u2208 N} is an infinite\nsubset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately\ngather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following\n\ntwo events,\n{\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|X i (\u03c9) = x i } = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|T (S m i (S(\u03c9)) ) = x i }.\n\n\nThis is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step\nholds because we are considering an \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 B . The sets \u2126 S, \u2126 X, and \u2126 B each have probability one; this implies that their\nintersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that\n\nH(S) = [H][(][X][)] almost surely.\n\nE[B]\n\n\nAs a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to\nexploit.\nThen, from the results of [1], we can see that\n\n\n\nPr\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nH(X) \u2264 lim\nN T \u2192\u221e [\u2212] N [1] T\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd log 2 q i (X i )\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n= 1, (5)\n\n\n\nwhere q i (\u00b7) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is\ngiven by\n\n\n\n\n[1] N T\n\nN T \ufffd i=1 [log] 2 [q] [i] [(][X] [i] [)]\n\n\n\nH(S) \u2264 lim N T \u2192\u221e \u2212 N [1]\n\n\n\n. (6)\nE[B]\n\n\n\nWe refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by H ub . The\nnumerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens X N T and the denominator in (6) is\nthe average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3\nbits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and\ndiscussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance\nof several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc\nis the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.\n\n\nB. Encoding schemes\n\n\nWe consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.\n\n\n5\n\n\n1) Compressing the ranks using zlib: The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks.\nWe refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib .\n2) Token-by-Token Compression: The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a\ntime-varying codebook to encode the token x i at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming q i to be the true distribution of\nthe tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where\n1\nthe codeword for the token x i is of length l i = \u2308log 2 q i (x i ) [\u2309][. A prefix-free code with this length for][ x] [i] [ is guaranteed to exist]\nsince this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT,\nis given by\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n1\nlog 2\n\ufffd q i (x i )\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT =\n\n\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] .\n\n\n\n3) Arithmetic Coding: The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to\ncombine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding\nis well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use q i (x i ) as the probability of token x i at time in the arithmetic\ncoding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as \u03c1 LLM+AC . It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly\noptimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLM+AC \u2248\n\n\n\nN T 1\n\ufffd i=1 log 2 q i (x i )\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] . (7)\n\n\n\nClearly, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and \u03c1 LLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). H ub, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and\n\u03c1 LLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind\nwhen interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.\n\n\nIV. R ESULTS\n\n\nWe used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary\nof size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction\nwith the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase\nletters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet\nis restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between\nthese models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM.\n[Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip)\nLLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ\nalgorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the\npaq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to\nbe best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ\nor paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.\nThe performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average\nperformance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with\nArithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the\nstate-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the\nLLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I\nalso shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by\nShannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].\nThe dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M ) is shown in Table II. As expected, the\ncompression performance improves with increasing M . We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly\nwith the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a\nmemory of 31 tokens.\nIt is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and\nhence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and\ncompression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds\nto estimates obtained from different input sizes.\nIt appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset\nis derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.\n\n\n6\n\n\nTherefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project\nGutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8\ndataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset.\nTable IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the\nentropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper\nbound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of\nLLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression\nratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).\nTo provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors,\nwe also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the\nlast column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm\nmay not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the\nLLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.\n\n\nV. A CKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\n\nWe would like to thank Andreas Kirsch for an email discussion about arithmetic coding that motivated us to add our results\non arithmetic coding in a timely manner.\n\n\nTABLE I\n\nR ESULTS FOR 1MB OF TEXT FROM TEXT 8 DATASET\n\n\n\nBatch\nN c N T\n\n\n\nH ub \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT \u03c1 LLaMA+AC ZPAQ pq8h\n\n\n\nNo. (bpc) file size (bits) (bpc) (bpc) (bpc) (bpc)\n\n\n1 466, 650 100, 000 0.6882 1.0513 0.8215 0.689\n\n\n2 461, 477 100, 000 0.6893 1.0558 0.8242 0.6901\n\n\n3 454, 599 100, 000 0.699 1.0681 0.8357 0.6999\n\n\n4 462, 755 100, 000 0.6748 1.0346 0.8093 0.6757\n\n\n5 453, 847 100, 000 0.7481 1.1265 0.8831 0.749\n\n\n6 458, 252 100, 000 0.7218 1.0957 0.8567 0.7227\n\n\n7 451, 036 100, 000 0.6959 1.0729 0.8353 0.6968\n\n\n8 447, 953 100, 000 0.7092 1.0896 0.8489 0.7101\n\n\n9 462, 665 100, 000 0.7394 1.1126 0.8713 0.7402\n\n\n10 449, 621 100, 000 0.7269 1.1046 0.8643 0.7277\n\n\nTotal 9, 137, 710 2, 000, 000 0.7093 1.0812 0.845 0.7101 1.4 [1] 1.2 [2]\n\n\nTABLE II\n\nC OMPRESSION PERFORMANCE OF THE LLM ON THE TEXT 8 DATASET, AS A FUNCTION OF ITS MEMORY (M )\n\n\n\nM N c N t\n\n\n\nH ub \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT \u03c1 LLaMA+AC\n\n\n(bpc) file size (bits) (bpc) (bpc)\n\n\n\n31 4, 568, 855 1, 000, 000 0.9139 1.3159 1.0425 0.9145\n\n\n127 4, 568, 855 1, 000, 000 0.7511 1.1303 0.8847 0.752\n\n\n255 4, 568, 855 1, 000, 000 0.7242 1.0985 0.859 0.725\n\n\n511 4, 568, 855 1, 000, 000 0.7093 1.0812 0.845 0.7101\n\n\n1 This result is taken from [5] and it corresponds to the full 100MB dataset text8\n2 This result is taken from [12] and it corresponds to the full 100MB dataset text8\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nTABLE III\n\nM EAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE ENTROPY BOUNDS MEASURED OVER 10 BATCHES OF 100,000 TOKENS\n\n\nH ub \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT \u03c1 LLaMA+AC\nM\n\n(bpc) (bpc) (bpc) (bpc)\n\n\n31 0.9139 \u00b1 0.0263 1.3159 \u00b1 0.0329 1.0425 \u00b1 0.0262 0.9145 \u00b1 0.0263\n\n\n127 0.7511 \u00b1 0.0233 1.1303 \u00b1 0.0292 0.8847 \u00b1 0.0231 0.752 \u00b1 0.0233\n\n\n255 0.7242 \u00b1 0.0234 1.0985 \u00b1 0.0289 0.859 \u00b1 0.0232 0.725 \u00b1 0.0234\n\n\n511 0.7093 \u00b1 0.0228 1.0812 \u00b1 0.028 0.845 \u00b1 0.0226 0.7101 \u00b1 0.0228\n\n\nTABLE IV\n\nC OMPRESSION PERFORMANCE OF THE LLM ON A RECENTLY PUBLISHED BOOK IN P ROJECT G UTENBERG [7], AS A FUNCTION OF ITS MEMORY (M )\n\n\n\nM N c N t\n\n\n\nH ub \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT \u03c1 LLaMA+AC Standalone Zlib\n\n\n(bpc) (bpc) (bpc) (bpc) (bpc)\n\n\n\n31 508, 463 115, 000 1.0919 1.5316 1.2152 1.0924 2.80\n\n\n127 508, 463 115, 000 0.8973 1.3128 1.0235 0.8982 2.80\n\n\n255 508, 463 115, 000 0.8618 1.2684 0.9899 0.8627 2.80\n\n\n511 508, 463 115, 000 0.8417 1.2465 0.9711 0.8426 2.80\n\n\n8\n\n\nR EFERENCES\n\n\n[1] Thomas Cover and Roger King, \u201cA convergent gambling estimate of the entropy of english,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 24, no. 4,\npp. 413\u2013421, 1978.\n\n[2] Shahar Lutati, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf, \u201cFocus your attention (with adaptive IIR filters),\u201d 2023.\n\n[3] Claude E Shannon, \u201cPrediction and entropy of printed english,\u201d Bell system technical journal, vol. 30, no. 1, pp. 50\u201364, 1951.\n\n[4] John Cleary and Ian Witten, \u201cData compression using adaptive coding and partial string matching,\u201d IEEE transactions on Communications, vol. 32, no.\n4, pp. 396\u2013402, 1984.\n\n[5] Mohit Goyal, Kedar Tatwawadi, Shubham Chandak, and Idoia Ochoa, \u201cDeepzip: Lossless data compression using recurrent neural networks,\u201d arXiv\npreprint arXiv:1811.08162, 2018.\n\n[6] Hugo Touvron, Thibaut Lavril, Gautier Izacard, Xavier Martinet, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Timoth\u00e9e Lacroix, Baptiste Rozi\u00e8re, Naman Goyal, Eric Hambro,\nFaisal Azhar, Aurelien Rodriguez, Armand Joulin, Edouard Grave, and Guillaume Lample, \u201cLlama: Open and efficient foundation language models,\u201d\n2023.\n\n[7] J.

This estimate is significantly smaller than currently available\nestimates in [1], [2]. A natural byproduct is an algorithm for lossless compression of English text which combines the prediction\nfrom the large language model with a lossless compression scheme. Preliminary results from limited experiments suggest that our\nscheme outperforms state-of-the-art text compression schemes such as BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.\n\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\n\n\nThere are close connections between learning, prediction, and compression. The success of ChatGPT has captured the\nfascination of general public and brought the connection between learning and prediction to the fore. The main advance\nbrought about by large language models such as LLaMA and GPT-4 is that they excel at predicting the next word (token) in\na paragraph based on knowing the past several words (tokens).\nThe connection between prediction and compression was explored as early as 1951 by Shannon in order to estimate the\nentropy of the English language [3]. The idea that a good predictor for the ith value in a time series based on the past\nvalues can be effectively converted to a good compression algorithm has played a prominent role in information theory. Many\nalgorithms for speech, image, and video compression exploit this idea either explicitly or implicitly. Within the context of\nlossless compression of English text, the idea of combining a language model with arithmetic coding has emerged as a very\neffective paradigm [4]. The performance of such a compression scheme depends substantially on the efficacy of the predictor\nand every time there is a major advance in the prediction capability, it behooves us to study its effect on the compression\nperformance. Indeed, in 2018, the authors of [5] used recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the predictor and reported improved\nresults for certain kinds of sources. Their scheme still did not outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as BSC and ZPAQ\nfor text compression.\nIt is therefore natural at this time to study whether we can obtain better compression results and sharper estimates of the\nentropy of the English language using recent large language models such as LLaMA-7B [6]. This is the main goal of this\npaper. We show that when the LLaMA-7B large language model is used as the predictor, the asymptotic upper bound on the\nentropy is 0.709 bits/character when estimated using a 1MB section of the text8 dataset. This is smaller than earlier estimates\nprovided in [1] and [2, Table 4]. The estimate of the upper bound increases to 0.85 bits/character for a 100 KB section of\nthe text from [7], which is still lower than the estimates in [2]. When LLaMA-7B is combined with an Arithmetic coder for\ncompression, we obtain a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character on a 1MB section of the text8 dataset and a compression\nratio of 0.8426 bits/character on a 100KB section of a text from [7], which are significantly better than the compression ratio\nobtained using BSC, ZPAQ and pq8h on the full 100MB of the text8 dataset.\n\n\nII. I NTUITIVE EXPLANATION OF THE MAIN IDEA\n\n\nWe will use the following example to describe the main idea, which is nearly identical to that proposed by Shannon in [3]\nfor estimating the entropy of English. The main difference is in the use of tokens which represent groups of letters of variable\nlength and in the use of a large language model instead of a human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence\nthat reads as\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\nOur goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can\nbe reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)\n\n\n\u2032 My \u2032, \u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032, \u2032 writing \u2032, \u2032 a \u2032, \u2032 book \u2032\n\n\nA language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the\npast M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in\n\n\n2\n\n\nFigure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be\nwords such as [\u2032] reading [\u2032], [\u2032] writing [\u2032], [\u2032] driving [\u2032], [\u2032] cooking [\u2032] etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in\nour sentence ( [\u2032] writing [\u2032] ) in this list and call it R 5 . We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank\n0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for [\u2032] writing [\u2032] is R 5 = 1.\n\n\nTokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032 My \u2032, \u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n|Col1|LLM|q = Pr(x5|x4 1)<br>5|Rank<br>computation|R5 = 1|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||LLM|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>||\n\n\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreading 0.3\nwriting 0.2\ncycling 0.1\ndriving 0.05\n\n... ...\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nThen, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2\nthrough 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same\nword in the sentence that we wish to encode, [\u2032] a [\u2032], and hence, the rank R 6 would be 0.\n\n\nTokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032, \u2032 writing \u2032\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n|Col1|LLM|q = Pr(x6|x5 2)<br>6|Rank<br>computation|R6 = 0|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||LLM|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>||\n\n\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nan 0.2\n\nthe 0.05\n\n... ...\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nIf the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the\nrank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the\nrank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be\n\n\n1, 0, 0, . . .\n\n\nA sequence with many \u20180\u2019s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the\nranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the\nranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\nSequence of ranks\n\n|e of ranks|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|. ., rNT|Compression (zip)|Nb|\n||||\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.\n\n\nWhen we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language\nmodel one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at\nrank R i during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the\nsame LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.\n\nThe idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the\nprobabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.\n\n\n3\n\n\nIII. C OMPRESSION USING LLM S\n\n\nLet s denote a sentence from the English language composed of N c letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the\nalphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of N T tokens\ndenoted by x = x 1, x 2, . . ., x i\u22121, x i, x i+1, . . . x N T, where x i \u2208X . There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence,\ncompressing s is the same as compressing x. x i \u2019s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the\nupper case letter X i .\nA language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens x i\u2212M, x i\u2212M+1, . . ., x i\u22121\nand produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by\nq i (x i ) := Pr(X i = x i |x i\u22121, x i\u22122, . . ., x i\u2212M ), \u2200x i \u2208X . The PMF vector q i := [q i (1), q i (2), . . ., q i (D)] [T] is sorted in\ndescending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by \u02dcq i . Let \u03b3 i : X \u2192X be a permutation on the integers\nfrom 1 to D such that\n\n\u02dc\nq i (\u03b3 i (j)) = q i (j), \u2200j \u2208X .\n\n\nThat is, \u03b3 i (j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the\ntoken x i at epoch i, r i := \u03b3 i (x i ). The sequence {r i } [N] i=1 [T] [is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to]\nproduce N b bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general,\nthe lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors q i \u2019s in addition to the sequence of ranks.\nThe main metric of interest is the compression ratio \u03c1 defined as\n\n\u03c1 := [N] [b] bits/character.\n\nN c\n\n\n\nLosseless\n\nCompression\n\n\n\nTokens . . ., x i\u2212M, . . ., x i\u22121\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n\nInput sentence s with N c characters\n\n\n\ni i i\u22121 Rank\n\nLLM\ncomputation\n\n\n\nq i = Pr(X i = j|x [i] i [\u2212] \u2212 [M] 1 [)] Rank r i Losseless N b bits\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.\n\n\nA. Entropy bounds\n\n\nLet S \u2208S [\u221e] be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by S n,\nwhereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as S n . The tokenizer parses the input\nstring and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X 1, X 2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, X i is the ith\ntoken. The number of characters employed to generate X i depends on the realization of the random process and, as such,\nwe introduce random variable B i to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical\nconsiderations, we only admit tokenizers for which B i \u2265 1 and B i is uniformly bounded, with B i < B < \u221e; these are\ncharacteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens\ngrows unbounded N T \u2192\u221e, the number of characters must also approach infinity N c \u2192\u221e. Formally, consider the tokenizer\nfunction T : S [N] \u2192X [N] operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S [\u221e] . For\nnatural number, i \u2208 N, define m i : S [N] \u2192 N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an\ninput sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then\n\n\nm i (s) = min n [{][length (][T][ (][s] [n] [))][ \u2265] [i][}][ .] (1)\n\n\nWe note that, by construction, lim n\u2192\u221e length (T (s n )) = \u221e and, as such, m i (\u00b7) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress\nthat the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map\nto the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially\nmay be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances\nwhere T (s n ) = T (s n+1 ). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the\nrestricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted\nset for which T (y n ) = x i is s m i (s) . Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token\n\nas\nb i = m i (s) \u2212 m i\u22121 (s)\n\n\n4\n\n\nwith initial condition m \u22121 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first N T tokens for a random input\nbecomes N c = [\ufffd] i [N] =1 [T] [B] [i] [.]\nHaving established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {S k } [\u221e] k=1 [,]\n{B i } [\u221e] i=1 [, and][ {][X] [i] [}] [\u221e] i=1 [are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that]\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\nn [log] [2] [ p] [S] [n] [(][S] [1] [, . . ., S] [n] [) =][ \u2212] n [1]\n\n\n\nn [log] [2] [ p] [S] [n] [(][S] [n] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][S][)] almost surely. (2)\n\n\n\nLet \u2126 S be the collection of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem\nimplies\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [1] [, . . ., X] [i] [) =][ \u2212] [1] i\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [i] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][X][)] almost surely.

(4)\ni\u2192\u221e i\n\n\nSet \u2126 B to be the set of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. For any \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 S \u2229 \u2126 X \u2229 \u2126 B, we deduce that\n\n\nH(S) = lim\nk\u2192\u221e [\u2212] k [1] [log] [2] [ p] [S] [k] [(][S] [k] [(][\u03c9][))]\n\n= lim i\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i log 2 p S li (S l i (\u03c9))\n\n\n= lim log 2 Pr (X i = T (S l i (\u03c9)))\ni\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i\n\n\n\n1\n\ni [log] [2] [ Pr (][X] [i] [ =][ x] [i] [) =][ H] E [(] B [X][)]\n\n\n\n1 1\n\n= \u2212\nE[B] i [lim] \u2192\u221e i\n\n\n\nE[B] [.]\n\n\n\nThe first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {l i = m i (S(\u03c9))|i \u2208 N} is an infinite\nsubset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately\ngather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following\n\ntwo events,\n{\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|X i (\u03c9) = x i } = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|T (S m i (S(\u03c9)) ) = x i }.\n\n\nThis is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step\nholds because we are considering an \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 B . The sets \u2126 S, \u2126 X, and \u2126 B each have probability one; this implies that their\nintersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that\n\nH(S) = [H][(][X][)] almost surely.\n\nE[B]\n\n\nAs a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to\nexploit.\nThen, from the results of [1], we can see that\n\n\n\nPr\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nH(X) \u2264 lim\nN T \u2192\u221e [\u2212] N [1] T\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd log 2 q i (X i )\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n= 1, (5)\n\n\n\nwhere q i (\u00b7) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is\ngiven by\n\n\n\n\n[1] N T\n\nN T \ufffd i=1 [log] 2 [q] [i] [(][X] [i] [)]\n\n\n\nH(S) \u2264 lim N T \u2192\u221e \u2212 N [1]\n\n\n\n. (6)\nE[B]\n\n\n\nWe refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by H ub . The\nnumerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens X N T and the denominator in (6) is\nthe average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3\nbits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and\ndiscussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance\nof several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc\nis the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.\n\n\nB. Encoding schemes\n\n\nWe consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.\n\n\n5\n\n\n1) Compressing the ranks using zlib: The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks.\nWe refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib .\n2) Token-by-Token Compression: The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a\ntime-varying codebook to encode the token x i at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming q i to be the true distribution of\nthe tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where\n1\nthe codeword for the token x i is of length l i = \u2308log 2 q i (x i ) [\u2309][. A prefix-free code with this length for][ x] [i] [ is guaranteed to exist]\nsince this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT,\nis given by\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n1\nlog 2\n\ufffd q i (x i )\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT =\n\n\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] .\n\n\n\n3) Arithmetic Coding: The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to\ncombine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding\nis well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use q i (x i ) as the probability of token x i at time in the arithmetic\ncoding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as \u03c1 LLM+AC . It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly\noptimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLM+AC \u2248\n\n\n\nN T 1\n\ufffd i=1 log 2 q i (x i )\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] . (7)\n\n\n\nClearly, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and \u03c1 LLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). H ub, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and\n\u03c1 LLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind\nwhen interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.\n\n\nIV. R ESULTS\n\n\nWe used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary\nof size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction\nwith the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase\nletters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet\nis restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between\nthese models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM.\n[Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip)\nLLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ\nalgorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the\npaq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to\nbe best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ\nor paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.\nThe performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average\nperformance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with\nArithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the\nstate-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the\nLLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I\nalso shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by\nShannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].\nThe dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M ) is shown in Table II. As expected, the\ncompression performance improves with increasing M . We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly\nwith the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a\nmemory of 31 tokens.\nIt is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and\nhence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and\ncompression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds\nto estimates obtained from different input sizes.\nIt appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset\nis derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.\n\n\n6\n\n\nTherefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project\nGutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8\ndataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset.\nTable IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the\nentropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper\nbound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of\nLLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression\nratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).\nTo provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors,\nwe also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the\nlast column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm\nmay not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the\nLLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.\n\n\nV.

The document will likely elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation of language model-based text compression.

**I. Compression Using LLMs (Continued from Section III):**
*   **Arithmetic Coding (Section III-B3):** This section will detail how arithmetic coding is used for lossless compression by directly leveraging the time-varying probabilities `q_i(x_i)` produced by the LLM for each token `x_i` at epoch `i`. It will emphasize that arithmetic coding is nearly optimal for compression.
    *   **Equation:** The compression ratio `ρ_LLM+AC` will be approximated by `(Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} -log_2(q_i(x_i))) / (Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`, where `N_T` is the number of tokens and `b_i` is the number of characters in token `x_i`.
    *   **References:** Key references for arithmetic coding include [4] (Cleary and Witten, 1984), [9] (Bell, Witten, and Cleary, 1989), and [10] (MacKay, 2003).
*   **Other Encoding Schemes (Section III-B):**
    *   **Compressing ranks using zlib (Section III-B1):** This scheme, denoted `LLaMA+zlib`, uses the zlib algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks.
    *   **Token-by-Token Compression (Section III-B2):** This method uses a time-varying prefix-free code (e.g., Huffman code) where the codeword length for token `x_i` is `l_i = ⌈log_2(1/q_i(x_i))⌉`, satisfying the Kraft inequality.
        *   **Equation:** The compression ratio `ρ_LLaMA+TbyT` is given by `(Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} log_2(1/q_i(x_i))) / (Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.
        *   **Reference:** The Kraft inequality is referenced to [8] (Cover and Thomas, 1999).

**II. Entropy Bounds (Continued from Section III-A):**
*   **Definitions:**
    *   `S ∈ S^∞`: A random process representing language input. `S_n` is the nth character, `S^n` is the string up to `n`.
    *   `X = X_1, X_2, ...`: A sequence of tokens, `X_i` is the `i`th token.
    *   `B_i`: Random variable for the number of characters in the `i`th token, with `B_i ≥ 1` and `B_i < B < ∞`.
    *   `T: S^N → X^N`: The tokenizer function.
    *   `m_i(s) = min n {length(T(s_n)) ≥ i}`: The time index when the tokenizer outputs its `i`th token.
    *   `b_i = m_i(s) - m_{i-1}(s)`: The number of characters in a token.
    *   `N_c = Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} B_i`: Total characters in `N_T` tokens.
*   **Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8]:** The document will formally state the theorem, indicating that for stationary and ergodic processes, `lim_{n→∞} (-1/n) log_2 p_{S^n}(S_1, ..., S_n) = H(S)` almost surely (Equation 2) and `lim_{i→∞} (-1/i) log_2 p_{X^i}(X_1, ..., X_i) = H(X)` almost surely (Equation 3).
*   **Relationship between Character and Token Entropy:** The document will derive the crucial relationship `H(S) = H(X) / E[B]` almost surely, where `E[B]` is the expected number of characters per token.
*   **Asymptotic Upper Bound on H(S):**
    *   **Equation:** `H(S) ≤ lim_{N_T→∞} (-1/N_T) Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} log_2 q_i(X_i) / E[B]` (Equation 6), denoted as `H_ub`. This `H_ub` represents the average bits required per character.
    *   **References:** The results of [1] (Cover and King, 1978) will be cited for providing earlier estimates of this upper bound.

**III. Results (Section IV):**
*   **LLM and Tokenizer:** The paper will detail the use of LLaMA-7B [6] as the language model and the SentencePiece tokenizer [11] with a dictionary size of 32000.
*   **Datasets:** Performance evaluation will be presented using the text8 dataset (1MB and 100MB sections) [http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip] and a book from Project Gutenberg [7].
*   **Baselines:** Comparison will be made against state-of-the-art text compression algorithms like BSC, ZPAQ [5], and paq8h [12].
*   **Performance Metrics:** The compression ratio (bits/character) for `LLaMA+zlib`, `LLaMA+TbyT`, and `LLM+AC` will be presented, showing that `LLM+AC` achieves significantly better results (e.g., 0.7101 bpc on text8) than existing methods.
*   **Impact of Memory (M):** The document will show that compression performance improves with increasing LLM memory `M`.
*   **Caveats:** Discussions will include the potential for optimistic results on text8 due to LLaMA-7B's training on Wikipedia, and the variance of compression ratio estimates.

**IV. Acknowledgement (Section V):**
*   The authors will acknowledge contributions, such as discussions that motivated the inclusion of arithmetic coding results.

**V. References:**
*   The document will include a comprehensive list of references, including foundational works in information theory (e.g., Shannon [3], Cover and Thomas [8]), and recent works on LLMs and compression [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12].[00m

The document will likely elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation of language model-based text compression.

**I. Compression Using LLMs (Continued from Section III):**
*   **Arithmetic Coding (Section III-B3):** This section will detail how arithmetic coding is used for lossless compression by directly leveraging the time-varying probabilities `q_i(x_i)` produced by the LLM for each token `x_i` at epoch `i`. It will emphasize that arithmetic coding is nearly optimal for compression.
    *   **Equation:** The compression ratio `ρ_LLM+AC` will be approximated by `(Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} -log_2(q_i(x_i))) / (Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`, where `N_T` is the number of tokens and `b_i` is the number of characters in token `x_i`.
    *   **References:** Key references for arithmetic coding include [4] (Cleary and Witten, 1984), [9] (Bell, Witten, and Cleary, 1989), and [10] (MacKay, 2003).
*   **Other Encoding Schemes (Section III-B):**
    *   **Compressing ranks using zlib (Section III-B1):** This scheme, denoted `LLaMA+zlib`, uses the zlib algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks.
    *   **Token-by-Token Compression (Section III-B2):** This method uses a time-varying prefix-free code (e.g., Huffman code) where the codeword length for token `x_i` is `l_i = ⌈log_2(1/q_i(x_i))⌉`, satisfying the Kraft inequality.
        *   **Equation:** The compression ratio `ρ_LLaMA+TbyT` is given by `(Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} log_2(1/q_i(x_i))) / (Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.
        *   **Reference:** The Kraft inequality is referenced to [8] (Cover and Thomas, 1999).

**II. Entropy Bounds (Continued from Section III-A):**
*   **Definitions:**
    *   `S ∈ S^∞`: A random process representing language input. `S_n` is the nth character, `S^n` is the string up to `n`.
    *   `X = X_1, X_2, ...`: A sequence of tokens, `X_i` is the `i`th token.
    *   `B_i`: Random variable for the number of characters in the `i`th token, with `B_i ≥ 1` and `B_i < B < ∞`.
    *   `T: S^N → X^N`: The tokenizer function.
    *   `m_i(s) = min n {length(T(s_n)) ≥ i}`: The time index when the tokenizer outputs its `i`th token.
    *   `b_i = m_i(s) - m_{i-1}(s)`: The number of characters in a token.
    *   `N_c = Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} B_i`: Total characters in `N_T` tokens.
*   **Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8]:** The document will formally state the theorem, indicating that for stationary and ergodic processes, `lim_{n→∞} (-1/n) log_2 p_{S^n}(S_1, ..., S_n) = H(S)` almost surely (Equation 2) and `lim_{i→∞} (-1/i) log_2 p_{X^i}(X_1, ..., X_i) = H(X)` almost surely (Equation 3).
*   **Relationship between Character and Token Entropy:** The document will derive the crucial relationship `H(S) = H(X) / E[B]` almost surely, where `E[B]` is the expected number of characters per token.
*   **Asymptotic Upper Bound on H(S):**
    *   **Equation:** `H(S) ≤ lim_{N_T→∞} (-1/N_T) Σ_{i=1}^{N_T} log_2 q_i(X_i) / E[B]` (Equation 6), denoted as `H_ub`. This `H_ub` represents the average bits required per character.
    *   **References:** The results of [1] (Cover and King, 1978) will be cited for providing earlier estimates of this upper bound.

**III. Results (Section IV):**
*   **LLM and Tokenizer:** The paper will detail the use of LLaMA-7B [6] as the language model and the SentencePiece tokenizer [11] with a dictionary size of 32000.
*   **Datasets:** Performance evaluation will be presented using the text8 dataset (1MB and 100MB sections) [http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip] and a book from Project Gutenberg [7].
*   **Baselines:** Comparison will be made against state-of-the-art text compression algorithms like BSC, ZPAQ [5], and paq8h [12].
*   **Performance Metrics:** The compression ratio (bits/character) for `LLaMA+zlib`, `LLaMA+TbyT`, and `LLM+AC` will be presented, showing that `LLM+AC` achieves significantly better results (e.g., 0.7101 bpc on text8) than existing methods.
*   **Impact of Memory (M):** The document will show that compression performance improves with increasing LLM memory `M`.
*   **Caveats:** Discussions will include the potential for optimistic results on text8 due to LLaMA-7B's training on Wikipedia, and the variance of compression ratio estimates.

**IV. Acknowledgement (Section V):**
