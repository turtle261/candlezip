│  ## Strategic Plan for Document Content Retrieval                           │
│                                                                             │
│  ### 1. Understanding of the Task                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  As an AI Assistant, I understand this task as a focused information        │
│  retrieval challenge. My primary goal is to act as a deterministic          │
│  research agent, predicting and extracting specific, factual content that   │
│  is highly likely to appear later in the provided document, given its       │
│  observed prefix. This content must be directly supported by available      │
│  tools and presented concisely for conditioning a language model            │
│  compressor. The emphasis is on accuracy, relevance, and avoiding           │
│  hallucination. The document prefix clearly outlines a research paper       │
│  discussing language model (LLaMA-7B) based text compression, its           │
│  performance, and comparisons with other algorithms and entropy bounds. It  │
│  also explicitly mentions several tables (Table I, II, III, IV) and         │
│  numbered references that are either partially presented or yet to be       │
│  presented.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ### 2. Key Steps to Complete the Task                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Identify the specific research paper**: The prefix contains enough   │
│  unique keywords (LLaMA-7B, text8 dataset, Arithmetic Coding, ZPAQ, paq8h,  │
│  Project Gutenberg book, specific compression ratios like 0.7101 bpc) to    │
│  pinpoint the exact document.                                               │
│  2.  **Retrieve the full document**: Once identified, I will use the        │
│  appropriate tool to download and access the full text of the paper.        │
│  3.  **Locate and extract missing table data**:                             │
│      *   Complete the partial "TABLE III" by finding its full content.      │
│      *   Locate and extract the entire "TABLE IV" as explicitly mentioned   │
│  in the prefix.                                                             │
│  4.  **Locate and extract Equation (6)**: The prefix refers to "the upper   │
│  bound in (6)". I will search for this equation's definition.               │
│  5.  **Locate and extract full bibliographic references**: The prefix uses  │
│  several numbered references ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12]). I  │
│  will find the "References" section and extract the full details for each.  │
│  6.  **Identify any immediate subsequent discussion**: After Table IV,      │
│  there might be further analysis, conclusions, or future work that          │
│  directly follows the presented results. I will scan for this.              │
│  7.  **Synthesize the synopsis**: Compile all extracted information into a  │
│  concise, factual text, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future    │
│  content and is suitable for a language model compressor.                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ### 3. Approach to Challenges                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Identifying the correct paper**: If initial broad searches yield     │
│  too many results or none, I will refine my search query using more         │
│  specific combinations of keywords, authors (if any can be inferred), or    │
│  even by searching for papers that cite or are cited by the mentioned       │
│  references (e.g., the LLaMA paper [6]). The specific compression ratios    │
│  and dataset names are strong discriminators.                               │
│  *   **Extracting structured data (tables, equations, references)**: I      │
│  will rely on the `read_paper` tool's ability to provide the full text. I   │
│  will then use string matching, regular expressions, or section navigation  │
│  (if `get_sections` is effective) to precisely locate and extract the       │
│  required data. For tables, I will parse the text to reconstruct the table  │
│  structure. For references, I will look for the "References" or             │
│  "Bibliography" section.                                                    │
│  *   **Ensuring conciseness and relevance**: I will strictly adhere to the  │
│  information requested (facts, equations, definitions, datasets,            │
│  references) and avoid extraneous details. The synopsis will be a direct    │
│  presentation of the extracted content.                                     │
│  *   **Avoiding hallucination**: Every piece of information in the          │
│  synopsis will be directly quoted or accurately summarized from the         │
│  retrieved document, with no inferred or fabricated content.                │
│                                                                             │
│  ### 4. Strategic Use of Available Tools                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **`search_papers(query: str)`**:                                       │
│      *   **Purpose**: To find the specific research paper from which the    │
│  prefix is taken.                                                           │
│      *   **Execution**: I will start with a precise query: `"LLaMA-7B       │
│  compression arithmetic coding text8 Project Gutenberg"`. If this is too    │
│  narrow, I will broaden it to `"LLaMA-7B compression text8"` or `"LLaMA-7B  │
│  entropy estimation"`. I will look for papers published around 2023, given  │
│  the mention of a "May 25, 2023" book.                                      │
│  2.  **`download_paper(paper_id: str)`**:                                   │
│      *   **Purpose**: To obtain the full content of the identified paper.   │
│      *   **Execution**: Once `search_papers` returns a likely candidate     │
│  (or candidates), I will use the `paper_id` to download the full text.      │
│  3.  **`read_paper(paper_id: str)`**:                                       │
│      *   **Purpose**: To access and parse the entire content of the         │
│  downloaded paper to extract the required information.                      │
│      *   **Execution**: After downloading, I will use `read_paper` to get   │
│  the raw text. I will then programmatically search this text for:           │
│          *   "TABLE III" and extract the remaining rows.                    │
│          *   "TABLE IV" and extract its full content.                       │
│          *   "Equation (6)" or "(6)" to find its definition.                │
│          *   The "References" section to extract entries for [1], [2],      │
│  [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12].                                            │
│          *   Text immediately following "Table IV shows the compression     │
│  performance..." for further discussion.                                    │
│  4.  **`get_sections(paper_id: str)` (Contingency)**:                       │
│      *   **Purpose**: If direct text search within `read_paper` proves      │
│  difficult for navigation, this tool could help identify the "Results",     │
│  "References", or "Conclusion" sections to narrow down the search area.     │
│      *   **Execution**: I would use this to get a list of section titles    │
│  and then focus my `read_paper` parsing on the relevant sections.           │
│                                                                             │
│  ### 5. Expected Outcome                                                    │
│                                                                             │

## IV. RESULTS

We used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary of size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction with the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase letters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet is restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between these models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM. Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of LLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ algorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the paq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ or paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.

The performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average performance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the state-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the LLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I also shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by Shannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].

The dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) is shown in Table II. As expected, the compression performance improves with increasing M. We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly with the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a memory of 31 tokens.

It is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA-7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds to estimates obtained from different input sizes.

It appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset is derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.

Therefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project Gutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8 dataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset. Table IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the entropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of LLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression ratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).

To provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors, we also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the last column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm may not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the LLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.

Reasoning Plan:
## Strategic Plan for Document Content Retrieval

### 1. Understanding of the Task

As an AI Assistant, I understand this task as a focused information retrieval challenge. My primary goal is to act as a deterministic research agent, predicting and extracting specific, factual content that is highly likely to appear later in the provided document, given its observed prefix. This content must be directly supported by available tools and presented concisely for conditioning a language model compressor. The emphasis is on accuracy, relevance, and avoiding hallucination. The document prefix clearly outlines a research paper discussing language model (LLaMA-7B) based text compression, its performance, and comparisons with other algorithms and entropy bounds. It also explicitly mentions several tables (Table I, II, III, IV) and numbered references that are either partially presented or yet to be presented.

### 2. Key Steps to Complete the Task

1.  **Identify the specific research paper**: The prefix contains enough unique keywords (LLaMA-7B, text8 dataset, Arithmetic Coding, ZPAQ, paq8h, Project Gutenberg book, specific compression ratios like 0.7101 bpc) to pinpoint the exact document.
2.  **Retrieve the full document**: Once identified, I will use the appropriate tool to download and access the full text of the paper.
3.  **Locate and extract missing table data**:
    *   Complete the partial "TABLE III" by finding its full content.
    *   Locate and extract the entire "TABLE IV" as explicitly mentioned in the prefix.
4.  **Locate and extract Equation (6)**: The prefix refers to "the upper bound in (6)". I will search for this equation's definition.
5.  **Locate and extract full bibliographic references**: The prefix uses several numbered references ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12]). I will find the "References" section and extract the full details for each.
6.  **Identify any immediate subsequent discussion**: After Table IV, there might be further analysis, conclusions, or future work that directly follows the presented results. I will scan for this.
7.  **Synthesize the synopsis**: Compile all extracted information into a concise, factual text, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future content and is suitable for a language model compressor.

### 3. Approach to Challenges

*   **Identifying the correct paper**: If initial broad searches yield too many results or none, I will refine my search query using more specific combinations of keywords, authors (if any can be inferred), or even by searching for papers that cite or are cited by the mentioned references (e.g., the LLaMA paper [6]). The specific compression ratios and dataset names are strong discriminators.
*   **Extracting structured data (tables, equations, references)**: I will rely on the `read_paper` tool's ability to provide the full text. I will then use string matching, regular expressions, or section navigation (if `get_sections` is effective) to precisely locate and extract the required data. For tables, I will parse the text to reconstruct the table structure. For references, I will look for the "References" or "Bibliography" section.
*   **Ensuring conciseness and relevance**: I will strictly adhere to the information requested (facts, equations, definitions, datasets, references) and avoid extraneous details. The synopsis will be a direct presentation of the extracted content.
*   **Avoiding hallucination**: Every piece of information in the synopsis will be directly quoted or accurately summarized from the retrieved document, with no inferred or fabricated content.

### 4. Strategic Use of Available Tools

1.  **`search_papers(query: str)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: To find the specific research paper from which the prefix is taken.
    *   **Execution**: I will start with a precise query: `"LLaMA-7B compression arithmetic coding text8 Project Gutenberg"`. If this is too narrow, I will broaden it to `"LLaMA-7B compression text8"` or `"LLaMA-7B entropy estimation"`. I will look for papers published around 2023, given the mention of a "May 25, 2023" book.
2.  **`download_paper(paper_id: str)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: To obtain the full content of the identified paper.
    *   **Execution**: Once `search_papers` returns a likely candidate (or candidates), I will use the `paper_id` to download the full text.
3.  **`read_paper(paper_id: str)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: To access and parse the entire content of the downloaded paper to extract the required information.
    *   **Execution**: After downloading, I will use `read_paper` to get the raw text. I will then programmatically search this text for:
        *   "TABLE III" and extract the remaining rows.
        *   "TABLE IV" and extract its full content.
        *   "Equation (6)" or "(6)" to find its definition.
        *   The "References" section to extract entries for [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12].
        *   Text immediately following "Table IV shows the compression performance..." for further discussion.
4.  **`get_sections(paper_id: str)` (Contingency)**:
    *   **Purpose**: If direct text search within `read_paper` proves difficult for navigation, this tool could help identify the "Results", "References", or "Conclusion" sections to narrow down the search area.
    *   **Execution**: I would use this to get a list of section titles and then focus my `read_paper` parsing on the relevant sections.

### 5. Expected Outcome

The expected outcome is a concise, plain-text synopsis that accurately presents the following information, directly extracted from the full document:

*   The complete "TABLE III" (mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios).
*   The complete "TABLE IV" (compression performance of LLM on the Project Gutenberg book).
*   The definition or content of "Equation (6)".
*   The full bibliographic details for references [1] (Cover and King), [2] (neural network estimates), [3] (Shannon), [5] (ZPAQ), [6] (LLaMA-7B), [7] (Project Gutenberg book), [11] (SentencePiece), and [12] (paq8h).
*   Any immediate follow-up discussion or conclusions presented directly after Table IV in the document.

This outcome will directly fulfill the task requirements by providing likely future content, maximizing relevance, and adhering to the constraint of not hallucinating.

      "abstract": "Discrete diffusion has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in discrete\ndata modeling. However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate\ntransition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of\nlatent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also\nconstrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose\nDiscrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete\nrepresentation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix\nLearning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis,\nestablishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the\nconvergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space\ncomplexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior\nstudies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)\nof 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover,\nthe proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10\ndataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific\ngeneration approaches.",

      "abstract": "While the language modeling objective has been shown to be deeply connected\nwith compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed in\npractical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depth\nanalysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to\nanswer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with\nneural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based\nsystems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are\nhighly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system\nusing Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with\nhuge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip -\na novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online\nmemorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely.\nFineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5\ndays, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip\noutperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin,\nimproving compression ratios by approximately 50\\%. With this work, we take the\nfirst step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While\nFineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a\nviable solution for large-scale text compression. We hope our work paves the\nway for future research and innovation to solve this problem.",

We also demonstrate the empirical importance of\ncompression for downstream success of pre-trained language models. We control\nthe compression ability of several BPE tokenizers by varying the amount of\ndocuments available during their training: from 1 million documents to a\ncharacter-based tokenizer equivalent to no training data at all. We then\npre-train English language models based on those tokenizers and fine-tune them\nover several tasks. We show that there is a correlation between tokenizers'\ncompression and models' downstream performance, suggesting that compression is\na reliable intrinsic indicator of tokenization quality. These correlations are\nmore pronounced for generation tasks (over classification) or for smaller\nmodels (over large ones). We replicated a representative part of our\nexperiments on Turkish and found similar results, confirming that our results\nhold for languages with typological characteristics dissimilar to English. We\nconclude that building better compressing tokenizers is a fruitful avenue for\nfurther research and for improving overall model performance.",

We lack methods to reliably describe how their representations are\nstructured, how that structure emerges over training, and what kinds of\nstructures are desirable. This thesis introduces quantitative methods for\nidentifying systematic structure in a mapping between spaces, and leverages\nthem to understand how deep-learning models learn to represent information,\nwhat representational structures drive generalisation, and how design decisions\ncondition the structures that emerge. To do this I identify structural\nprimitives present in a mapping, along with information theoretic\nquantifications of each.

Incidentally, in recent years, the machine\nlearning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful\nself-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit\nimpressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong\ncompressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem\nthrough the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of\nlarge (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful\ngeneral-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel\ninsights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example,\nChinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to\n43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, beating\ndomain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%), respectively.\nFinally, we show that the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use\nany compressor (like gzip) to build a conditional generative model.",

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The search results show a few papers related to LLM compression. The paper "Language Modeling Is Compression" (2309.10668v2) by Delétang et al. seems highly relevant, especially given its abstract mentions "large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning." However, it doesn't explicitly mention "LLaMA-7B" or "text8 dataset" in the abstract in the same way the document prefix does.
The document prefix mentions LLaMA-7B, text8 dataset, Project Gutenberg, and specific compression ratios (e.g., 0.7101 bpc). None of the abstracts directly match all these specific details. The paper "FineZip : Pushing the Limits of Large Language Models for Practical Lossless Text Compression" (2409.17141v1) mentions LLMZip and Llama3-8B, but not LLaMA-7B.
Let's refine the search to be more specific to "LLaMA-7B" and "text8 dataset" and "Project Gutenberg" to try and find the exact paper. I will also remove the date constraint to broaden the search, as the paper might be slightly older or newer than my initial assumption.[00m

      "abstract": "Discrete diffusion has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in discrete\ndata modeling. However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate\ntransition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of\nlatent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also\nconstrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose\nDiscrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete\nrepresentation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix\nLearning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis,\nestablishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the\nconvergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space\ncomplexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior\nstudies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)\nof 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover,\nthe proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10\ndataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific\ngeneration approaches.",

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The refined search still didn't yield the exact paper. The specific compression ratio "0.7101 bits/character" is a very strong indicator, as is the combination of LLaMA-7B, text8, and Project Gutenberg. It's possible the paper is not yet on arXiv or is under a slightly different title/keywords.
Given the detailed information in the prefix, especially the specific references [6] (LLaMA-7B) and [11] (SentencePiece tokenizer), I can try to find the LLaMA-7B paper and then look for papers that cite it and also discuss text compression on text8. However, that's a more complex multi-step process.
Let's try a broader search for "LLaMA-7B text compression entropy" without the specific compression ratio, as that might be too restrictive. I will also include "arXiv" in the query to ensure I'm looking for papers on that platform.[00m

To overcome this, we present FineZip -\na novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online\nmemorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely.\nFineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5\ndays, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip\noutperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin,\nimproving compression ratios by approximately 50\\%.

      "abstract": "Contemporary natural language processing (NLP) revolves around learning from\nlatent document representations, generated either implicitly by neural language\nmodels or explicitly by methods such as doc2vec or similar. One of the key\nproperties of the obtained representations is their dimension. Whilst the\ncommonly adopted dimensions of 256 and 768 offer sufficient performance on many\ntasks, it is many times unclear whether the default dimension is the most\nsuitable choice for the subsequent downstream learning tasks. Furthermore,\nrepresentation dimensions are seldom subject to hyperparameter tuning due to\ncomputational constraints. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a\nsurprisingly simple and efficient recursive compression procedure can be\nsufficient to both significantly compress the initial representation, but also\npotentially improve its performance when considering the task of text\nclassification. Having smaller and less noisy representations is the desired\nproperty during deployment, as orders of magnitude smaller models can\nsignificantly reduce the computational overload and with it the deployment\ncosts. We propose CoRe, a straightforward, representation learner-agnostic\nframework suitable for representation compression. The CoRe's performance is\nshowcased and studied on a collection of 17 real-life corpora from biomedical,\nnews, social media, and literary domains. We explored CoRe's behavior when\nconsidering contextual and non-contextual document representations, different\ncompression levels, and 9 different compression algorithms. Current results\nbased on more than 100,000 compression experiments indicate that recursive\nSingular Value Decomposition offers a very good trade-off between the\ncompression efficiency and performance, making CoRe useful in many existing,\nrepresentation-dependent NLP pipelines.",

      "abstract": "Despite it being the cornerstone of BPE, the most common tokenization\nalgorithm, the importance of compression in the tokenization process is still\nunclear. In this paper, we argue for the theoretical importance of compression,\nthat can be viewed as 0-gram language modeling where equal probability is\nassigned to all tokens. We also demonstrate the empirical importance of\ncompression for downstream success of pre-trained language models. We control\nthe compression ability of several BPE tokenizers by varying the amount of\ndocuments available during their training: from 1 million documents to a\ncharacter-based tokenizer equivalent to no training data at all. We then\npre-train English language models based on those tokenizers and fine-tune them\nover several tasks. We show that there is a correlation between tokenizers'\ncompression and models' downstream performance, suggesting that compression is\na reliable intrinsic indicator of tokenization quality. These correlations are\nmore pronounced for generation tasks (over classification) or for smaller\nmodels (over large ones). We replicated a representative part of our\nexperiments on Turkish and found similar results, confirming that our results\nhold for languages with typological characteristics dissimilar to English. We\nconclude that building better compressing tokenizers is a fruitful avenue for\nfurther research and for improving overall model performance.",

While prompting is a crucial tool\nfor LLM inference, we observe that there is a significant cost associated with\nexceedingly lengthy prompts. Existing attempts to compress lengthy prompts lead\nto substandard results in terms of readability/interpretability of the\ncompressed prompt, with a detrimental impact on prompt utility. To address\nthis, we propose PromptSAW: Prompt compresSion via Relation AWare graphs, an\neffective strategy for prompt compression over task-agnostic and task-aware\nprompts. Prompt-SAW uses the prompt's textual information to build a graph and\nlater extracts key information elements in the graph to come up with the\ncompressed prompt. We also propose GSM8K-aug, i.e., an extended version of the\nexisting GSM8K benchmark for task-agnostic prompts in order to provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation platform. Experimental evaluation using benchmark\ndatasets shows that prompts compressed by Prompt-SAW are not only better in\nterms of readability, but they also outperform the best-performing baseline\nmodels by up to 10.1 and 77.1, respectively, for task-agnostic and task-aware\nsettings while compressing the original prompt text by 34.9 and 56.7.",

      "abstract": "As text-to-image models grow increasingly powerful and complex, their\nburgeoning size presents a significant obstacle to widespread adoption,\nespecially on resource-constrained devices. This paper presents a pioneering\nstudy on post-training pruning of Stable Diffusion 2, addressing the critical\nneed for model compression in text-to-image domain. Our study tackles the\npruning techniques for the previously unexplored multi-modal generation models,\nand particularly examines the pruning impact on the textual component and the\nimage generation component separately. We conduct a comprehensive comparison on\npruning the model or the single component of the model in various sparsities.\nOur results yield previously undocumented findings. For example, contrary to\nestablished trends in language model pruning, we discover that simple magnitude\npruning outperforms more advanced techniques in text-to-image context.\nFurthermore, our results show that Stable Diffusion 2 can be pruned to 38.5%\nsparsity with minimal quality loss, achieving a significant reduction in model\nsize. We propose an optimal pruning configuration that prunes the text encoder\nto 47.5% and the diffusion generator to 35%. This configuration maintains image\ngeneration quality while substantially reducing computational requirements. In\naddition, our work uncovers intriguing questions about information encoding in\ntext-to-image models: we observe that pruning beyond certain thresholds leads\nto sudden performance drops (unreadable images), suggesting that specific\nweights encode critical semantics information. This finding opens new avenues\nfor future research in model compression, interoperability, and bias\nidentification in text-to-image models. By providing crucial insights into the\npruning behavior of text-to-image models, our study lays the groundwork for\ndeveloping more efficient and accessible AI-driven image generation systems",

To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose PPC-GPT, a innovative privacy-preserving federated\nframework specifically designed for compressing LLMs into task-specific SLMs\nvia pruning and Chain-of-Thought (COT) distillation. PPC-GPT works on a\nserver-client federated architecture, where the client sends differentially\nprivate (DP) perturbed task-specific data to the server's LLM. The LLM then\ngenerates synthetic data along with their corresponding rationales. This\nsynthetic data is subsequently used for both LLM pruning and retraining\nprocesses. Additionally, we harness COT knowledge distillation, leveraging the\nsynthetic data to further improve the retraining of structurally-pruned SLMs.\nOur experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPC-GPT across\nvarious text generation tasks.

Tool Description: Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering and query optimization.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Use QUOTED PHRASES for exact matches: "multi-agent systems", "neural networks", "machine learning"
- Combine related concepts with OR: "AI agents" OR "software agents" OR "intelligent agents"  
- Use field-specific searches for precision:
  - ti:"exact title phrase" - search in titles only
  - au:"author name" - search by author
  - abs:"keyword" - search in abstracts only
- Use ANDNOT to exclude unwanted results: "machine learning" ANDNOT "survey"
- For best results, use 2-4 core concepts rather than long keyword lists

ADVANCED SEARCH PATTERNS:
- Field + phrase: ti:"transformer architecture" for papers with exact title phrase
- Multiple fields: au:"Smith" AND ti:"quantum" for author Smith's quantum papers  
- Exclusions: "deep learning" ANDNOT ("survey" OR "review") to exclude survey papers
- Broad + narrow: "artificial intelligence" AND (robotics OR "computer vision")

CATEGORY FILTERING (highly recommended for relevance):
- cs.AI: Artificial Intelligence
- cs.MA: Multi-Agent Systems  
- cs.LG: Machine Learning
- cs.CL: Computation and Language (NLP)
- cs.CV: Computer Vision
- cs.RO: Robotics
- cs.HC: Human-Computer Interaction
- cs.CR: Cryptography and Security
- cs.DB: Databases

EXAMPLES OF EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
- ti:"reinforcement learning" with categories: ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"] - for RL papers by title
- au:"Hinton" AND "deep learning" with categories: ["cs.LG"] - for Hinton's deep learning work
- "multi-agent" ANDNOT "survey" with categories: ["cs.MA"] - exclude survey papers
- abs:"transformer" AND ti:"attention" with categories: ["cs.CL"] - attention papers with transformer abstracts

DATE FILTERING: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for historical research:
- date_to: "2015-12-31" - for foundational/classic work (pre-2016)
- date_from: "2020-01-01" - for recent developments (post-2020)
- Both together for specific time periods

RESULT QUALITY: Results sorted by RELEVANCE (most relevant papers first), not just newest papers.
This ensures you get the most pertinent results regardless of publication date.

TIPS FOR FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH:
- Use date_to: "2010-12-31" to find classic papers on BDI, SOAR, ACT-R
- Combine with field searches: ti:"BDI" AND abs:"belief desire intention"  
- Try author searches: au:"Rao" AND "BDI" for Anand Rao's foundational BDI work

│                                                                             │
│  As an AI Assistant, I understand this task as a focused information        │
│  retrieval challenge. My primary goal is to act as a deterministic          │
│  research agent, predicting and extracting specific, factual content that   │
│  is highly likely to appear later in the provided document, given its       │
│  observed prefix. This content must be directly supported by available      │
│  tools and presented concisely for conditioning a language model            │
│  compressor. The emphasis is on accuracy, relevance, and avoiding           │
│  hallucination. The document prefix clearly outlines a research paper       │
│  discussing language model (LLaMA-7B) based text compression, its           │
│  performance, and comparisons with other algorithms and entropy bounds. It  │
│  also explicitly mentions several tables (Table I, II, III, IV) and         │
│  numbered references that are either partially presented or yet to be       │
│  presented.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ### 2. Key Steps to Complete the Task                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Identify the specific research paper**: The prefix contains enough   │
│  unique keywords (LLaMA-7B, text8 dataset, Arithmetic Coding, ZPAQ, paq8h,  │
│  Project Gutenberg book, specific compression ratios like 0.7101 bpc) to    │
│  pinpoint the exact document.                                               │
│  2.  **Retrieve the full document**: Once identified, I will use the        │
│  appropriate tool to download and access the full text of the paper.        │
│  3.  **Locate and extract missing table data**:                             │
│      *   Complete the partial "TABLE III" by finding its full content.      │
│      *   Locate and extract the entire "TABLE IV" as explicitly mentioned   │
│  in the prefix.                                                             │
│  4.  **Locate and extract Equation (6)**: The prefix refers to "the upper   │
│  bound in (6)". I will search for this equation's definition.               │
│  5.  **Locate and extract full bibliographic references**: The prefix uses  │
│  several numbered references ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12]). I  │
│  will find the "References" section and extract the full details for each.  │
│  6.  **Identify any immediate subsequent discussion**: After the            │
│  discussion about zlib performance (the end of the provided prefix), there  │
│  might be further analysis, conclusions, or future work that directly       │
│  follows the presented results. I will scan for this.                       │
│  7.  **Synthesize the synopsis**: Compile all extracted information into a  │
│  concise, factual text, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future    │
│  content and is suitable for a language model compressor.                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ### 3. Approach to Challenges                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Identifying the correct paper**: If initial broad searches yield     │
│  too many results or none, I will refine my search query using more         │
│  specific combinations of keywords, authors (if any can be inferred), or    │
│  even by searching for papers that cite or are cited by the mentioned       │
│  references (e.g., the LLaMA paper [6]). The specific compression ratios    │
│  and dataset names are strong discriminators.                               │
│  *   **Extracting structured data (tables, equations, references)**: I      │
│  will rely on the `read_paper` tool's ability to provide the full text. I   │
│  will then use string matching, regular expressions, or section navigation  │
│  (if `get_sections` is effective) to precisely locate and extract the       │
│  required data. For tables, I will parse the text to reconstruct the table  │
│  structure. For references, I will look for the "References" or             │
│  "Bibliography" section.                                                    │
│  *   **Ensuring conciseness and relevance**: I will strictly adhere to the  │
│  information requested (facts, equations, definitions, datasets,            │
│  references) and avoid extraneous details. The synopsis will be a direct    │
│  presentation of the extracted content.                                     │
│  *   **Avoiding hallucination**: Every piece of information in the          │
│  synopsis will be directly quoted or accurately summarized from the         │
│  retrieved document, with no inferred or fabricated content.                │
│                                                                             │
│  ### 4. Strategic Use of Available Tools                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **`search_papers(query: str)`**:                                       │
│      *   **Purpose**: To find the specific research paper from which the    │
│  prefix is taken.                                                           │
│      *   **Execution**: I will start with a precise query: `LLaMA-7B text   │
│  compression text8 Project Gutenberg arithmetic coding 0.7101 bpc`. I will  │
│  look for papers published around 2023, given the mention of a "May 25,     │
│  2023" book.                                                                │
│  2.  **`download_paper(paper_id: str)`**:                                   │
│      *   **Purpose**: To obtain the full content of the identified paper.   │
│      *   **Execution**: Once `search_papers` returns a likely candidate     │
│  (or candidates), I will use the `paper_id` to download the full text.      │
│  3.  **`read_paper(paper_id: str)`**:                                       │
│      *   **Purpose**: To access and parse the entire content of the         │
│  downloaded paper to extract the required information.                      │
│      *   **Execution**: After downloading, I will use `read_paper` to get   │
│  the raw text. I will then programmatically search this text for:           │
│          *   "TABLE III" and extract the remaining rows and columns to      │
│  complete the table.                                                        │
│          *   "TABLE IV" and extract its full content.                       │
│          *   "Equation (6)" or "(6)" to find its definition.                │
│          *   The "References" section to extract entries for [1], [2],      │
│  [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12].                                            │
│          *   Text immediately following the last sentence of the prefix:    │
│  "The zlib algorithm may not be optimized for compressing small text        │
│  samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the    │
│  LLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts." This will help identify   │
│  any immediate subsequent discussion, conclusions, or future work.          │
│  4.  **`get_sections(paper_id: str)` (Contingency)**:                       │
│      *   **Purpose**: If direct text search within `read_paper` proves      │
│  difficult for navigation, this tool could help identify the "Results",     │
│  "References", or "Conclusion" sections to narrow down the search area.     │
│      *   **Execution**: I would use this to get a list of section titles    │
│  and then focus my `read_paper` parsing on the relevant sections.           │
│                                                                             │

## IV. RESULTS

We used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary of size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction with the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase letters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet is restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between these models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM. Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of LLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ algorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the paq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ or paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.

The performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average performance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the state-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the LLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I also shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by Shannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].

The dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) is shown in Table II. As expected, the compression performance improves with increasing M. We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly with the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a memory of 31 tokens.

It is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA-7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds to estimates obtained from different input sizes.

It appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset is derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.

Therefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project Gutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8 dataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset. Table IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the entropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of LLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression ratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).

To provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors, we also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the last column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm may not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the LLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.

Reasoning Plan:
## Strategic Plan for Document Content Retrieval

### 1. Understanding of the Task

As an AI Assistant, I understand this task as a focused information retrieval challenge. My primary goal is to act as a deterministic research agent, predicting and extracting specific, factual content that is highly likely to appear later in the provided document, given its observed prefix. This content must be directly supported by available tools and presented concisely for conditioning a language model compressor. The emphasis is on accuracy, relevance, and avoiding hallucination. The document prefix clearly outlines a research paper discussing language model (LLaMA-7B) based text compression, its performance, and comparisons with other algorithms and entropy bounds. It also explicitly mentions several tables (Table I, II, III, IV) and numbered references that are either partially presented or yet to be presented.

### 2. Key Steps to Complete the Task

1.  **Identify the specific research paper**: The prefix contains enough unique keywords (LLaMA-7B, text8 dataset, Arithmetic Coding, ZPAQ, paq8h, Project Gutenberg book, specific compression ratios like 0.7101 bpc) to pinpoint the exact document.
2.  **Retrieve the full document**: Once identified, I will use the appropriate tool to download and access the full text of the paper.
3.  **Locate and extract missing table data**:
    *   Complete the partial "TABLE III" by finding its full content.
    *   Locate and extract the entire "TABLE IV" as explicitly mentioned in the prefix.
4.  **Locate and extract Equation (6)**: The prefix refers to "the upper bound in (6)". I will search for this equation's definition.
5.  **Locate and extract full bibliographic references**: The prefix uses several numbered references ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12]). I will find the "References" section and extract the full details for each.
6.  **Identify any immediate subsequent discussion**: After Table IV, there might be further analysis, conclusions, or future work that directly follows the presented results. I will scan for this.
7.  **Synthesize the synopsis**: Compile all extracted information into a concise, factual text, ensuring it directly addresses the likely future content and is suitable for a language model compressor.

### 3. Approach to Challenges

*   **Identifying the correct paper**: If initial broad searches yield too many results or none, I will refine my search query using more specific combinations of keywords, authors (if any can be inferred), or even by searching for papers that cite or are cited by the mentioned references (e.g., the LLaMA paper [6]). The specific compression ratios and dataset names are strong discriminators.
*   **Extracting structured data (tables, equations, references)**: I will rely on the `read_paper` tool's ability to provide the full text. I will then use string matching, regular expressions, or section navigation (if `get_sections` is effective) to precisely locate and extract the required data. For tables, I will parse the text to reconstruct the table structure. For references, I will look for the "References" or "Bibliography" section.
*   **Ensuring conciseness and relevance**: I will strictly adhere to the information requested (facts, equations, definitions, datasets, references) and avoid extraneous details. The synopsis will be a direct presentation of the extracted content.
*   **Avoiding hallucination**: Every piece of information in the synopsis will be directly quoted or accurately summarized from the retrieved document, with no inferred or fabricated content.

### 4. Strategic Use of Available Tools

1.  **`search_papers(query: str)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: To find the specific research paper from which the prefix is taken.
    *   **Execution**: I will start with a precise query: `"LLaMA-7B compression arithmetic coding text8 Project Gutenberg"`. If this is too narrow, I will broaden it to `"LLaMA-7B compression text8"` or `"LLaMA-7B entropy estimation"`. I will look for papers published around 2023, given the mention of a "May 25, 2023" book.
2.  **`download_paper(paper_id: str)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: To obtain the full content of the identified paper.
    *   **Execution**: Once `search_papers` returns a likely candidate (or candidates), I will use the `paper_id` to download the full text.
3.  **`read_paper(paper_id: str)`**:
    *   **Purpose**: To access and parse the entire content of the downloaded paper to extract the required information.
    *   **Execution**: After downloading, I will use `read_paper` to get the raw text. I will then programmatically search this text for:
        *   "TABLE III" and extract the remaining rows.
        *   "TABLE IV" and extract its full content.
        *   "Equation (6)" or "(6)" to find its definition.
        *   The "References" section to extract entries for [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12].
        *   Text immediately following "Table IV shows the compression performance..." for further discussion.
4.  **`get_sections(paper_id: str)` (Contingency)**:
    *   **Purpose**: If direct text search within `read_paper` proves difficult for navigation, this tool could help identify the "Results", "References", or "Conclusion" sections to narrow down the search area.
    *   **Execution**: I would use this to get a list of section titles and then focus my `read_paper` parsing on the relevant sections.

### 5. Expected Outcome

The expected outcome is a concise, plain-text synopsis that accurately presents the following information, directly extracted from the full document:

*   The complete "TABLE III" (mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios).
*   The complete "TABLE IV" (compression performance of LLM on the Project Gutenberg book).
*   The definition or content of "Equation (6)".
*   The full bibliographic details for references [1] (Cover and King), [2] (neural network estimates), [3] (Shannon), [5] (ZPAQ), [6] (LLaMA-7B), [7] (Project Gutenberg book), [11] (SentencePiece), and [12] (paq8h).
*   Any immediate follow-up discussion or conclusions presented directly after Table IV in the document.

This outcome will directly fulfill the task requirements by providing likely future content, maximizing relevance, and adhering to the constraint of not hallucinating.

READY: I am ready to execute the task.

│  1. Analyze the document prefix: I will carefully read the provided         │
│  document prefix to understand its core content, including the              │
│  experimental setup, results presented in tables, and initial discussions.  │
│  I will pay close attention to any explicit mentions of future sections,    │
│  unelaborated concepts, or cited references.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Extract key facts from the prefix using `extract_key_facts`: I will     │
│  use the `extract_key_facts` tool on the entire document prefix. This will  │
│  help me systematically identify the main findings, methodologies,          │
│  datasets, and references already discussed. This structured extraction     │

│  3. Infer likely future content: Based on the extracted key facts and my    │
│  understanding of typical research paper structure (especially following a  │
│  "RESULTS" section), I will infer the types of information likely to        │
│  appear later in the document. This will include:                           │
│      *   **Further Discussion and Interpretation:** Elaboration on the      │
│  significance of the compression ratios, the impact of LLM memory, and the  │
│  comparison with baseline algorithms (ZPAQ, paq8h, zlib). This would        │
│  likely be in a dedicated "Discussion" section.                             │
│      *   **Limitations:** A more formal discussion of the limitations       │
│  already hinted at, such as the potential optimism of text8 results due to  │
│  LLaMA-7B's training corpus, and the comparison across different input      │

│  implications for text compression and language models.                     │
│      *   **Future Work:** Potential directions for further research,        │
│  building on the current study's findings and limitations.                  │
│      *   **Equation Details:** The full form or derivation of "equation     │
│  (6)" for the upper bound on entropy, which is referenced but not fully     │
│  presented in the prefix.                                                   │
│      *   **Definitions:** Potentially more formal definitions of key terms  │
│  or metrics used in the compression analysis.                               │
│      *   **References:** A comprehensive "References" section listing the   │
│  full bibliographic details for all cited works ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6],   │
│  [7], [11], [12]).                                                          │

│  4. Synthesize a concise textual synopsis: I will combine the inferred      │
│  future content into a concise textual synopsis. This synopsis will focus   │
│  on facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references that are        │
│  highly relevant to the document's current content. I will ensure that the  │

## IV. RESULTS

We used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary of size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction with the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase letters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet is restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between these models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM. Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of LLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ algorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the paq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ or paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.

The performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average performance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the state-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the LLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I also shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by Shannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].

The dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M) is shown in Table II. As expected, the compression performance improves with increasing M. We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly with the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a memory of 31 tokens.

It is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and compression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA-7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds to estimates obtained from different input sizes.

It appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset is derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.

Therefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project Gutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8 dataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset. Table IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the entropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of LLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression ratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).

To provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors, we also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the last column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm may not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the LLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.

Output: A concise synopsis (plain text).

Reasoning Plan:
1. Analyze the document prefix: I will carefully read the provided document prefix to understand its core content, including the experimental setup, results presented in tables, and initial discussions. I will pay close attention to any explicit mentions of future sections, unelaborated concepts, or cited references.

2. Extract key facts from the prefix using `extract_key_facts`: I will use the `extract_key_facts` tool on the entire document prefix. This will help me systematically identify the main findings, methodologies, datasets, and references already discussed. This structured extraction will serve as the foundation for inferring what information is logically expected to follow.

3. Infer likely future content: Based on the extracted key facts and my understanding of typical research paper structure (especially following a "RESULTS" section), I will infer the types of information likely to appear later in the document. This will include:
    *   **Further Discussion and Interpretation:** Elaboration on the significance of the compression ratios, the impact of LLM memory, and the comparison with baseline algorithms (ZPAQ, paq8h, zlib). This would likely be in a dedicated "Discussion" section.
    *   **Limitations:** A more formal discussion of the limitations already hinted at, such as the potential optimism of text8 results due to LLaMA-7B's training corpus, and the comparison across different input sizes.
    *   **Conclusion:** A summary of the main findings and their broader implications for text compression and language models.
    *   **Future Work:** Potential directions for further research, building on the current study's findings and limitations.
    *   **Equation Details:** The full form or derivation of "equation (6)" for the upper bound on entropy, which is referenced but not fully presented in the prefix.
    *   **Definitions:** Potentially more formal definitions of key terms or metrics used in the compression analysis.
    *   **References:** A comprehensive "References" section listing the full bibliographic details for all cited works ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12]).

4. Synthesize a concise textual synopsis: I will combine the inferred future content into a concise textual synopsis. This synopsis will focus on facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references that are highly relevant to the document's current content. I will ensure that the synopsis avoids hallucination and only includes content logically supported by the provided prefix and the general structure of scientific papers.

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The user wants a concise textual synopsis of the likely future content of the document, based on the provided prefix. This synopsis should include facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references, and should only include content supported by tools or logical inference from the prefix.
The document prefix is a "RESULTS" section. It discusses:
- Experimental setup (LLaMA-7B, SentencePiece tokenizer, text8 dataset, Project Gutenberg book).
- Comparison with baselines (ZPAQ, paq8h, zlib).
- Performance metrics (compression ratio, entropy upper bound).
- Tables I, II, III presenting results.
- Mentions of equation (6) for the upper bound on entropy, but the equation itself is not provided.
- Several references are cited by number: [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12].
Based on the structure of a typical research paper, after a "RESULTS" section, the following sections are highly likely:
1.  **Discussion/Analysis:** A section to interpret the results, explain their significance, compare the different methods in detail, and elaborate on the implications of the findings.
2.  **Limitations:** A section to formally address the limitations already hinted at in the prefix (e.g., text8 dataset bias, comparison across different input sizes, variance).
3.  **Conclusion:** A summary of the main findings and contributions of the paper.
4.  **Future Work:** Potential directions for further research.
5.  **References:** A complete list of all cited works.
6.  **Appendices (optional):** Could contain derivations of equations (like equation 6), additional experimental details, or supplementary data.
My primary goal is to retrieve *information* that is likely to appear. The most concrete missing pieces of information are:
- The full text of equation (6).
- The full bibliographic details for references [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12].
I will attempt to find the paper using `search_papers` to get the full references and potentially the equation. The paper seems to be very recent (cites a book from May 25, 2023).

However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate\ntransition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of\nlatent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also\nconstrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose\nDiscrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete\nrepresentation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix\nLearning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis,\nestablishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the\nconvergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space\ncomplexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior\nstudies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)\nof 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover,\nthe proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10\ndataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific\ngeneration approaches.",

We compare traditional text compression systems with\nneural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based\nsystems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are\nhighly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system\nusing Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with\nhuge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip -\na novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online\nmemorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely.\nFineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5\ndays, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip\noutperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin,\nimproving compression ratios by approximately 50\\%. With this work, we take the\nfirst step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While\nFineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a\nviable solution for large-scale text compression.

Incidentally, in recent years, the machine\nlearning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful\nself-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit\nimpressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong\ncompressors.

      "abstract": "We consider coverless steganography where a Large Language Model (LLM) drives\nan arithmetic coding decoder to generate stego-texts. An efficient method\nshould embed secret message bits in as few language tokens as possible, while\nstill keeping the stego-text natural and fluent. We show that on the individual\ntoken level, this problem is mathematically equivalent to maximizing the\nentropy of a replacement probability distribution of the next token generation,\nsubject to a constraint on the KL divergence between the chosen probability\ndistribution and the original distribution given by the LLM. A closed-form\nsolution is provided for the optimization problem, which can be computed\nefficiently. Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) An\noften-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt\nselection approach, 2) The combination of the optimized distribution and the\nvocabulary truncation technique is considered, and 3) The combination of the\noptimized distribution with other sequence-level selection heuristics to\nfurther enhance the efficiency and reliability is studied.",

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: The search results show several relevant papers, but none immediately jump out as the exact paper from which the prefix was taken. The paper "Language Modeling Is Compression" (2309.10668v2) by Delétang et al. is highly relevant, as is "FineZip" (2409.17141v1). However, the prefix mentions a book released on May 25, 2023, and the search results are mostly from 2024 and 2025, with one from Sept 2023. The paper I'm looking for would likely be from mid-2023 or later.
The prefix mentions specific references [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12]. I need to find the full details of these references. I can try to search for the paper by looking for the authors mentioned in the prefix, or by searching for specific phrases from the abstract if I can find it.
Let's try to find the paper by searching for a unique phrase from the text, combined with the LLaMA-7B model.
A very specific phrase is: "LLaMA-7B with Arithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character."
Also, the mention of "Project Gutenberg" and a book released on "May 25, 2023" is quite specific.
Let's try a more targeted search using a very specific phrase and the date.Action: search[00m

The document is likely to continue with the full content of **Table IV**, detailing compression performance on the Project Gutenberg book. This will be followed by a **Discussion section** providing in-depth analysis and interpretation of all results, including the superior performance of LLaMA-7B based compression, the impact of LLM memory, the comparison between text8 and Project Gutenberg datasets, and the relation of the entropy upper bound to prior work. The document will also present the full mathematical expression for **equation (6)**, which defines the upper bound on entropy. A dedicated **Limitations section** will formally address issues such as dataset bias, comparison across different input sizes, and the variance of results. Finally, a **Conclusion section** will summarize the key findings, and a **Future Work section** will outline directions for further research. A comprehensive **References section** will provide full bibliographic details for all cited works, including [1] Cover and King, [2] recent neural network entropy estimates, [3] Shannon, [5] ZPAQ algorithm, [6] LLaMA-7B, [7] the Project Gutenberg book (May 25, 2023), [11] SentencePiece tokenizer, and [12] paq8h algorithm.[00m
