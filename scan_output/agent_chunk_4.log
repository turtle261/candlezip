## Abstract

We provide new estimates of an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy of English using the large language model LLaMA-7B as a predictor for the next token given a window of past tokens. This estimate is significantly smaller than currently available estimates in [1], [2]. A natural byproduct is an algorithm for lossless compression of English text which combines the prediction from the large language model with a lossless compression scheme. Preliminary results from limited experiments suggest that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art text compression schemes such as BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.

## I. INTRODUCTION

There are close connections between learning, prediction, and compression. The success of ChatGPT has captured the fascination of general public and brought the connection between learning and prediction to the fore. The main advance brought about by large language models such as LLaMA and GPT-4 is that they excel at predicting the next word (token) in a paragraph based on knowing the past several words (tokens).

The connection between prediction and compression was explored as early as 1951 by Shannon in order to estimate the entropy of the English language [3]. The idea that a good predictor for the ith value in a time series based on the past values can be effectively converted to a good compression algorithm has played a prominent role in information theory. Many algorithms for speech, image, and video compression exploit this idea either explicitly or implicitly. Within the context of lossless compression of English text, the idea of combining a language model with arithmetic coding has emerged as a very effective paradigm [4]. The performance of such a compression scheme depends substantially on the efficacy of the predictor and every time there is a major advance in the prediction capability, it behooves us to study its effect on the compression performance. Indeed, in 2018, the authors of [5] used recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the predictor and reported improved results for certain kinds of sources. Their scheme still did not outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as BSC and ZPAQ for text compression.

It is therefore natural at this time to study whether we can obtain better compression results and sharper estimates of the entropy of the English language using recent large language models such as LLaMA-7B [6]. This is the main goal of this paper. We show that when the LLaMA-7B large language model is used as the predictor, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is 0.709 bits/character when estimated using a 1MB section of the text8 dataset. This is smaller than earlier estimates provided in [1] and [2, Table 4]. The estimate of the upper bound increases to 0.85 bits/character for a 100 KB section of the text from [7], which is still lower than the estimates in [2]. When LLaMA-7B is combined with an Arithmetic coder for compression, we obtain a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character on a 1MB section of the text8 dataset and a compression ratio of 0.8426 bits/character on a 100KB section of a text from [7], which are significantly better than the compression ratio obtained using BSC, ZPAQ and pq8h on the full 100MB of the text8 dataset.

## II. INTUITIVE EXPLANATION OF THE MAIN IDEA

We will use the following example to describe the main idea, which is nearly identical to that proposed by Shannon in [3] for estimating the entropy of English. The main difference is in the use of tokens which represent groups of letters of variable length and in the use of a large language model instead of a human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence that reads as

My first attempt at writing a book

Our goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can be reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)

′My′, ′first′, ′attempt′, ′at′, ′writing′, ′a′, ′book′

A language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the past M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in Figure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be words such as ′reading′,′ writing′,′ driving′,′ cooking′ etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in our sentence (′writing′) in this list and call it R5. We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank 0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for ′writing′ is R5 = 1.

**Fig. 1.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| reading  | 0.3        |
| writing  | 0.2        |
| cycling  | 0.1        |
| driving  | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R5 = 1

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M

Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nIf the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the\nrank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the\nrank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be\n\n\n1, 0, 0, . . .\n\n\nA sequence with many \u20180\u2019s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the\nranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the\nranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\nSequence of ranks\n\n|e of ranks|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|. ., rNT|Compression (zip)|Nb|\n||||\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.\n\n\nWhen we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language\nmodel one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at\nrank R i during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the\nsame LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.\n\nThe idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the\nprobabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.\n\n\n3\n\n\nIII. C OMPRESSION USING LLM S\n\n\nLet s denote a sentence from the English language composed of N c letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the\nalphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of N T tokens\ndenoted by x = x 1, x 2, . . ., x i\u22121, x i, x i+1, . . . x N T, where x i \u2208X . There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence,\ncompressing s is the same as compressing x. x i \u2019s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the\nupper case letter X i .\nA language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens x i\u2212M, x i\u2212M+1, . . ., x i\u22121\nand produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by\nq i (x i ) := Pr(X i = x i |x i\u22121, x i\u22122, . . ., x i\u2212M ), \u2200x i \u2208X . The PMF vector q i := [q i (1), q i (2), . . ., q i (D)] [T] is sorted in\ndescending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by \u02dcq i . Let \u03b3 i : X \u2192X be a permutation on the integers\nfrom 1 to D such that\n\n\u02dc\nq i (\u03b3 i (j)) = q i (j), \u2200j \u2208X .\n\n\nThat is, \u03b3 i (j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the\ntoken x i at epoch i, r i := \u03b3 i (x i ). The sequence {r i } [N] i=1 [T] [is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to]\nproduce N b bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general,\nthe lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors q i \u2019s in addition to the sequence of ranks.\nThe main metric of interest is the compression ratio \u03c1 defined as\n\n\u03c1 := [N] [b] bits/character.\n\nN c\n\n\n\nLosseless\n\nCompression\n\n\n\nTokens . . ., x i\u2212M, . . ., x i\u22121\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n\nInput sentence s with N c characters\n\n\n\ni i i\u22121 Rank\n\nLLM\ncomputation\n\n\n\nq i = Pr(X i = j|x [i] i [\u2212] \u2212 [M] 1 [)] Rank r i Losseless N b bits\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.\n\n\nA. Entropy bounds\n\n\nLet S \u2208S [\u221e] be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by S n,\nwhereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as S n . The tokenizer parses the input\nstring and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X 1, X 2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, X i is the ith\ntoken. The number of characters employed to generate X i depends on the realization of the random process and, as such,\nwe introduce random variable B i to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical\nconsiderations, we only admit tokenizers for which B i \u2265 1 and B i is uniformly bounded, with B i < B < \u221e; these are\ncharacteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens\ngrows unbounded N T \u2192\u221e, the number of characters must also approach infinity N c \u2192\u221e. Formally, consider the tokenizer\nfunction T : S [N] \u2192X [N] operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S [\u221e] . For\nnatural number, i \u2208 N, define m i : S [N] \u2192 N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an\ninput sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then\n\n\nm i (s) = min n [{][length (][T][ (][s] [n] [))][ \u2265] [i][}][ .] (1)\n\n\nWe note that, by construction, lim n\u2192\u221e length (T (s n )) = \u221e and, as such, m i (\u00b7) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress\nthat the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map\nto the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially\nmay be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances\nwhere T (s n ) = T (s n+1 ). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the\nrestricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted\nset for which T (y n ) = x i is s m i (s) . Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token\n\nas\nb i = m i (s) \u2212 m i\u22121 (s)\n\n\n4\n\n\nwith initial condition m \u22121 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first N T tokens for a random input\nbecomes N c = [\ufffd] i [N] =1 [T] [B] [i] [.]\nHaving established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {S k } [\u221e] k=1 [,]\n{B i } [\u221e] i=1 [, and][ {][X] [i] [}] [\u221e] i=1 [are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that]\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\nn [log] [2] [ p] [S] [n] [(][S] [1] [, . . ., S] [n] [) =][ \u2212] n [1]\n\n\n\nn [log] [2] [ p] [S] [n] [(][S] [n] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][S][)] almost surely. (2)\n\n\n\nLet \u2126 S be the collection of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem\nimplies\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [1] [, . . ., X] [i] [) =][ \u2212] [1] i\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [i] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][X][)] almost surely.

(4)\ni\u2192\u221e i\n\n\nSet \u2126 B to be the set of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. For any \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 S \u2229 \u2126 X \u2229 \u2126 B, we deduce that\n\n\nH(S) = lim\nk\u2192\u221e [\u2212] k [1] [log] [2] [ p] [S] [k] [(][S] [k] [(][\u03c9][))]\n\n= lim i\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i log 2 p S li (S l i (\u03c9))\n\n\n= lim log 2 Pr (X i = T (S l i (\u03c9)))\ni\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i\n\n\n\n1\n\ni [log] [2] [ Pr (][X] [i] [ =][ x] [i] [) =][ H] E [(] B [X][)]\n\n\n\n1 1\n\n= \u2212\nE[B] i [lim] \u2192\u221e i\n\n\n\nE[B] [.]\n\n\n\nThe first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {l i = m i (S(\u03c9))|i \u2208 N} is an infinite\nsubset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately\ngather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following\n\ntwo events,\n{\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|X i (\u03c9) = x i } = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|T (S m i (S(\u03c9)) ) = x i }.\n\n\nThis is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step\nholds because we are considering an \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 B . The sets \u2126 S, \u2126 X, and \u2126 B each have probability one; this implies that their\nintersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that\n\nH(S) = [H][(][X][)] almost surely.\n\nE[B]\n\n\nAs a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to\nexploit.\nThen, from the results of [1], we can see that\n\n\n\nPr\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nH(X) \u2264 lim\nN T \u2192\u221e [\u2212] N [1] T\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd log 2 q i (X i )\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n= 1, (5)\n\n\n\nwhere q i (\u00b7) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is\ngiven by\n\n\n\n\n[1] N T\n\nN T \ufffd i=1 [log] 2 [q] [i] [(][X] [i] [)]\n\n\n\nH(S) \u2264 lim N T \u2192\u221e \u2212 N [1]\n\n\n\n. (6)\nE[B]\n\n\n\nWe refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by H ub . The\nnumerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens X N T and the denominator in (6) is\nthe average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3\nbits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and\ndiscussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance\nof several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc\nis the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.\n\n\nB. Encoding schemes\n\n\nWe consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.\n\n\n5\n\n\n1) Compressing the ranks using zlib: The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks.\nWe refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib .\n2) Token-by-Token Compression: The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a\ntime-varying codebook to encode the token x i at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming q i to be the true distribution of\nthe tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where\n1\nthe codeword for the token x i is of length l i = \u2308log 2 q i (x i ) [\u2309][. A prefix-free code with this length for][ x] [i] [ is guaranteed to exist]\nsince this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT,\nis given by\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n1\nlog 2\n\ufffd q i (x i )\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT =\n\n\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] .\n\n\n\n3) Arithmetic Coding: The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to\ncombine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding\nis well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use q i (x i ) as the probability of token x i at time in the arithmetic\ncoding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as \u03c1 LLM+AC . It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly\noptimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLM+AC \u2248\n\n\n\nN T 1\n\ufffd i=1 log 2 q i (x i )\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] . (7)\n\n\n\nClearly, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and \u03c1 LLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). H ub, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and\n\u03c1 LLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind\nwhen interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.\n\n\nIV. R ESULTS\n\n\nWe used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary\nof size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction\nwith the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase\nletters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet\nis restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between\nthese models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM.\n[Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip)\nLLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ\nalgorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the\npaq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to\nbe best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ\nor paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.\nThe performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average\nperformance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with\nArithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the\nstate-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the\nLLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I\nalso shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by\nShannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].\nThe dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M ) is shown in Table II. As expected, the\ncompression performance improves with increasing M . We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly\nwith the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a\nmemory of 31 tokens.\nIt is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and\nhence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and\ncompression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds\nto estimates obtained from different input sizes.\nIt appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset\nis derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.\n\n\n6\n\n\nTherefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project\nGutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8\ndataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset.\nTable IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the\nentropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper\nbound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of\nLLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression\nratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).\nTo provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors,\nwe also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the\nlast column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm\nmay not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the\nLLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.\n\n\nV.

**Section III: Compression Using LLMs**
This section formally defines the compression problem. It introduces the concept of parsing a sentence into a sequence of tokens and how a language model with memory M produces a probability mass function (PMF) for the next token. It defines the rank of a token and the compression ratio (ρ).

*   **A. Entropy bounds:** This subsection delves into the theoretical underpinnings, relating the entropy of the character sequence H(S) to the entropy of the token sequence H(X) and the average number of characters per token E[B]. It presents Equation (2) and (3) based on the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem for character and token sequences, respectively. Equation (4) defines the relationship between the number of characters and tokens. The key result is H(S) = H(X)/E[B]. It then uses results from [1] to establish an asymptotic upper bound on H(X) (Equation 5) and consequently on H(S) (Equation 6), denoted as H_ub. It discusses previous entropy estimates by Shannon [3], Cover and King [1], and more recent neural network-based estimates [2].
*   **B. Encoding schemes:** This subsection describes three specific compression schemes:
    1.  **Compressing the ranks using zlib:** This scheme, referred to as LLaMA+zlib, uses the zlib algorithm to compress the sequence of ranks.
    2.  **Token-by-Token Compression:** This scheme, LLaMA+TbyT, uses a time-varying prefix-free code (like Huffman code, or a simplified version with codeword length l_i = ⌈log₂ (1/q_i(x_i))⌉) to encode tokens based on their predicted probabilities. Equation (7) provides its compression ratio.
    3.  **Arithmetic Coding:** This scheme, LLM+AC, combines the LLM's output probabilities with arithmetic coding, known for its near-optimal compression performance [10]. Its compression ratio is approximated by Equation (7).

**Section IV: Results**
This section presents the experimental setup and findings.
*   **LLM and Tokenizer:** LLaMA-7B [6] is used as the language model, and SentencePiece tokenizer [11] (dictionary size 32000) is employed. The authors note the difference in input alphabet (uppercase, special characters) compared to earlier studies (lowercase only), making direct comparisons challenging.
*   **Datasets and Baselines:** The primary dataset is text8 (1MB section, derived from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip). Baselines include ZPAQ [5] (1.4 bpc) and paq8h [12] (1.2 bpc) for the full 100MB text8 dataset.
*   **Performance on text8:** Table I details results for 10 batches of 100,000 tokens from text8.
    *   LLaMA+AC achieves an average compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character, significantly outperforming ZPAQ and paq8h.
    *   H_ub is estimated at 0.7093 bpc, which is lower than previous estimates [1], [2], [3].
    *   LLaMA+zlib and LLaMA+TbyT also show better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.
*   **Effect of LLM Memory (M):** Table II shows that compression performance improves with increasing memory M (e.g., from M=31 to M=511). Inference time scales linearly with memory length.
*   **Statistical Variance:** Table III provides the mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios over 10 batches, highlighting the variance. The authors acknowledge that comparing LLaMA-7B on 1MB with baselines on 100MB is a limitation.
*   **Performance on a New Dataset:** To address potential optimism due to text8's Wikipedia origin (which LLaMA-7B might have been trained on), the model is tested on a recently released book from Project Gutenberg [7] (May 25, 2023), using a 100,000-token section.
    *   Table IV shows slightly higher compression ratios and entropy bounds for this dataset compared to text8, but still lower than existing models [2].
    *   LLaMA+AC achieves 0.8426 bpc, close to the estimated upper bound.
    *   A standalone zlib run on this text yielded 2.8 bpc, demonstrating the substantial improvement from LLM-based compression.

## Abstract

We provide new estimates of an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy of English using the large language model LLaMA-7B as a predictor for the next token given a window of past tokens. This estimate is significantly smaller than currently available estimates in [1], [2]. A natural byproduct is an algorithm for lossless compression of English text which combines the prediction from the large language model with a lossless compression scheme. Preliminary results from limited experiments suggest that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art text compression schemes such as BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.

## I. INTRODUCTION

There are close connections between learning, prediction, and compression. The success of ChatGPT has captured the fascination of general public and brought the connection between learning and prediction to the fore. The main advance brought about by large language models such as LLaMA and GPT-4 is that they excel at predicting the next word (token) in a paragraph based on knowing the past several words (tokens).

The connection between prediction and compression was explored as early as 1951 by Shannon in order to estimate the entropy of the English language [3]. The idea that a good predictor for the ith value in a time series based on the past values can be effectively converted to a good compression algorithm has played a prominent role in information theory. Many algorithms for speech, image, and video compression exploit this idea either explicitly or implicitly. Within the context of lossless compression of English text, the idea of combining a language model with arithmetic coding has emerged as a very effective paradigm [4]. The performance of such a compression scheme depends substantially on the efficacy of the predictor and every time there is a major advance in the prediction capability, it behooves us to study its effect on the compression performance. Indeed, in 2018, the authors of [5] used recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the predictor and reported improved results for certain kinds of sources. Their scheme still did not outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as BSC and ZPAQ for text compression.

It is therefore natural at this time to study whether we can obtain better compression results and sharper estimates of the entropy of the English language using recent large language models such as LLaMA-7B [6]. This is the main goal of this paper. We show that when the LLaMA-7B large language model is used as the predictor, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is 0.709 bits/character when estimated using a 1MB section of the text8 dataset. This is smaller than earlier estimates provided in [1] and [2, Table 4]. The estimate of the upper bound increases to 0.85 bits/character for a 100 KB section of the text from [7], which is still lower than the estimates in [2]. When LLaMA-7B is combined with an Arithmetic coder for compression, we obtain a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character on a 1MB section of the text8 dataset and a compression ratio of 0.8426 bits/character on a 100KB section of a text from [7], which are significantly better than the compression ratio obtained using BSC, ZPAQ and pq8h on the full 100MB of the text8 dataset.

## II. INTUITIVE EXPLANATION OF THE MAIN IDEA

We will use the following example to describe the main idea, which is nearly identical to that proposed by Shannon in [3] for estimating the entropy of English. The main difference is in the use of tokens which represent groups of letters of variable length and in the use of a large language model instead of a human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence that reads as

My first attempt at writing a book

Our goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can be reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)

′My′, ′first′, ′attempt′, ′at′, ′writing′, ′a′, ′book′

A language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the past M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in Figure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be words such as ′reading′,′ writing′,′ driving′,′ cooking′ etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in our sentence (′writing′) in this list and call it R5. We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank 0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for ′writing′ is R5 = 1.

**Fig. 1.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| reading  | 0.3        |
| writing  | 0.2        |
| cycling  | 0.1        |
| driving  | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R5 = 1

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M

Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nIf the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the\nrank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the\nrank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be\n\n\n1, 0, 0, . . .\n\n\nA sequence with many \u20180\u2019s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the\nranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the\nranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\nSequence of ranks\n\n|e of ranks|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|. ., rNT|Compression (zip)|Nb|\n||||\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.\n\n\nWhen we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language\nmodel one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at\nrank R i during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the\nsame LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.\n\nThe idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the\nprobabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.\n\n\n3\n\n\nIII. C OMPRESSION USING LLM S\n\n\nLet s denote a sentence from the English language composed of N c letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the\nalphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of N T tokens\ndenoted by x = x 1, x 2, . . ., x i\u22121, x i, x i+1, . . . x N T, where x i \u2208X . There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence,\ncompressing s is the same as compressing x. x i \u2019s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the\nupper case letter X i .\nA language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens x i\u2212M, x i\u2212M+1, . . ., x i\u22121\nand produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by\nq i (x i ) := Pr(X i = x i |x i\u22121, x i\u22122, . . ., x i\u2212M ), \u2200x i \u2208X . The PMF vector q i := [q i (1), q i (2), . . ., q i (D)] [T] is sorted in\ndescending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by \u02dcq i . Let \u03b3 i : X \u2192X be a permutation on the integers\nfrom 1 to D such that\n\n\u02dc\nq i (\u03b3 i (j)) = q i (j), \u2200j \u2208X .\n\n\nThat is, \u03b3 i (j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the\ntoken x i at epoch i, r i := \u03b3 i (x i ). The sequence {r i } [N] i=1 [T] [is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to]\nproduce N b bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general,\nthe lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors q i \u2019s in addition to the sequence of ranks.\nThe main metric of interest is the compression ratio \u03c1 defined as\n\n\u03c1 := [N] [b] bits/character.\n\nN c\n\n\n\nLosseless\n\nCompression\n\n\n\nTokens . . ., x i\u2212M, . . ., x i\u22121\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n\nInput sentence s with N c characters\n\n\n\ni i i\u22121 Rank\n\nLLM\ncomputation\n\n\n\nq i = Pr(X i = j|x [i] i [\u2212] \u2212 [M] 1 [)] Rank r i Losseless N b bits\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.\n\n\nA. Entropy bounds\n\n\nLet S \u2208S [\u221e] be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by S n,\nwhereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as S n . The tokenizer parses the input\nstring and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X 1, X 2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, X i is the ith\ntoken. The number of characters employed to generate X i depends on the realization of the random process and, as such,\nwe introduce random variable B i to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical\nconsiderations, we only admit tokenizers for which B i \u2265 1 and B i is uniformly bounded, with B i < B < \u221e; these are\ncharacteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens\ngrows unbounded N T \u2192\u221e, the number of characters must also approach infinity N c \u2192\u221e. Formally, consider the tokenizer\nfunction T : S [N] \u2192X [N] operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S [\u221e] . For\nnatural number, i \u2208 N, define m i : S [N] \u2192 N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an\ninput sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then\n\n\nm i (s) = min n [{][length (][T][ (][s] [n] [))][ \u2265] [i][}][ .] (1)\n\n\nWe note that, by construction, lim n\u2192\u221e length (T (s n )) = \u221e and, as such, m i (\u00b7) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress\nthat the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map\nto the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially\nmay be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances\nwhere T (s n ) = T (s n+1 ). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the\nrestricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted\nset for which T (y n ) = x i is s m i (s) . Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token\n\nas\nb i = m i (s) \u2212 m i\u22121 (s)\n\n\n4\n\n\nwith initial condition m \u22121 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first N T tokens for a random input\nbecomes N c = [\ufffd] i [N] =1 [T] [B] [i] [.]\nHaving established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {S k } [\u221e] k=1 [,]\n{B i } [\u221e] i=1 [, and][ {][X] [i] [}] [\u221e] i=1 [are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that]\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\nn [log] [2] [ p] [S] [n] [(][S] [1] [, . . ., S] [n] [) =][ \u2212] n [1]\n\n\n\nn [log] [2] [ p] [S] [n] [(][S] [n] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][S][)] almost surely. (2)\n\n\n\nLet \u2126 S be the collection of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem\nimplies\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [1] [, . . ., X] [i] [) =][ \u2212] [1] i\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [i] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][X][)] almost surely.

(4)\ni\u2192\u221e i\n\n\nSet \u2126 B to be the set of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. For any \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 S \u2229 \u2126 X \u2229 \u2126 B, we deduce that\n\n\nH(S) = lim\nk\u2192\u221e [\u2212] k [1] [log] [2] [ p] [S] [k] [(][S] [k] [(][\u03c9][))]\n\n= lim i\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i log 2 p S li (S l i (\u03c9))\n\n\n= lim log 2 Pr (X i = T (S l i (\u03c9)))\ni\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i\n\n\n\n1\n\ni [log] [2] [ Pr (][X] [i] [ =][ x] [i] [) =][ H] E [(] B [X][)]\n\n\n\n1 1\n\n= \u2212\nE[B] i [lim] \u2192\u221e i\n\n\n\nE[B] [.]\n\n\n\nThe first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {l i = m i (S(\u03c9))|i \u2208 N} is an infinite\nsubset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately\ngather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following\n\ntwo events,\n{\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|X i (\u03c9) = x i } = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|T (S m i (S(\u03c9)) ) = x i }.\n\n\nThis is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step\nholds because we are considering an \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 B . The sets \u2126 S, \u2126 X, and \u2126 B each have probability one; this implies that their\nintersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that\n\nH(S) = [H][(][X][)] almost surely.\n\nE[B]\n\n\nAs a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to\nexploit.\nThen, from the results of [1], we can see that\n\n\n\nPr\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nH(X) \u2264 lim\nN T \u2192\u221e [\u2212] N [1] T\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd log 2 q i (X i )\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n= 1, (5)\n\n\n\nwhere q i (\u00b7) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is\ngiven by\n\n\n\n\n[1] N T\n\nN T \ufffd i=1 [log] 2 [q] [i] [(][X] [i] [)]\n\n\n\nH(S) \u2264 lim N T \u2192\u221e \u2212 N [1]\n\n\n\n. (6)\nE[B]\n\n\n\nWe refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by H ub . The\nnumerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens X N T and the denominator in (6) is\nthe average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3\nbits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and\ndiscussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance\nof several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc\nis the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.\n\n\nB. Encoding schemes\n\n\nWe consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.\n\n\n5\n\n\n1) Compressing the ranks using zlib: The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks.\nWe refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib .\n2) Token-by-Token Compression: The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a\ntime-varying codebook to encode the token x i at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming q i to be the true distribution of\nthe tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where\n1\nthe codeword for the token x i is of length l i = \u2308log 2 q i (x i ) [\u2309][. A prefix-free code with this length for][ x] [i] [ is guaranteed to exist]\nsince this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT,\nis given by\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n1\nlog 2\n\ufffd q i (x i )\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT =\n\n\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] .\n\n\n\n3) Arithmetic Coding: The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to\ncombine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding\nis well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use q i (x i ) as the probability of token x i at time in the arithmetic\ncoding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as \u03c1 LLM+AC . It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly\noptimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLM+AC \u2248\n\n\n\nN T 1\n\ufffd i=1 log 2 q i (x i )\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] . (7)\n\n\n\nClearly, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and \u03c1 LLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). H ub, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and\n\u03c1 LLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind\nwhen interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.\n\n\nIV. R ESULTS\n\n\nWe used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary\nof size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction\nwith the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase\nletters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet\nis restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between\nthese models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM.\n[Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip)\nLLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ\nalgorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the\npaq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to\nbe best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ\nor paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.\nThe performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average\nperformance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with\nArithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the\nstate-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the\nLLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I\nalso shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by\nShannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].\nThe dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M ) is shown in Table II. As expected, the\ncompression performance improves with increasing M . We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly\nwith the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a\nmemory of 31 tokens.\nIt is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and\nhence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and\ncompression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds\nto estimates obtained from different input sizes.\nIt appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset\nis derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.\n\n\n6\n\n\nTherefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project\nGutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8\ndataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset.\nTable IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the\nentropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper\nbound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of\nLLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression\nratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).\nTo provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors,\nwe also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the\nlast column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm\nmay not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the\nLLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.\n\n\nV.

The document prefix already provided sections I, II, and the beginning of III. I will now read the entire paper to get the full context and then synthesize the synopsis.
Based on the document prefix, the paper is about using LLaMA-7B for lossless text compression and estimating the entropy of English.
The abstract and introduction mention:

- This estimate is significantly smaller than previous estimates ([1], [2]).
- A byproduct is a lossless compression algorithm combining LLaMA-7B prediction with a lossless compression scheme.
- Preliminary results suggest it outperforms BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.
- Specific entropy bounds: 0.709 bits/character (1MB text8) and 0.85 bits/character (100KB text from [7]).
- Specific compression ratios: 0.7101 bits/character (1MB text8) and 0.8426 bits/character (100KB text from [7]).
- The intuitive explanation (Section II) details how LLaMA predicts next tokens and how ranks are compressed. It also mentions that using probabilities with arithmetic coding is better than compressing ranks.
Section III, "Compression Using LLMs", has started and will likely detail:
- The formal definition of the language model and tokenization process.
- Mathematical formulations for entropy bounds.
- Specific encoding schemes (LLaMA+zlib, Token-by-Token Compression, Arithmetic Coding).
Therefore, I expect the following content to appear later in the document:

This estimate is significantly smaller than currently available\nestimates in [1], [2]. A natural byproduct is an algorithm for lossless compression of English text which combines the prediction\nfrom the large language model with a lossless compression scheme. Preliminary results from limited experiments suggest that our\nscheme outperforms state-of-the-art text compression schemes such as BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.\n\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\n\n\nThere are close connections between learning, prediction, and compression. The success of ChatGPT has captured the\nfascination of general public and brought the connection between learning and prediction to the fore. The main advance\nbrought about by large language models such as LLaMA and GPT-4 is that they excel at predicting the next word (token) in\na paragraph based on knowing the past several words (tokens).\nThe connection between prediction and compression was explored as early as 1951 by Shannon in order to estimate the\nentropy of the English language [3]. The idea that a good predictor for the ith value in a time series based on the past\nvalues can be effectively converted to a good compression algorithm has played a prominent role in information theory. Many\nalgorithms for speech, image, and video compression exploit this idea either explicitly or implicitly. Within the context of\nlossless compression of English text, the idea of combining a language model with arithmetic coding has emerged as a very\neffective paradigm [4]. The performance of such a compression scheme depends substantially on the efficacy of the predictor\nand every time there is a major advance in the prediction capability, it behooves us to study its effect on the compression\nperformance. Indeed, in 2018, the authors of [5] used recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the predictor and reported improved\nresults for certain kinds of sources. Their scheme still did not outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as BSC and ZPAQ\nfor text compression.\nIt is therefore natural at this time to study whether we can obtain better compression results and sharper estimates of the\nentropy of the English language using recent large language models such as LLaMA-7B [6]. This is the main goal of this\npaper. We show that when the LLaMA-7B large language model is used as the predictor, the asymptotic upper bound on the\nentropy is 0.709 bits/character when estimated using a 1MB section of the text8 dataset. This is smaller than earlier estimates\nprovided in [1] and [2, Table 4]. The estimate of the upper bound increases to 0.85 bits/character for a 100 KB section of\nthe text from [7], which is still lower than the estimates in [2]. When LLaMA-7B is combined with an Arithmetic coder for\ncompression, we obtain a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character on a 1MB section of the text8 dataset and a compression\nratio of 0.8426 bits/character on a 100KB section of a text from [7], which are significantly better than the compression ratio\nobtained using BSC, ZPAQ and pq8h on the full 100MB of the text8 dataset.\n\n\nII. I NTUITIVE EXPLANATION OF THE MAIN IDEA\n\n\nWe will use the following example to describe the main idea, which is nearly identical to that proposed by Shannon in [3]\nfor estimating the entropy of English. The main difference is in the use of tokens which represent groups of letters of variable\nlength and in the use of a large language model instead of a human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence\nthat reads as\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\nOur goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can\nbe reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)\n\n\n\u2032 My \u2032, \u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032, \u2032 writing \u2032, \u2032 a \u2032, \u2032 book \u2032\n\n\nA language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the\npast M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in\n\n\n2\n\n\nFigure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be\nwords such as [\u2032] reading [\u2032], [\u2032] writing [\u2032], [\u2032] driving [\u2032], [\u2032] cooking [\u2032] etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in\nour sentence ( [\u2032] writing [\u2032] ) in this list and call it R 5 . We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank\n0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for [\u2032] writing [\u2032] is R 5 = 1.\n\n\nTokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032 My \u2032, \u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n|Col1|LLM|q = Pr(x5|x4 1)<br>5|Rank<br>computation|R5 = 1|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||LLM|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>||\n\n\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreading 0.3\nwriting 0.2\ncycling 0.1\ndriving 0.05\n\n... ...\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nThen, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2\nthrough 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same\nword in the sentence that we wish to encode, [\u2032] a [\u2032], and hence, the rank R 6 would be 0.\n\n\nTokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032, \u2032 writing \u2032\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n|Col1|LLM|q = Pr(x6|x5 2)<br>6|Rank<br>computation|R6 = 0|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||LLM|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>||\n\n\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nan 0.2\n\nthe 0.05\n\n... ...\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nIf the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the\nrank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the\nrank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be\n\n\n1, 0, 0, . . .\n\n\nA sequence with many \u20180\u2019s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the\nranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the\nranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\nSequence of ranks\n\n|e of ranks|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|. ., rNT|Compression (zip)|Nb|\n||||\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.\n\n\nWhen we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language\nmodel one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at\nrank R i during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the\nsame LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.\n\nThe idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the\nprobabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.\n\n\n3\n\n\nIII. C OMPRESSION USING LLM S\n\n\nLet s denote a sentence from the English language composed of N c letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the\nalphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of N T tokens\ndenoted by x = x 1, x 2, . . ., x i\u22121, x i, x i+1, . . . x N T, where x i \u2208X . There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence,\ncompressing s is the same as compressing x. x i \u2019s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the\nupper case letter X i .\nA language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens x i\u2212M, x i\u2212M+1, . . ., x i\u22121\nand produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by\nq i (x i ) := Pr(X i = x i |x i\u22121, x i\u22122, . . ., x i\u2212M ), \u2200x i \u2208X . The PMF vector q i := [q i (1), q i (2), . . ., q i (D)] [T] is sorted in\ndescending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by \u02dcq i . Let \u03b3 i : X \u2192X be a permutation on the integers\nfrom 1 to D such that\n\n\u02dc\nq i (\u03b3 i (j)) = q i (j), \u2200j \u2208X .\n\n\nThat is, \u03b3 i (j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the\ntoken x i at epoch i, r i := \u03b3 i (x i ). The sequence {r i } [N] i=1 [T] [is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to]\nproduce N b bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general,\nthe lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors q i \u2019s in addition to the sequence of ranks.\nThe main metric of interest is the compression ratio \u03c1 defined as\n\n\u03c1 := [N] [b] bits/character.\n\nN c\n\n\n\nLosseless\n\nCompression\n\n\n\nTokens . . ., x i\u2212M, . . ., x i\u22121\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n\nInput sentence s with N c characters\n\n\n\ni i i\u22121 Rank\n\nLLM\ncomputation\n\n\n\nq i = Pr(X i = j|x [i] i [\u2212] \u2212 [M] 1 [)] Rank r i Losseless N b bits\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.\n\n\nA. Entropy bounds\n\n\nLet S \u2208S [\u221e] be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by S n,\nwhereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as S n . The tokenizer parses the input\nstring and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X 1, X 2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, X i is the ith\ntoken. The number of characters employed to generate X i depends on the realization of the random process and, as such,\nwe introduce random variable B i to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical\nconsiderations, we only admit tokenizers for which B i \u2265 1 and B i is uniformly bounded, with B i < B < \u221e; these are\ncharacteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens\ngrows unbounded N T \u2192\u221e, the number of characters must also approach infinity N c \u2192\u221e. Formally, consider the tokenizer\nfunction T : S [N] \u2192X [N] operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S [\u221e] . For\nnatural number, i \u2208 N, define m i : S [N] \u2192 N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an\ninput sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then\n\n\nm i (s) = min n [{][length (][T][ (][s] [n] [))][ \u2265] [i][}][ .] (1)\n\n\nWe note that, by construction, lim n\u2192\u221e length (T (s n )) = \u221e and, as such, m i (\u00b7) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress\nthat the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map\nto the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially\nmay be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances\nwhere T (s n ) = T (s n+1 ). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the\nrestricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted\nset for which T (y n ) = x i is s m i (s) . Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token\n\nas\nb i = m i (s) \u2212 m i\u22121 (s)\n\n\n4\n\n\nwith initial condition m \u22121 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first N T tokens for a random input\nbecomes N c = [\ufffd] i [N] =1 [T] [B] [i] [.]\nHaving established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {S k } [\u221e] k=1 [,]\n{B i } [\u221e] i=1 [, and][ {][X] [i] [}] [\u221e] i=1 [are stationary and ergodic processes.

(2)\n\n\n\nLet \u2126 S be the collection of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem\nimplies\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [1] [, . . ., X] [i] [) =][ \u2212] [1] i\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [i] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][X][)] almost surely. (3)\n\n\n\nDefine \u2126 X as the collection of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have\n\n\nm i (S)\nlim = E [B] almost surely. (4)\ni\u2192\u221e i\n\n\nSet \u2126 B to be the set of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. For any \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 S \u2229 \u2126 X \u2229 \u2126 B, we deduce that\n\n\nH(S) = lim\nk\u2192\u221e [\u2212] k [1] [log] [2] [ p] [S] [k] [(][S] [k] [(][\u03c9][))]\n\n= lim i\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i log 2 p S li (S l i (\u03c9))\n\n\n= lim log 2 Pr (X i = T (S l i (\u03c9)))\ni\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i\n\n\n\n1\n\ni [log] [2] [ Pr (][X] [i] [ =][ x] [i] [) =][ H] E [(] B [X][)]\n\n\n\n1 1\n\n= \u2212\nE[B] i [lim] \u2192\u221e i\n\n\n\nE[B] [.]\n\n\n\nThe first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {l i = m i (S(\u03c9))|i \u2208 N} is an infinite\nsubset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately\ngather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following\n\ntwo events,\n{\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|X i (\u03c9) = x i } = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|T (S m i (S(\u03c9)) ) = x i }.\n\n\nThis is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step\nholds because we are considering an \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 B . The sets \u2126 S, \u2126 X, and \u2126 B each have probability one; this implies that their\nintersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that\n\nH(S) = [H][(][X][)] almost surely.\n\nE[B]\n\n\nAs a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to\nexploit.\nThen, from the results of [1], we can see that\n\n\n\nPr\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nH(X) \u2264 lim\nN T \u2192\u221e [\u2212] N [1] T\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd log 2 q i (X i )\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n= 1, (5)\n\n\n\nwhere q i (\u00b7) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is\ngiven by\n\n\n\n\n[1] N T\n\nN T \ufffd i=1 [log] 2 [q] [i] [(][X] [i] [)]\n\n\n\nH(S) \u2264 lim N T \u2192\u221e \u2212 N [1]\n\n\n\n. (6)\nE[B]\n\n\n\nWe refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by H ub . The\nnumerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens X N T and the denominator in (6) is\nthe average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3\nbits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and\ndiscussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance\nof several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc\nis the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.\n\n\nB. Encoding schemes\n\n\nWe consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.\n\n\n5\n\n\n1) Compressing the ranks using zlib: The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks.\nWe refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib .\n2) Token-by-Token Compression: The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a\ntime-varying codebook to encode the token x i at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming q i to be the true distribution of\nthe tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where\n1\nthe codeword for the token x i is of length l i = \u2308log 2 q i (x i ) [\u2309][. A prefix-free code with this length for][ x] [i] [ is guaranteed to exist]\nsince this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT,\nis given by\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n1\nlog 2\n\ufffd q i (x i )\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT =\n\n\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] .\n\n\n\n3) Arithmetic Coding: The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to\ncombine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding\nis well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use q i (x i ) as the probability of token x i at time in the arithmetic\ncoding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as \u03c1 LLM+AC . It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly\noptimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLM+AC \u2248\n\n\n\nN T 1\n\ufffd i=1 log 2 q i (x i )\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] . (7)\n\n\n\nClearly, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and \u03c1 LLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). H ub, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and\n\u03c1 LLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind\nwhen interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.\n\n\nIV. R ESULTS\n\n\nWe used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary\nof size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction\nwith the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase\nletters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet\nis restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between\nthese models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM.\n[Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip)\nLLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ\nalgorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the\npaq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to\nbe best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ\nor paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.\nThe performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average\nperformance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with\nArithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the\nstate-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the\nLLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I\nalso shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by\nShannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].\nThe dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M ) is shown in Table II. As expected, the\ncompression performance improves with increasing M . We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly\nwith the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a\nmemory of 31 tokens.\nIt is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and\nhence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and\ncompression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds\nto estimates obtained from different input sizes.\nIt appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset\nis derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.\n\n\n6\n\n\nTherefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project\nGutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8\ndataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset.\nTable IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the\nentropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper\nbound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of\nLLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression\nratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).\nTo provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors,\nwe also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the\nlast column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm\nmay not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the\nLLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.\n\n\nV.

The document will continue with a detailed explanation of "III. Compression Using LLMs". This section will formally define the language model's operation, including the probability mass function `q_i(x_i) := Pr(X_i = x_i | x_i-1, ..., x_i-M)` for predicting the next token `x_i` given `M` past tokens, and the definition of token ranks `r_i := gamma_i(x_i)`. It will introduce the compression ratio `rho := N_b / N_c` (bits/character).

"III.A. Entropy bounds" will present mathematical derivations for the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate `H(S)` of English. Key equations will include the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem for characters (Eq. 2) and tokens (Eq. 3), the relationship `lim_{i->infinity} m_i(S)/i = E[B]` (Eq. 4), and the derived relationship `H(S) = H(X) / E[B]`. The asymptotic upper bound `H_ub` will be formally defined by Equation (6): `H(S) <= lim_{N_T->infinity} (-1/N_T sum_{i=1}^{N_T} log2 q_i(X_i)) / E[B]`. Previous entropy estimates by Cover and King [1] (1.3 bits/character) and recent neural network-based estimates [2] will be referenced.

"III.B. Encoding schemes" will describe three specific lossless compression methods:
1.  **LLaMA+zlib:** Compressing the sequence of ranks `r_i` using the zlib algorithm, with compression ratio `rho_LLaMA+zlib`.
2.  **Token-by-Token Compression (LLaMA+TbyT):** Using a time-varying prefix-free code (e.g., Huffman-like) where the codeword length for token `x_i` is `l_i = ceil(log2(1/q_i(x_i)))`. The compression ratio `rho_LLaMA+TbyT` will be given by `(sum_{i=1}^{N_T} ceil(log2(1/q_i(x_i)))) / (sum_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.
3.  **Arithmetic Coding (LLM+AC):** Combining the LLM's output probabilities `q_i(x_i)` with arithmetic coding [4, 9]. The expected compression ratio `rho_LLM+AC` will be approximated by Equation (7): `(sum_{i=1}^{N_T} log2(1/q_i(x_i))) / (sum_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.

"IV. Results" will detail the experimental setup and findings. It will specify the use of LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and the SentencePiece tokenizer [11] (dictionary size 32000). The datasets used will be a 1MB section of the `text8` dataset (from `http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip`) and a 100KB section from a recently published Project Gutenberg book [7]. Baselines for comparison will include ZPAQ (1.4 bpc [5]) and paq8h (1.2 bpc [12]) on the `text8` dataset, and standalone zlib (2.8 bpc) on the Project Gutenberg text.

Results will be presented in tables:
-   **Table I:** Performance of LLaMA-7B on 1MB of `text8` data across 10 batches, showing `H_ub`, `rho_LLaMA+zlib`, `rho_LLaMA+TbyT`, and `rho_LLM+AC`. The average `H_ub` will be 0.7093 bpc and `rho_LLM+AC` will be 0.7101 bpc, outperforming ZPAQ (1.4 bpc) and paq8h (1.2 bpc).
-   **Table II:** Compression performance on `text8` as a function of LLM memory `M` (31, 127, 255, 511 tokens), demonstrating improved performance with increasing `M`.
-   **Table III:** Mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios over 10 batches for different `M` values.
-   **Table IV:** Compression performance on the Project Gutenberg book [7] for different `M` values, including a comparison with standalone zlib (2.8 bpc). For M=511, `H_ub` will be 0.8417 bpc and `rho_LLM+AC` will be 0.8426 bpc.

The discussion will address potential biases (LLaMA-7B trained on Wikipedia, `text8` derived from Wikipedia), limitations (LLaMA-7B not run on the full 100MB `text8` dataset), and the observation that inference time scales linearly with memory `M`.

"V. Acknowledgement" will thank Andreas Kirsch for discussions on arithmetic coding.

Finally, a "References" section will list 12 academic sources, including foundational works by Shannon [3], Cover and King [1], information theory textbooks [8, 10], and papers on LLMs [6] and tokenizers [11].

"III.A. Entropy bounds" will present mathematical derivations for the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate `H(S)` of English. Key equations will include the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem for characters (Eq. 2) and tokens (Eq. 3), the relationship `lim_{i->infinity} m_i(S)/i = E[B]` (Eq. 4), and the derived relationship `H(S) = H(X) / E[B]`. The asymptotic upper bound `H_ub` will be formally defined by Equation (6): `H(S) <= lim_{N_T->infinity} (-1/N_T sum_{i=1}^{N_T} log2 q_i(X_i)) / E[B]`. Previous entropy estimates by Cover and King [1] (1.3 bits/character) and recent neural network-based estimates [2] will be referenced.

"III.B. Encoding schemes" will describe three specific lossless compression methods:
1.  **LLaMA+zlib:** Compressing the sequence of ranks `r_i` using the zlib algorithm, with compression ratio `rho_LLaMA+zlib`.
2.  **Token-by-Token Compression (LLaMA+TbyT):** Using a time-varying prefix-free code (e.g., Huffman-like) where the codeword length for token `x_i` is `l_i = ceil(log2(1/q_i(x_i)))`. The compression ratio `rho_LLaMA+TbyT` will be given by `(sum_{i=1}^{N_T} ceil(log2(1/q_i(x_i)))) / (sum_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.
3.  **Arithmetic Coding (LLM+AC):** Combining the LLM's output probabilities `q_i(x_i)` with arithmetic coding [4, 9]. The expected compression ratio `rho_LLM+AC` will be approximated by Equation (7): `(sum_{i=1}^{N_T} log2(1/q_i(x_i))) / (sum_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.

"IV. Results" will detail the experimental setup and findings. It will specify the use of LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and the SentencePiece tokenizer [11] (dictionary size 32000). The datasets used will be a 1MB section of the `text8` dataset (from `http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip`) and a 100KB section from a recently published Project Gutenberg book [7]. Baselines for comparison will include ZPAQ (1.4 bpc [5]) and paq8h (1.2 bpc [12]) on the `text8` dataset, and standalone zlib (2.8 bpc) on the Project Gutenberg text.

Results will be presented in tables:
-   **Table I:** Performance of LLaMA-7B on 1MB of `text8` data across 10 batches, showing `H_ub`, `rho_LLaMA+zlib`, `rho_LLaMA+TbyT`, and `rho_LLM+AC`. The average `H_ub` will be 0.7093 bpc and `rho_LLM+AC` will be 0.7101 bpc, outperforming ZPAQ (1.4 bpc) and paq8h (1.2 bpc).
-   **Table II:** Compression performance on `text8` as a function of LLM memory `M` (31, 127, 255, 511 tokens), demonstrating improved performance with increasing `M`.
-   **Table III:** Mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios over 10 batches for different `M` values.
-   **Table IV:** Compression performance on the Project Gutenberg book [7] for different `M` values, including a comparison with standalone zlib (2.8 bpc). For M=511, `H_ub` will be 0.8417 bpc and `rho_LLM+AC` will be 0.8426 bpc.

The discussion will address potential biases (LLaMA-7B trained on Wikipedia, `text8` derived from Wikipedia), limitations (LLaMA-7B not run on the full 100MB `text8` dataset), and the observation that inference time scales linearly with memory `M`.

"V. Acknowledgement" will thank Andreas Kirsch for discussions on arithmetic coding.

Finally, a "References" section will list 12 academic sources, including foundational works by Shannon [3], Cover and King [1], information theory textbooks [8, 10], and papers on LLMs [6] and tokenizers [11].

## Abstract

We provide new estimates of an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy of English using the large language model LLaMA-7B as a predictor for the next token given a window of past tokens. This estimate is significantly smaller than currently available estimates in [1], [2]. A natural byproduct is an algorithm for lossless compression of English text which combines the prediction from the large language model with a lossless compression scheme. Preliminary results from limited experiments suggest that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art text compression schemes such as BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.

## I. INTRODUCTION

There are close connections between learning, prediction, and compression. The success of ChatGPT has captured the fascination of general public and brought the connection between learning and prediction to the fore. The main advance brought about by large language models such as LLaMA and GPT-4 is that they excel at predicting the next word (token) in a paragraph based on knowing the past several words (tokens).

The connection between prediction and compression was explored as early as 1951 by Shannon in order to estimate the entropy of the English language [3]. The idea that a good predictor for the ith value in a time series based on the past values can be effectively converted to a good compression algorithm has played a prominent role in information theory. Many algorithms for speech, image, and video compression exploit this idea either explicitly or implicitly. Within the context of lossless compression of English text, the idea of combining a language model with arithmetic coding has emerged as a very effective paradigm [4]. The performance of such a compression scheme depends substantially on the efficacy of the predictor and every time there is a major advance in the prediction capability, it behooves us to study its effect on the compression performance. Indeed, in 2018, the authors of [5] used recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the predictor and reported improved results for certain kinds of sources. Their scheme still did not outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as BSC and ZPAQ for text compression.

It is therefore natural at this time to study whether we can obtain better compression results and sharper estimates of the entropy of the English language using recent large language models such as LLaMA-7B [6]. This is the main goal of this paper. We show that when the LLaMA-7B large language model is used as the predictor, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is 0.709 bits/character when estimated using a 1MB section of the text8 dataset. This is smaller than earlier estimates provided in [1] and [2, Table 4]. The estimate of the upper bound increases to 0.85 bits/character for a 100 KB section of the text from [7], which is still lower than the estimates in [2]. When LLaMA-7B is combined with an Arithmetic coder for compression, we obtain a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character on a 1MB section of the text8 dataset and a compression ratio of 0.8426 bits/character on a 100KB section of a text from [7], which are significantly better than the compression ratio obtained using BSC, ZPAQ and pq8h on the full 100MB of the text8 dataset.

## II. INTUITIVE EXPLANATION OF THE MAIN IDEA

We will use the following example to describe the main idea, which is nearly identical to that proposed by Shannon in [3] for estimating the entropy of English. The main difference is in the use of tokens which represent groups of letters of variable length and in the use of a large language model instead of a human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence that reads as

My first attempt at writing a book

Our goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can be reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)

′My′, ′first′, ′attempt′, ′at′, ′writing′, ′a′, ′book′

A language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the past M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in Figure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be words such as ′reading′,′ writing′,′ driving′,′ cooking′ etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in our sentence (′writing′) in this list and call it R5. We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank 0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for ′writing′ is R5 = 1.

**Fig. 1.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| reading  | 0.3        |
| writing  | 0.2        |
| cycling  | 0.1        |
| driving  | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R5 = 1

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M

Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the\nrank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be\n\n\n1, 0, 0, . . .\n\n\nA sequence with many \u20180\u2019s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the\nranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the\nranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\nSequence of ranks\n\n|e of ranks|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|. ., rNT|Compression (zip)|Nb|\n||||\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.\n\n\nWhen we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language\nmodel one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at\nrank R i during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the\nsame LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.\n\nThe idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the\nprobabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.\n\n\n3\n\n\nIII. C OMPRESSION USING LLM S\n\n\nLet s denote a sentence from the English language composed of N c letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the\nalphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of N T tokens\ndenoted by x = x 1, x 2, . . ., x i\u22121, x i, x i+1, . . . x N T, where x i \u2208X . There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence,\ncompressing s is the same as compressing x. x i \u2019s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the\nupper case letter X i .\nA language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens x i\u2212M, x i\u2212M+1, . . ., x i\u22121\nand produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by\nq i (x i ) := Pr(X i = x i |x i\u22121, x i\u22122, . . ., x i\u2212M ), \u2200x i \u2208X . The PMF vector q i := [q i (1), q i (2), . . ., q i (D)] [T] is sorted in\ndescending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by \u02dcq i . Let \u03b3 i : X \u2192X be a permutation on the integers\nfrom 1 to D such that\n\n\u02dc\nq i (\u03b3 i (j)) = q i (j), \u2200j \u2208X .\n\n\nThat is, \u03b3 i (j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the\ntoken x i at epoch i, r i := \u03b3 i (x i ). The sequence {r i } [N] i=1 [T] [is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to]\nproduce N b bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general,\nthe lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors q i \u2019s in addition to the sequence of ranks.\nThe main metric of interest is the compression ratio \u03c1 defined as\n\n\u03c1 := [N] [b] bits/character.\n\nN c\n\n\n\nLosseless\n\nCompression\n\n\n\nTokens . . ., x i\u2212M, . . ., x i\u22121\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n\nInput sentence s with N c characters\n\n\n\ni i i\u22121 Rank\n\nLLM\ncomputation\n\n\n\nq i = Pr(X i = j|x [i] i [\u2212] \u2212 [M] 1 [)] Rank r i Losseless N b bits\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.\n\n\nA. Entropy bounds\n\n\nLet S \u2208S [\u221e] be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by S n,\nwhereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as S n . The tokenizer parses the input\nstring and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X 1, X 2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, X i is the ith\ntoken. The number of characters employed to generate X i depends on the realization of the random process and, as such,\nwe introduce random variable B i to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical\nconsiderations, we only admit tokenizers for which B i \u2265 1 and B i is uniformly bounded, with B i < B < \u221e; these are\ncharacteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens\ngrows unbounded N T \u2192\u221e, the number of characters must also approach infinity N c \u2192\u221e. Formally, consider the tokenizer\nfunction T : S [N] \u2192X [N] operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S [\u221e] . For\nnatural number, i \u2208 N, define m i : S [N] \u2192 N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an\ninput sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then\n\n\nm i (s) = min n [{][length (][T][ (][s] [n] [))][ \u2265] [i][}][ .] (1)\n\n\nWe note that, by construction, lim n\u2192\u221e length (T (s n )) = \u221e and, as such, m i (\u00b7) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress\nthat the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map\nto the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially\nmay be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances\nwhere T (s n ) = T (s n+1 ). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the\nrestricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted\nset for which T (y n ) = x i is s m i (s) . Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token\n\nas\nb i = m i (s) \u2212 m i\u22121 (s)\n\n\n4\n\n\nwith initial condition m \u22121 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first N T tokens for a random input\nbecomes N c = [\ufffd] i [N] =1 [T] [B] [i] [.]\nHaving established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {S k } [\u221e] k=1 [,]\n{B i } [\u221e] i=1 [, and][ {][X] [i] [}] [\u221e] i=1 [are stationary and ergodic processes. We know from the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem [8] that]\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\nn [log] [2] [ p] [S] [n] [(][S] [1] [, . . ., S] [n] [) =][ \u2212] n [1]\n\n\n\nn [log] [2] [ p] [S] [n] [(][S] [n] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][S][)] almost surely. (2)\n\n\n\nLet \u2126 S be the collection of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem\nimplies\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [1] [, . . ., X] [i] [) =][ \u2212] [1] i\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [i] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][X][)] almost surely.

(4)\ni\u2192\u221e i\n\n\nSet \u2126 B to be the set of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. For any \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 S \u2229 \u2126 X \u2229 \u2126 B, we deduce that\n\n\nH(S) = lim\nk\u2192\u221e [\u2212] k [1] [log] [2] [ p] [S] [k] [(][S] [k] [(][\u03c9][))]\n\n= lim i\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i log 2 p S li (S l i (\u03c9))\n\n\n= lim log 2 Pr (X i = T (S l i (\u03c9)))\ni\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i\n\n\n\n1\n\ni [log] [2] [ Pr (][X] [i] [ =][ x] [i] [) =][ H] E [(] B [X][)]\n\n\n\n1 1\n\n= \u2212\nE[B] i [lim] \u2192\u221e i\n\n\n\nE[B] [.]\n\n\n\nThe first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {l i = m i (S(\u03c9))|i \u2208 N} is an infinite\nsubset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately\ngather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following\n\ntwo events,\n{\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|X i (\u03c9) = x i } = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|T (S m i (S(\u03c9)) ) = x i }.\n\n\nThis is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step\nholds because we are considering an \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 B . The sets \u2126 S, \u2126 X, and \u2126 B each have probability one; this implies that their\nintersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that\n\nH(S) = [H][(][X][)] almost surely.\n\nE[B]\n\n\nAs a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to\nexploit.\nThen, from the results of [1], we can see that\n\n\n\nPr\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nH(X) \u2264 lim\nN T \u2192\u221e [\u2212] N [1] T\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd log 2 q i (X i )\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n= 1, (5)\n\n\n\nwhere q i (\u00b7) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is\ngiven by\n\n\n\n\n[1] N T\n\nN T \ufffd i=1 [log] 2 [q] [i] [(][X] [i] [)]\n\n\n\nH(S) \u2264 lim N T \u2192\u221e \u2212 N [1]\n\n\n\n. (6)\nE[B]\n\n\n\nWe refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by H ub . The\nnumerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens X N T and the denominator in (6) is\nthe average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3\nbits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and\ndiscussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance\nof several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc\nis the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.\n\n\nB. Encoding schemes\n\n\nWe consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.\n\n\n5\n\n\n1) Compressing the ranks using zlib: The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks.\nWe refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib .\n2) Token-by-Token Compression: The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a\ntime-varying codebook to encode the token x i at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming q i to be the true distribution of\nthe tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where\n1\nthe codeword for the token x i is of length l i = \u2308log 2 q i (x i ) [\u2309][. A prefix-free code with this length for][ x] [i] [ is guaranteed to exist]\nsince this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT,\nis given by\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n1\nlog 2\n\ufffd q i (x i )\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT =\n\n\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] .\n\n\n\n3) Arithmetic Coding: The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to\ncombine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding\nis well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use q i (x i ) as the probability of token x i at time in the arithmetic\ncoding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as \u03c1 LLM+AC . It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly\noptimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLM+AC \u2248\n\n\n\nN T 1\n\ufffd i=1 log 2 q i (x i )\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] . (7)\n\n\n\nClearly, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and \u03c1 LLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). H ub, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and\n\u03c1 LLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind\nwhen interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.\n\n\nIV. R ESULTS\n\n\nWe used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary\nof size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction\nwith the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase\nletters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet\nis restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between\nthese models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM.\n[Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip)\nLLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ\nalgorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the\npaq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to\nbe best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ\nor paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.\nThe performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average\nperformance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with\nArithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the\nstate-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the\nLLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I\nalso shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by\nShannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].\nThe dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M ) is shown in Table II. As expected, the\ncompression performance improves with increasing M . We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly\nwith the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a\nmemory of 31 tokens.\nIt is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and\nhence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and\ncompression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds\nto estimates obtained from different input sizes.\nIt appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset\nis derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.\n\n\n6\n\n\nTherefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project\nGutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8\ndataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset.\nTable IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the\nentropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper\nbound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of\nLLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression\nratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).\nTo provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors,\nwe also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the\nlast column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm\nmay not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the\nLLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.\n\n\nV.

The document prefix already provided sections I, II, and the beginning of III. I will now read the entire paper to get the full context and then synthesize the synopsis.
Based on the document prefix, the paper is about using LLaMA-7B for lossless text compression and estimating the entropy of English.
The abstract and introduction mention:

- This estimate is significantly smaller than previous estimates ([1], [2]).
- A byproduct is a lossless compression algorithm combining LLaMA-7B prediction with a lossless compression scheme.
- Preliminary results suggest it outperforms BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.
- Specific entropy bounds: 0.709 bits/character (1MB text8) and 0.85 bits/character (100KB text from [7]).
- Specific compression ratios: 0.7101 bits/character (1MB text8) and 0.8426 bits/character (100KB text from [7]).
- The intuitive explanation (Section II) details how LLaMA predicts next tokens and how ranks are compressed. It also mentions that using probabilities with arithmetic coding is better than compressing ranks.
Section III, "Compression Using LLMs", has started and will likely detail:
- The formal definition of the language model and tokenization process.
- Mathematical formulations for entropy bounds.
- Specific encoding schemes (LLaMA+zlib, Token-by-Token Compression, Arithmetic Coding).
Therefore, I expect the following content to appear later in the document:

This estimate is significantly smaller than currently available\nestimates in [1], [2]. A natural byproduct is an algorithm for lossless compression of English text which combines the prediction\nfrom the large language model with a lossless compression scheme. Preliminary results from limited experiments suggest that our\nscheme outperforms state-of-the-art text compression schemes such as BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.\n\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\n\n\nThere are close connections between learning, prediction, and compression. The success of ChatGPT has captured the\nfascination of general public and brought the connection between learning and prediction to the fore. The main advance\nbrought about by large language models such as LLaMA and GPT-4 is that they excel at predicting the next word (token) in\na paragraph based on knowing the past several words (tokens).\nThe connection between prediction and compression was explored as early as 1951 by Shannon in order to estimate the\nentropy of the English language [3]. The idea that a good predictor for the ith value in a time series based on the past\nvalues can be effectively converted to a good compression algorithm has played a prominent role in information theory. Many\nalgorithms for speech, image, and video compression exploit this idea either explicitly or implicitly. Within the context of\nlossless compression of English text, the idea of combining a language model with arithmetic coding has emerged as a very\neffective paradigm [4]. The performance of such a compression scheme depends substantially on the efficacy of the predictor\nand every time there is a major advance in the prediction capability, it behooves us to study its effect on the compression\nperformance. Indeed, in 2018, the authors of [5] used recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the predictor and reported improved\nresults for certain kinds of sources. Their scheme still did not outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as BSC and ZPAQ\nfor text compression.\nIt is therefore natural at this time to study whether we can obtain better compression results and sharper estimates of the\nentropy of the English language using recent large language models such as LLaMA-7B [6]. This is the main goal of this\npaper. We show that when the LLaMA-7B large language model is used as the predictor, the asymptotic upper bound on the\nentropy is 0.709 bits/character when estimated using a 1MB section of the text8 dataset. This is smaller than earlier estimates\nprovided in [1] and [2, Table 4]. The estimate of the upper bound increases to 0.85 bits/character for a 100 KB section of\nthe text from [7], which is still lower than the estimates in [2]. When LLaMA-7B is combined with an Arithmetic coder for\ncompression, we obtain a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character on a 1MB section of the text8 dataset and a compression\nratio of 0.8426 bits/character on a 100KB section of a text from [7], which are significantly better than the compression ratio\nobtained using BSC, ZPAQ and pq8h on the full 100MB of the text8 dataset.\n\n\nII. I NTUITIVE EXPLANATION OF THE MAIN IDEA\n\n\nWe will use the following example to describe the main idea, which is nearly identical to that proposed by Shannon in [3]\nfor estimating the entropy of English. The main difference is in the use of tokens which represent groups of letters of variable\nlength and in the use of a large language model instead of a human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence\nthat reads as\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\nOur goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can\nbe reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)\n\n\n\u2032 My \u2032, \u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032, \u2032 writing \u2032, \u2032 a \u2032, \u2032 book \u2032\n\n\nA language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the\npast M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in\n\n\n2\n\n\nFigure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be\nwords such as [\u2032] reading [\u2032], [\u2032] writing [\u2032], [\u2032] driving [\u2032], [\u2032] cooking [\u2032] etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in\nour sentence ( [\u2032] writing [\u2032] ) in this list and call it R 5 . We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank\n0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for [\u2032] writing [\u2032] is R 5 = 1.\n\n\nTokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032 My \u2032, \u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n|Col1|LLM|q = Pr(x5|x4 1)<br>5|Rank<br>computation|R5 = 1|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||LLM|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>||\n\n\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreading 0.3\nwriting 0.2\ncycling 0.1\ndriving 0.05\n\n... ...\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nThen, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2\nthrough 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same\nword in the sentence that we wish to encode, [\u2032] a [\u2032], and hence, the rank R 6 would be 0.\n\n\nTokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2032 first \u2032, \u2032 attempt \u2032, \u2032 at \u2032, \u2032 writing \u2032\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n|Col1|LLM|q = Pr(x6|x5 2)<br>6|Rank<br>computation|R6 = 0|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||LLM|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>|Next word<br>Probability<br><br>||\n\n\n\nMy first attempt at writing a book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nan 0.2\n\nthe 0.05\n\n... ...\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.\n\n\nIf the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the\nrank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the\nrank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be\n\n\n1, 0, 0, . . .\n\n\nA sequence with many \u20180\u2019s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the\nranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the\nranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\nSequence of ranks\n\n|e of ranks|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|. ., rNT|Compression (zip)|Nb|\n||||\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.\n\n\nWhen we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language\nmodel one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at\nrank R i during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the\nsame LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.\n\nThe idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the\nprobabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.\n\n\n3\n\n\nIII. C OMPRESSION USING LLM S\n\n\nLet s denote a sentence from the English language composed of N c letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the\nalphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of N T tokens\ndenoted by x = x 1, x 2, . . ., x i\u22121, x i, x i+1, . . . x N T, where x i \u2208X . There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence,\ncompressing s is the same as compressing x. x i \u2019s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the\nupper case letter X i .\nA language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens x i\u2212M, x i\u2212M+1, . . ., x i\u22121\nand produces a probability mass function for the next token in the sequence conditioned on the past M tokens given by\nq i (x i ) := Pr(X i = x i |x i\u22121, x i\u22122, . . ., x i\u2212M ), \u2200x i \u2208X . The PMF vector q i := [q i (1), q i (2), . . ., q i (D)] [T] is sorted in\ndescending order and let the sorted PMF vector be denoted by \u02dcq i . Let \u03b3 i : X \u2192X be a permutation on the integers\nfrom 1 to D such that\n\n\u02dc\nq i (\u03b3 i (j)) = q i (j), \u2200j \u2208X .\n\n\nThat is, \u03b3 i (j) is the rank of the token j at epoch i. We define the rank of the input sequence at epoch i as the rank of the\ntoken x i at epoch i, r i := \u03b3 i (x i ). The sequence {r i } [N] i=1 [T] [is compressed by a lossless compression algorithm (such as zlib) to]\nproduce N b bits which are the final bit representation of the source. A schematic of this scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In general,\nthe lossless compression algorithm may use the sequence of PMF vectors q i \u2019s in addition to the sequence of ranks.\nThe main metric of interest is the compression ratio \u03c1 defined as\n\n\u03c1 := [N] [b] bits/character.\n\nN c\n\n\n\nLosseless\n\nCompression\n\n\n\nTokens . . ., x i\u2212M, . . ., x i\u22121\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tokenizer|Tokenizer|\n|||\n\n\n\nInput sentence s with N c characters\n\n\n\ni i i\u22121 Rank\n\nLLM\ncomputation\n\n\n\nq i = Pr(X i = j|x [i] i [\u2212] \u2212 [M] 1 [)] Rank r i Losseless N b bits\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Schematic showing the prediction at epoch i.\n\n\nA. Entropy bounds\n\n\nLet S \u2208S [\u221e] be a random process that represents language input. The nth character in the sequence is denoted by S n,\nwhereas the string of characters from the beginning to the nth character is expressed as S n . The tokenizer parses the input\nstring and maps it to a sequence of tokens X = X 1, X 2, . . . using a variable-length mapping. In this sequence, X i is the ith\ntoken. The number of characters employed to generate X i depends on the realization of the random process and, as such,\nwe introduce random variable B i to identify the number of characters contained in the ith token. Motivated by practical\nconsiderations, we only admit tokenizers for which B i \u2265 1 and B i is uniformly bounded, with B i < B < \u221e; these are\ncharacteristics of commonly used tokenizers. An immediate consequence of this framework is that, as the number of tokens\ngrows unbounded N T \u2192\u221e, the number of characters must also approach infinity N c \u2192\u221e. Formally, consider the tokenizer\nfunction T : S [N] \u2192X [N] operating on infinite symbol sequences; that is, T (s) = x where s is an infinite sequence in S [\u221e] . For\nnatural number, i \u2208 N, define m i : S [N] \u2192 N to be the (time) index during which the tokenizer working sequentially on an\ninput sequence s outputs its ith token. Specifically, suppose s is given, then\n\n\nm i (s) = min n [{][length (][T][ (][s] [n] [))][ \u2265] [i][}][ .] (1)\n\n\nWe note that, by construction, lim n\u2192\u221e length (T (s n )) = \u221e and, as such, m i (\u00b7) is well-defined. It may be pertinent to stress\nthat the tokenizer function applied to truncated sequences is not necessarily injective because multiple finite input series can map\nto the same output. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, at any point in time, a tokenizer working sequentially\nmay be waiting for an additional symbol before it can unambiguously select the next output token, i.e., there may be instances\nwhere T (s n ) = T (s n+1 ). However, if we restrict the input series to input indices when a new token is produced, then the\nrestricted mapping becomes injective. That is, suppose T (s) = x, then the only (finite) series of input symbols in the restricted\nset for which T (y n ) = x i is s m i (s) . Given a fixed sequence s, we can express the number of characters contained in a token\n\nas\nb i = m i (s) \u2212 m i\u22121 (s)\n\n\n4\n\n\nwith initial condition m \u22121 = 0. Consequently, the number of characters embedded in the first N T tokens for a random input\nbecomes N c = [\ufffd] i [N] =1 [T] [B] [i] [.]\nHaving established these properties, we turn to the relation between H(S) and H(X). We make the assumption that {S k } [\u221e] k=1 [,]\n{B i } [\u221e] i=1 [, and][ {][X] [i] [}] [\u221e] i=1 [are stationary and ergodic processes.

(2)\n\n\n\nLet \u2126 S be the collection of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. In an analogous manner, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem\nimplies\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [1] [, . . ., X] [i] [) =][ \u2212] [1] i\n\n\n\n\u2212 [1]\n\n\n\ni [log] [2] [ p] [X] [i] [(][X] [i] [)][ \u2192] [H][(][X][)] almost surely. (3)\n\n\n\nDefine \u2126 X as the collection of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. Finally, by construction, we have\n\n\nm i (S)\nlim = E [B] almost surely. (4)\ni\u2192\u221e i\n\n\nSet \u2126 B to be the set of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 for which this limit holds. For any \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 S \u2229 \u2126 X \u2229 \u2126 B, we deduce that\n\n\nH(S) = lim\nk\u2192\u221e [\u2212] k [1] [log] [2] [ p] [S] [k] [(][S] [k] [(][\u03c9][))]\n\n= lim i\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i log 2 p S li (S l i (\u03c9))\n\n\n= lim log 2 Pr (X i = T (S l i (\u03c9)))\ni\u2192\u221e [\u2212] l [1] i\n\n\n\n1\n\ni [log] [2] [ Pr (][X] [i] [ =][ x] [i] [) =][ H] E [(] B [X][)]\n\n\n\n1 1\n\n= \u2212\nE[B] i [lim] \u2192\u221e i\n\n\n\nE[B] [.]\n\n\n\nThe first equality follows from (2). The second equality is a consequence of the fact that {l i = m i (S(\u03c9))|i \u2208 N} is an infinite\nsubset of the natural numbers. Since a subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we immediately\ngather that this alternate form approaches H(S). The third equality is a consequence of the equivalence between the following\n\ntwo events,\n{\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|X i (\u03c9) = x i } = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126|T (S m i (S(\u03c9)) ) = x i }.\n\n\nThis is characteristic of the tokenization process, and it is a consequence of the correspondence described above. The last step\nholds because we are considering an \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 B . The sets \u2126 S, \u2126 X, and \u2126 B each have probability one; this implies that their\nintersection also has probability one, Thus, we must conclude that\n\nH(S) = [H][(][X][)] almost surely.\n\nE[B]\n\n\nAs a corollary to this result, any upper bound on H(X) produces an upper bound on H(S). This is the property we wish to\nexploit.\nThen, from the results of [1], we can see that\n\n\n\nPr\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\nH(X) \u2264 lim\nN T \u2192\u221e [\u2212] N [1] T\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\ufffd log 2 q i (X i )\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n= 1, (5)\n\n\n\nwhere q i (\u00b7) is the output PMF from the language model. Therefore, an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate H(S) is\ngiven by\n\n\n\n\n[1] N T\n\nN T \ufffd i=1 [log] 2 [q] [i] [(][X] [i] [)]\n\n\n\nH(S) \u2264 lim N T \u2192\u221e \u2212 N [1]\n\n\n\n. (6)\nE[B]\n\n\n\nWe refer to the expression in the right hand side of (6) as the asymptotic upper bound on H(S) and denote it by H ub . The\nnumerator in (6) represents the average number of bits required to represent the tokens X N T and the denominator in (6) is\nthe average number of charcaters per token. Hence, the unit for H(S) is bits/character. In [1], Cover and King provide 1.3\nbits/character as an estimate of the asymptotic upper bound on H(S). They also provide an extensive list of references and\ndiscussion of the literature on estimating the entropy of English prior to 1976. Very recently, in [2, Table 4], the performance\nof several language models have evaluated on the text8 dataset using a metric called bits per character (bpc). We believe bpc\nis the same as the asymptotic upper bound in this paper.\n\n\nB. Encoding schemes\n\n\nWe consider three schemes for the lossless compression block in Fig. 3.\n\n\n5\n\n\n1) Compressing the ranks using zlib: The first scheme uses the zlib compression algorithm to encode the sequence of ranks.\nWe refer to this scheme as LLaMA+zlib and denote the compression ratio of this scheme by \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib .\n2) Token-by-Token Compression: The second scheme uses a token-by-token lossless compression scheme which uses a\ntime-varying codebook to encode the token x i at epoch i by using a prefix-free code assuming q i to be the true distribution of\nthe tokens. A natural choice for a prefix-free code is a Huffman code. Instead, for simplicity, we use a prefix-free code where\n1\nthe codeword for the token x i is of length l i = \u2308log 2 q i (x i ) [\u2309][. A prefix-free code with this length for][ x] [i] [ is guaranteed to exist]\nsince this choice of lengths satisfies the Kraft inequality [8]. The compression ratio for this scheme, denoted by \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT,\nis given by\n\n\n\nN T\n\ufffd\n\n\ni=1\n\n\n\n1\nlog 2\n\ufffd q i (x i )\n\n\n\n\ufffd\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT =\n\n\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] .\n\n\n\n3) Arithmetic Coding: The above two schemes are intuitive but their performance can be improved. A very effective way to\ncombine the output of the LLM with a lossless compression scheme is by using arithmetic coding [4], [9]. Arithmetic coding\nis well suited to accept time-varying probabilities and we use q i (x i ) as the probability of token x i at time in the arithmetic\ncoding scheme. We refer to the compression ratio of this scheme as \u03c1 LLM+AC . It is known that arithmetic coding is nearly\noptimal as a compression scheme [10, Page 115]. Hence, the compression ratio for this scheme is expected to be\n\n\n\n\u03c1 LLM+AC \u2248\n\n\n\nN T 1\n\ufffd i=1 log 2 q i (x i )\n\n\ufffd Ni=1 T [b] [i] . (7)\n\n\n\nClearly, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and \u03c1 LLM+AC also provide upper bounds on H(S). H ub, \u03c1 LLaMA+zlib, \u03c1 LLaMA+TbyT, and\n\u03c1 LLM+AC are estimated using a finite number of tokens and the statistical properties of such an estimate should be kept in mind\nwhen interpreting the results, especially since the tokens are from a very large alphabet and language model has large memory.\n\n\nIV. R ESULTS\n\n\nWe used LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and SentencePiece tokenizer [11]. The tokenizer produces a dictionary\nof size 32000. Since the language model is trained on this tokenizer, it is imperative that this tokenizer be used in conjunction\nwith the LLM. It should be noted that the tokenizer and the model are trained on a large corpus of text which includes uppercase\nletters, special characters etc. This is in contrast to many studies on estimating the entropy of English, where the input alphabet\nis restricted to lowercase letters such as in [1], [3], [5]. This makes it difficult to perform an entirely fair comparison between\nthese models. By using a pretrained LLM on an input consisting only of lowercase letters, we may be unfair to the LLM.\n[Nevertheless, we used the text8 dataset available from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip to benchmark the performance of](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip)\nLLaMA-7B with compression against other state of the art results for text compression. In [5], it is mentioned that the ZPAQ\nalgorithm obtains the best compression ratio for the text8 dataset with a compression ratio of 1.4 bits/character. In [12], the\npaq8h algorithm is shown to provide a compression ratio of 1.2 bits/character. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to\nbe best performance reported. Therefore, we used these two algorithms as baselines. We did not independently run the ZPAQ\nor paq8h algorithms and we are quoting results from the existing literature.\nThe performance of LLaMA-7B is shown in Table I for 10 different batches each with 100,000 tokens. The average\nperformance over these 1M tokens is also shown in the last row in the Table. It can be seen that using LLaMA-7B with\nArithmetic Coding compression results in a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character. This is substantially better than the\nstate-of-the-art results mentioned in [5] or [12] and is very close to our computed upper bound. The performance with the\nLLaMA+zlib algorithm and LLaMA+TbyT compression are also better than that of the known state-of-the-art results. Table I\nalso shows the upper bound in (6). It should be noted that the upper bound on the entropy is lower than that computed by\nShannon in [3], Cover and King in [1] and more recent estimates based on neural networks in [2].\nThe dependence of the compression performance on the memory of the LLM (M ) is shown in Table II. As expected, the\ncompression performance improves with increasing M . We also observed that the inference time scaled approximately linearly\nwith the input memory length, i.e., batches with a memory of 511 tokens ran about 16 times slower than batches with a\nmemory of 31 tokens.\nIt is well known that the estimate of compression ratio can show substantial variance depending on the input text and\nhence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The empirical mean and standard deviation of the entropy bounds and\ncompression ratios computed using 10 batches of 100,000 tokens are shown in Table III. We were also not able to run LLaMA7B on the entire 100MB of the text8 dataset. So, the comparison of LLaMA-7B with that of the state-of-the-art corresponds\nto estimates obtained from different input sizes.\nIt appears that the LLaMA-7B model was trained on a corpus that included articles from Wikipedia. Since the text8 dataset\nis derived from Wikipedia, it is likely that our results for the text8 dataset are optimistic.\n\n\n6\n\n\nTherefore, we also tested the performance of LLaMA-7B on a recently released (May 25, 2023) book [7] under Project\nGutenberg. We extracted text that corresponds to 100,000 tokens. We applied the same text pre-processing as used in the text8\ndataset to clean the text from the book. The resulting text data contained only lowercase letters and space as in the text8 dataset.\nTable IV shows the compression performance of the LLM on the book. It can be seen that the compression ratios and the\nentropy upper bound are slightly higher compared to the performance on the text8 dataset; nevertheless, the asymptotic upper\nbound on the entropy is lower than that of currently known models given in [2, Table 4]). Similarly, the compression ratio of\nLLaMA-7B-based compressors are better than those of known state-of-the-art results for the text8 dataset. The compression\nratio for LLaMA with arithmetic coding is only 0.8426 bits/character and is very close to the estimated upper bound on H(S).\nTo provide some insight into the comparative performance of LLaMA based compressors vis-a-vis standard text compressors,\nwe also ran the zlib algorithm directly on the input text. The resulting compression ratio was 2.8 bits/character (shown in the\nlast column). It is clear that the performance of LLaMA based compressors is substantially better than this. The zlib algorithm\nmay not be optimized for compressing small text samples and hence, the compression ratio for the zlib algorithm and the\nLLaMA+zlib will likely improve on longer texts.\n\n\nV.

The document will continue with a detailed explanation of "III. Compression Using LLMs". This section will formally define the language model's operation, including the probability mass function `q_i(x_i) := Pr(X_i = x_i | x_i-1, ..., x_i-M)` for predicting the next token `x_i` given `M` past tokens, and the definition of token ranks `r_i := gamma_i(x_i)`. It will introduce the compression ratio `rho := N_b / N_c` (bits/character).

"III.A. Entropy bounds" will present mathematical derivations for the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate `H(S)` of English. Key equations will include the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem for characters (Eq. 2) and tokens (Eq. 3), the relationship `lim_{i->infinity} m_i(S)/i = E[B]` (Eq. 4), and the derived relationship `H(S) = H(X) / E[B]`. The asymptotic upper bound `H_ub` will be formally defined by Equation (6): `H(S) <= lim_{N_T->infinity} (-1/N_T sum_{i=1}^{N_T} log2 q_i(X_i)) / E[B]`. Previous entropy estimates by Cover and King [1] (1.3 bits/character) and recent neural network-based estimates [2] will be referenced.

"III.B. Encoding schemes" will describe three specific lossless compression methods:
1.  **LLaMA+zlib:** Compressing the sequence of ranks `r_i` using the zlib algorithm, with compression ratio `rho_LLaMA+zlib`.
2.  **Token-by-Token Compression (LLaMA+TbyT):** Using a time-varying prefix-free code (e.g., Huffman-like) where the codeword length for token `x_i` is `l_i = ceil(log2(1/q_i(x_i)))`. The compression ratio `rho_LLaMA+TbyT` will be given by `(sum_{i=1}^{N_T} ceil(log2(1/q_i(x_i)))) / (sum_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.
3.  **Arithmetic Coding (LLM+AC):** Combining the LLM's output probabilities `q_i(x_i)` with arithmetic coding [4, 9]. The expected compression ratio `rho_LLM+AC` will be approximated by Equation (7): `(sum_{i=1}^{N_T} log2(1/q_i(x_i))) / (sum_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.

"IV. Results" will detail the experimental setup and findings. It will specify the use of LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and the SentencePiece tokenizer [11] (dictionary size 32000). The datasets used will be a 1MB section of the `text8` dataset (from `http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip`) and a 100KB section from a recently published Project Gutenberg book [7]. Baselines for comparison will include ZPAQ (1.4 bpc [5]) and paq8h (1.2 bpc [12]) on the `text8` dataset, and standalone zlib (2.8 bpc) on the Project Gutenberg text.

Results will be presented in tables:
-   **Table I:** Performance of LLaMA-7B on 1MB of `text8` data across 10 batches, showing `H_ub`, `rho_LLaMA+zlib`, `rho_LLaMA+TbyT`, and `rho_LLM+AC`. The average `H_ub` will be 0.7093 bpc and `rho_LLM+AC` will be 0.7101 bpc, outperforming ZPAQ (1.4 bpc) and paq8h (1.2 bpc).
-   **Table II:** Compression performance on `text8` as a function of LLM memory `M` (31, 127, 255, 511 tokens), demonstrating improved performance with increasing `M`.
-   **Table III:** Mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios over 10 batches for different `M` values.
-   **Table IV:** Compression performance on the Project Gutenberg book [7] for different `M` values, including a comparison with standalone zlib (2.8 bpc). For M=511, `H_ub` will be 0.8417 bpc and `rho_LLM+AC` will be 0.8426 bpc.

The discussion will address potential biases (LLaMA-7B trained on Wikipedia, `text8` derived from Wikipedia), limitations (LLaMA-7B not run on the full 100MB `text8` dataset), and the observation that inference time scales linearly with memory `M`.

"V. Acknowledgement" will thank Andreas Kirsch for discussions on arithmetic coding.

Finally, a "References" section will list 12 academic sources, including foundational works by Shannon [3], Cover and King [1], information theory textbooks [8, 10], and papers on LLMs [6] and tokenizers [11].

"III.A. Entropy bounds" will present mathematical derivations for the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy rate `H(S)` of English. Key equations will include the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem for characters (Eq. 2) and tokens (Eq. 3), the relationship `lim_{i->infinity} m_i(S)/i = E[B]` (Eq. 4), and the derived relationship `H(S) = H(X) / E[B]`. The asymptotic upper bound `H_ub` will be formally defined by Equation (6): `H(S) <= lim_{N_T->infinity} (-1/N_T sum_{i=1}^{N_T} log2 q_i(X_i)) / E[B]`. Previous entropy estimates by Cover and King [1] (1.3 bits/character) and recent neural network-based estimates [2] will be referenced.

"III.B. Encoding schemes" will describe three specific lossless compression methods:
1.  **LLaMA+zlib:** Compressing the sequence of ranks `r_i` using the zlib algorithm, with compression ratio `rho_LLaMA+zlib`.
2.  **Token-by-Token Compression (LLaMA+TbyT):** Using a time-varying prefix-free code (e.g., Huffman-like) where the codeword length for token `x_i` is `l_i = ceil(log2(1/q_i(x_i)))`. The compression ratio `rho_LLaMA+TbyT` will be given by `(sum_{i=1}^{N_T} ceil(log2(1/q_i(x_i)))) / (sum_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.
> Stop watching for updates
3.  **Arithmetic Coding (LLM+AC):** Combining the LLM's output probabilities `q_i(x_i)` with arithmetic coding [4, 9]. The expected compression ratio `rho_LLM+AC` will be approximated by Equation (7): `(sum_{i=1}^{N_T} log2(1/q_i(x_i))) / (sum_{i=1}^{N_T} b_i)`.

"IV. Results" will detail the experimental setup and findings. It will specify the use of LLaMA-7B [6] as the large language model and the SentencePiece tokenizer [11] (dictionary size 32000). The datasets used will be a 1MB section of the `text8` dataset (from `http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip`) and a 100KB section from a recently published Project Gutenberg book [7]. Baselines for comparison will include ZPAQ (1.4 bpc [5]) and paq8h (1.2 bpc [12]) on the `text8` dataset, and standalone zlib (2.8 bpc) on the Project Gutenberg text.

Results will be presented in tables:
-   **Table I:** Performance of LLaMA-7B on 1MB of `text8` data across 10 batches, showing `H_ub`, `rho_LLaMA+zlib`, `rho_LLaMA+TbyT`, and `rho_LLM+AC`. The average `H_ub` will be 0.7093 bpc and `rho_LLM+AC` will be 0.7101 bpc, outperforming ZPAQ (1.4 bpc) and paq8h (1.2 bpc).
-   **Table II:** Compression performance on `text8` as a function of LLM memory `M` (31, 127, 255, 511 tokens), demonstrating improved performance with increasing `M`.
-   **Table III:** Mean and standard deviation of entropy bounds and compression ratios over 10 batches for different `M` values.
-   **Table IV:** Compression performance on the Project Gutenberg book [7] for different `M` values, including a comparison with standalone zlib (2.8 bpc). For M=511, `H_ub` will be 0.8417 bpc and `rho_LLM+AC` will be 0.8426 bpc.

The discussion will address potential biases (LLaMA-7B trained on Wikipedia, `text8` derived from Wikipedia), limitations (LLaMA-7B not run on the full 100MB `text8` dataset), and the observation that inference time scales linearly with memory `M`.

"V. Acknowledgement" will thank Andreas Kirsch for discussions on arithmetic coding.

Finally, a "References" section will list 12 academic sources, including foundational works by Shannon [3], Cover and King [1], information theory textbooks [8, 10], and papers on LLMs [6] and tokenizers [11].

## Abstract

We provide new estimates of an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy of English using the large language model LLaMA-7B as a predictor for the next token given a window of past tokens. This estimate is significantly smaller than currently available estimates in [1], [2]. A natural byproduct is an algorithm for lossless compression of English text which combines the prediction from the large language model with a lossless compression scheme. Preliminary results from limited experiments suggest that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art text compression schemes such as BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.

## I. INTRODUCTION

There are close connections between learning, prediction, and compression. The success of ChatGPT has captured the fascination of general public and brought the connection between learning and prediction to the fore. The main advance brought about by large language models such as LLaMA and GPT-4 is that they excel at predicting the next word (token) in a paragraph based on knowing the past several words (tokens).

The connection between prediction and compression was explored as early as 1951 by Shannon in order to estimate the entropy of the English language [3]. The idea that a good predictor for the ith value in a time series based on the past values can be effectively converted to a good compression algorithm has played a prominent role in information theory. Many algorithms for speech, image, and video compression exploit this idea either explicitly or implicitly. Within the context of lossless compression of English text, the idea of combining a language model with arithmetic coding has emerged as a very effective paradigm [4]. The performance of such a compression scheme depends substantially on the efficacy of the predictor and every time there is a major advance in the prediction capability, it behooves us to study its effect on the compression performance. Indeed, in 2018, the authors of [5] used recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the predictor and reported improved results for certain kinds of sources. Their scheme still did not outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as BSC and ZPAQ for text compression.

It is therefore natural at this time to study whether we can obtain better compression results and sharper estimates of the entropy of the English language using recent large language models such as LLaMA-7B [6]. This is the main goal of this paper. We show that when the LLaMA-7B large language model is used as the predictor, the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy is 0.709 bits/character when estimated using a 1MB section of the text8 dataset. This is smaller than earlier estimates provided in [1] and [2, Table 4]. The estimate of the upper bound increases to 0.85 bits/character for a 100 KB section of the text from [7], which is still lower than the estimates in [2]. When LLaMA-7B is combined with an Arithmetic coder for compression, we obtain a compression ratio of 0.7101 bits/character on a 1MB section of the text8 dataset and a compression ratio of 0.8426 bits/character on a 100KB section of a text from [7], which are significantly better than the compression ratio obtained using BSC, ZPAQ and pq8h on the full 100MB of the text8 dataset.

## II. INTUITIVE EXPLANATION OF THE MAIN IDEA

We will use the following example to describe the main idea, which is nearly identical to that proposed by Shannon in [3] for estimating the entropy of English. The main difference is in the use of tokens which represent groups of letters of variable length and in the use of a large language model instead of a human to predict the next token. Consider a part of the sentence that reads as

My first attempt at writing a book

Our goal is to convert this sentence into a sequence of bits with the least possible length such that the original sequence can be reconstructed from the sequence of bits. This sentence can first be split into a sequence of words (tokens)

′My′, ′first′, ′attempt′, ′at′, ′writing′, ′a′, ′book′

A language model with memory M (for example, say M = 4) predicts the next word in the sentence based on observing the past M words. Specifically, it produces a rank-ordered list of choices for the next word and their probabilities. As shown in Figure 1, at epoch 5, the model accepts the first 4 words as input and predicts that the next word in the sentence could be words such as ′reading′,′ writing′,′ driving′,′ cooking′ etc. The main idea is to compute the rank of the actual word in our sentence (′writing′) in this list and call it R5. We will assume that the ranks start at 0 i.e., the most likely word has rank 0, the second most likely word has rank 1, and so on. In this example, the rank for ′writing′ is R5 = 1.

**Fig. 1.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 5 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| reading  | 0.3        |
| writing  | 0.2        |
| cycling  | 0.1        |
| driving  | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R5 = 1

Then, we move forward by one word in the sentence, and at epoch 6, we try to predict the 6th word based on words 2 through 5 as shown in Figure 2. In this example, given words 2 through 5, the most likely 6th word would indeed be the same word in the sentence that we wish to encode, ′a′, and hence, the rank R6 would be 0.

**Fig. 2.** Schematic showing the prediction at epoch 6 for a language model with memory 4.

| Next word | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| a        | 0.7        |
| an       | 0.2        |
| the      | 0.05       |
| ...      | ...        |

R6 = 0

If the language model is good, the word that we wish to encode would often appear at the top of the list and hence, the rank would be 0. Thus, if we look at the sequence of ranks, it is likely to have many 0s with decreasing probabilities for the rank being 1, 2, . . .. In this example, it is foreseeable that the ranks will be

1, 0, 0, . . .

A sequence with many ‘0’s is typically compressible since it has structured patterns. Thus, the key idea is to compress the ranks using a standard lossless compression algorithm such as zip, arithmetic coding, or Huffman coding which converts the ranks to bits. This is shown in Fig. 3.

**Fig. 3.** Schematic showing the compression of the sequence of ranks to a bit sequence.

When we wish to reconstruct the sequence, we first decompress and unzip the bits to get the ranks, use the same language model one epoch at a time to produce a rank ordered list of possibilities for the next word, and pick the word in the list at rank Ri during the ith epoch. We use that as input for determining the next word and so on. Note that this requires that the same LLM is used at both the encoder and the decoder.

The idea of encoding ranks was discussed to build intuition, but better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3.

## III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS

Let s denote a sentence from the English language composed of Nc letters, where each letter is assumed to be from the alphabet S. We assume that we have a dictionary X = [1, D] of D tokens. We first parse s into a sequence of NT tokens denoted by x = x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi, xi+1, . . . xNT , where xi ∈X. There is a one-to-one mapping between s and x and hence, compressing s is the same as compressing x. xi’s can be thought of as realizations of the random variable denoted by the upper case letter Xi.

A language model with memory M is a predictor that operates as follows. At epoch i, it accepts tokens xi−M

Reasoning Plan:
1. Understand the Task: The goal is to act as a deterministic research agent and predict the likely future content of the provided document based on its prefix. This involves identifying facts, equations, definitions, datasets, and references that are logically expected to appear later in the document. The output must be a concise textual synopsis, maximize relevance, and avoid hallucination, relying only on content supported by the tools (or logical inference from the provided text, as the tools are not for internal document prediction).

2. Key Steps:
    a. Analyze the Document Prefix: Carefully read the provided text to identify the core topic (entropy estimation and lossless compression using LLaMA-7B), the problem addressed, the proposed solution, preliminary results, and the document's structural cues (section headings, explicit mentions of future sections).
    b. Identify Explicit and Implicit Cues for Future Content:
        - The Abstract and Introduction state the main goal: new estimates of English entropy using LLaMA-7B and a new lossless compression algorithm.
        - Section "II. INTUITIVE EXPLANATION OF THE MAIN IDEA" describes the high-level concept of using LLMs to predict tokens and compress ranks. It explicitly mentions that "better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3."
        - The heading "III. COMPRESSION USING LLMS" clearly indicates the next major section. The text within this section's prefix begins to formalize the process, introducing concepts like sentence 's', number of letters 'Nc', alphabet 'S', dictionary 'X', number of tokens 'NT', and tokens 'x'. It also mentions a "language model with memory M."
        - References to specific datasets (text8, text from [7]) and comparative compression schemes (BSC, ZPAQ, paq8h) suggest detailed experimental results and comparisons will follow.
        - References [1]-[7] indicate a bibliography will be present.
    c. Synthesize Synopsis: Combine these cues into a concise textual synopsis of the likely future content.

3. Approach Challenges:
    a. Avoiding Hallucination: Strictly adhere to information either directly stated as forthcoming or strongly implied by the document's structure and stated goals. Do not invent content.
    b. Maximizing Relevance: Focus on the core contributions, methodologies, and results. Prioritize details related to the compression algorithm, entropy estimation, and experimental validation.
    c. Conciseness: Extract the essential information without unnecessary verbosity.

4. Strategic Use of Tools:
    The task requires predicting content *later in the same document* based on the provided prefix. The available `default_api` tools are primarily designed for retrieving or summarizing *external* information (e.g., other papers, Wikipedia articles) or for interacting with *existing* documents (e.g., `get_sections`, `get_summary` on an already downloaded paper). They are not designed for *predicting* the future content of a document based on its partial text.
    Therefore, for this specific task, the most effective "tool" is my analytical capability to infer the logical progression and detailed content based on the explicit and implicit cues within the provided document prefix. I will use the structure (section headings), stated goals, and examples provided in the prefix to deduce what information is highly likely to appear next. I will not be calling any `default_api` functions for this task, as they do not directly facilitate the prediction of *internal* document content from a prefix.

5. Expected Outcome: A concise textual synopsis detailing the likely future content. This will include:
    - A detailed explanation of the compression methodology using LLMs, specifically focusing on how probabilities from the LLM are combined with arithmetic coding (Section III-B3).
    - Formal definitions and mathematical formulations related to entropy estimation and the compression scheme.
    - Detailed experimental setup, including the specific use of the LLaMA-7B model, the text8 dataset, and the 100KB text from [7].
    - Comprehensive results comparing the proposed LLaMA-7B based compression scheme with state-of-the-art algorithms like BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h, likely including tables and figures.
    - A discussion of the implications of the new entropy estimates for the English language.
    - A conclusion section summarizing findings and potentially outlining future work.
    - A complete list of references.
This outcome aligns with the goal of providing a comprehensive and accurate response to the task by predicting the document's future content based on the provided prefix.[00m

The available tools are for external information retrieval or interacting with already downloaded papers, not for predicting the internal structure of a partial document. Therefore, I will rely on careful analysis of the provided text.

Here's a breakdown of what the prefix strongly suggests will come next:

1.  **Continuation of Section III: COMPRESSION USING LLMS**:
    *   **Formal Definitions and Equations**: The section has just started introducing formal notation (s, Nc, S, X, D, NT, x, Xi, M). It will likely continue with precise definitions of these terms and mathematical formulations for the language model's prediction process.
    *   **Detailed Algorithm for Entropy Estimation**: The abstract and introduction mention "new estimates of an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy of English." This section will detail the mathematical method for calculating this entropy bound using the LLaMA-7B model's predictions.
    *   **Detailed Algorithm for Lossless Compression (Section III-B3)**: The text explicitly states, "better compression can be achieved by directly using the probabilities produced by the LLM along with arithmetic coding as discussed in Section III-B3." This subsection will provide the core algorithm for the proposed compression scheme, detailing how LLaMA-7B's token probabilities are integrated with an arithmetic coder. This will involve specific steps, potentially pseudocode, and relevant equations for probability encoding.
    *   **Tokenization Strategy**: Given the mention of "tokens" and a "dictionary X," the paper will likely elaborate on the tokenization process used for English text, including how the dictionary is constructed and how variable-length tokens are handled.

2.  **Experimental Setup and Results**:
    *   **Specifics of LLaMA-7B Implementation**: Details on how LLaMA-7B was used (e.g., pre-trained model, fine-tuning, specific parameters, window size for past tokens).
    *   **Dataset Descriptions**: A more thorough description of the `text8` dataset and the "100 KB section of text from [7]," including their characteristics, size, and any preprocessing steps.
    *   **Comparison Baselines**: Detailed information on the state-of-the-art text compression schemes (BSC, ZPAQ, paq8h) used for comparison, including their configurations or versions.
    *   **Quantitative Results**: Tables and figures presenting the measured entropy estimates and compression ratios. These will show the performance of the LLaMA-7B based scheme against the baselines on the specified datasets, substantiating the claims made in the abstract and introduction.
    *   **Analysis and Discussion**: An in-depth analysis of the results, explaining why the LLaMA-7B approach achieves superior performance and the implications of the new entropy estimates.

3.  **Conclusion and Future Work**:
    *   A summary of the paper's contributions and key findings.
    *   Potential limitations of the current study.
    *   Suggestions for future research directions, such as exploring other large language models, different languages, or larger datasets.

4.  **References**:
    *   A complete bibliography listing all cited works, including [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], and [7], along with any other sources introduced later in the paper.

I will now formulate the synopsis based on these points.The document will continue with a detailed exposition of the compression methodology using Large Language Models (LLMs). Section III, "COMPRESSION USING LLMS," will formalize the process, including:

*   **Definitions and Equations**: Precise mathematical definitions for sentence structure, alphabet, token dictionary, and the role of a language model with memory M. This will likely involve equations describing the probabilistic prediction of tokens.
*   **Entropy Estimation Methodology**: A detailed explanation of how the asymptotic upper bound on the entropy of English is estimated using the LLaMA-7B model's predictions, building upon Shannon's principles.
*   **Lossless Compression Algorithm (Section III-B3)**: A comprehensive description of the proposed lossless compression scheme. This will detail how the probabilities generated by the LLaMA-7B model for predicting the next token are directly integrated with an arithmetic coding algorithm to achieve high compression ratios. This section will likely include algorithmic steps, pseudocode, or flowcharts.
*   **Tokenization**: Further details on the tokenization process, including the construction and characteristics of the token dictionary X.

Following the methodology, the document will present:

*   **Experimental Setup**: Specifics regarding the implementation of LLaMA-7B, the exact versions and configurations of baseline compression schemes (BSC, ZPAQ, paq8h), and detailed descriptions of the `text8` dataset and the 100 KB text section from reference [7] used for evaluation.
*   **Results and Discussion**: Quantitative results presented in tables and figures, comparing the entropy estimates and compression ratios achieved by the LLaMA-7B based method against previous estimates and state-of-the-art compressors. This will include an analysis of the performance gains and the implications of the new, lower entropy bounds for English.

Finally, the paper will conclude with:

*   **Conclusion**: A summary of the main findings, contributions, and the significance of using LLMs for entropy estimation and text compression.
*   **Future Work**: Potential directions for further research, such as exploring other LLMs, larger datasets, or different languages.
*   **References**: A complete bibliography listing all cited works, including [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], and [7].[00m
