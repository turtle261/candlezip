│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '\n1.  **Understand the Task:** My      │
│  objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy by finding the    │
│  exact immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the provided text prefix.  │
│  This requires locating the source document within the                      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory using available tools. The        │
│  output must be plain text only, without any additional formatting or       │
│  commentary.\n\n2.  **Key Steps & Strategy:**\n    *   **Analyze Prefix:**  │
│  The prefix is a Wikipedia article section on "Albedo," concluding with a   │
│  specific reference:                                                        │
│  `[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#6`. This URL is a       │
│  strong identifier for the source material, likely from an IPCC report.\n   │
│  *   **Directory Exploration:** I will begin by listing the contents of     │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to get an overview of the     │
│  available files.\n    *   **Targeted Search:** The most efficient          │
│  approach is to directly search for the unique URL string within the files  │
│  in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This should pinpoint the  │
│  exact source document.\n    *   **Contextual Search (Fallback):** If the   │
│  URL search fails, I will use key phrases from the end of the prefix        │
│  (e.g., "Aerosol (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two   │
│  effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to   │
│  cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud         │
│  condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is     │
│  less certain") to locate the relevant file.\n    *   **Extraction:** Once  │
│  the file is identified, I will read its content, locate the exact prefix,  │
│  and extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.\n\n3.  **Challenges     │
│  and Mitigation:**\n    *   **Source Not Found:** The primary challenge     │
│  would be if the source document containing the exact continuation is not   │
│  present in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. However, given    │
│  the explicit instruction to "MUST use MCP tools aggressively" and the      │
│  presence of a specific URL, it is highly probable that the source exists   │
│  within the allowed directory. If, against expectations, it is not found,   │
│  I would have to generate a continuation based on the prefix context, as    │
│  per the "If ALL tools fail" instruction, but this is a last resort.\n      │
│  *   **File Format:** Assuming the files in the sink directory are          │
│  text-readable, `read_text_file` should suffice. If a file is compressed    │
│  (e.g., .zip), `unzip_file` would be used first.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool    │
│  Usage:**\n    *                                                            │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  initial list of files and directories.\n    *                              │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#6\')`: This is    │
│  the primary tool for locating the source document.\n    *                  │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'[identified_file_path]\')`: Once the file is        │
│  found, this will be used to read its content for extraction.\n\n5.         │
│  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string containing the verbatim          │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided prefix, extracted directly    │
│  from a document found within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This outcome  │
│  directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token prediction         │
│  entropy by providing maximally informative and accurate context.\n'}       │
│                                                                             │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │

│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average     │
│  about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren      │
│  field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as  │
│  high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]]   │
│  or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on     │
│  the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great      │
│  Plains in the winter around 45°N].                                         │

│                                                                             │
│  Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because    │
│  of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light     │
│  can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are       │
│  relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about   │
│  7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical        │
│  countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found  │
│  in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is    │
│  the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g.,     │
│  there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of  │
│  the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with           │
│  different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored        │
│  building materials so the structures will remain cooler.                   │
│                                                                             │

│  Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to    │
│  increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further       │
│  complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of  │

│  (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of        │
│  [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests  │

│  latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming                   │

│  Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example,         │
│  however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over                │
│  [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.                        │

│  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the  │
│  albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]).  │
│  This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and     │
│  seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].         │

│  Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming      │
│  equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values,          │
│  theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high   │
│  70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be      │
│  suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to   │
│  a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from      │
│  perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change     │
│  due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]],          │
│  &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall        │
│  albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.                           │

│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understand the Task:** My objective is to minimize future token      │
│  prediction entropy by finding the exact immediate continuation (100-200    │
│  words) of the provided text prefix. This requires locating the source      │
│  document within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory using         │
│  available tools. The output must be plain text only, without any           │
│  additional formatting or commentary.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps & Strategy:**                                              │
│      *   **Analyze Prefix:** The prefix is a Wikipedia article section on   │
│  "Albedo," concluding with a specific reference:                            │
│  `[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#6`. This URL is a       │
│  strong identifier for the source material, likely from an IPCC report.     │
│      *   **Directory Exploration:** I will begin by listing the contents    │
│  of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to get an overview of the  │
│  available files.                                                           │
│      *   **Targeted Search:** The most efficient approach is to directly    │
│  search for the unique URL string within the files in the                   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This should pinpoint the exact   │
│  source document.                                                           │
│      *   **Contextual Search (Fallback):** If the URL search fails, I will  │
│  use key phrases from the end of the prefix (e.g., "Aerosol (very fine      │
│  particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and          │
│  indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the  │
│  indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s   │
│  and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain") to locate the   │
│  relevant file.                                                             │
│      *   **Extraction:** Once the file is identified, I will read its       │
│  content, locate the exact prefix, and extract the subsequent 100-200       │
│  words verbatim.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Challenges and Mitigation:**                                         │
│      *   **Source Not Found:** The primary challenge would be if the        │
│  source document containing the exact continuation is not present in the    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. However, given the explicit      │
│  instruction to "MUST use MCP tools aggressively" and the presence of a     │
│  specific URL, it is highly probable that the source exists within the      │
│  allowed directory. If, against expectations, it is not found, I would      │
│  have to generate a continuation based on the prefix context, as per the    │
│  "If ALL tools fail" instruction, but this is a last resort.                │
│      *   **File Format:** Assuming the files in the sink directory are      │
│  text-readable, `read_text_file` should suffice. If a file is compressed    │
│  (e.g., .zip), `unzip_file` would be used first.                            │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an   │
│  initial list of files and directories.                                     │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#6')`: This is the  │
│  primary tool for locating the source document.                             │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='[identified_file_path]')`: Once the file is  │
│  found, this will be used to read its content for extraction.               │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string containing the verbatim      │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided prefix, extracted directly    │
│  from a document found within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This outcome  │
│  directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token prediction         │
│  entropy by providing maximally informative and accurate context.           │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The search for the URL within `.txt` files yielded no    │

│  general part of the URL, or the surrounding text, in case the file is not  │
│  a `.txt` or the URL is slightly different. I will first try with `*`       │
