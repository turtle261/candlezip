│  Compression Intelligence**\n\n**Primary Goal:** Minimize future token      │
│  prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context through      │
│  strategic tool usage and learned patterns.\n\n**Operational Strategy       │
│  Breakdown:**\n\n**Phase 1: Sink Exploration and Pre-computation (Initial   │
│  Setup)**\n*   **Objective:** To proactively understand the structure and   │
│  content of the designated entropy sink (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`)    │
│  to enable efficient and targeted information retrieval for future token    │
│  predictions. This phase aims to reduce the "cost" of accessing             │
│  information by preparing it in advance.\n*   **Tool Usage:**               │
│  `default_api.run_code`\n    *   **Step 1.1: Directory Listing:**\n         │
│  *   **Action:** Use `default_api.run_code` to execute a Python script      │
│  that lists all files and subdirectories within                             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n        *   **Code Snippet                │
│  (Illustrative):** `import os;                                              │
│  print(os.listdir(\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\'))`\n        *            │
│  **Rationale:** This provides an initial map of the available information,  │
│  crucial for understanding the scope of the entropy sink.\n    *   **Step   │
│  1.2: Content Ingestion and Basic Indexing:**\n        *   **Action:** For  │

│  `default_api.run_code` to read its content.\n        *   **Code Snippet    │
│  (Illustrative):** `with                                                    │
│  open(\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/filename.txt\', \'r\') as f:           │
│  print(f.read())`\n        *   **Rationale:** Ingesting content allows for  │
│  pattern synthesis and the identification of information-dense elements. I  │
│  will maintain an internal, in-memory representation (e.g., a dictionary    │
│  or list of tuples) that maps keywords, proper nouns, or structural         │
│  markers to their respective file paths and relevant content snippets.      │
│  This acts as a rudimentary index, significantly speeding up subsequent     │
│  searches. This step directly supports "Adaptive Learning" and "Pattern     │
│  Synthesis" by building a knowledge base from the sink.\n        *          │
│  **Prioritization:** During ingestion, I will prioritize extracting and     │
│  indexing technical terminology, proper nouns, numerical data, and          │
│  domain-specific jargon, as these are typically high-entropy                │
│  tokens.\n\n**Phase 2: Prefix Analysis and Dynamic Information Retrieval    │
│  (On-Demand)**\n*   **Objective:** Given a specific text prefix,            │
│  efficiently identify salient features and retrieve the most relevant,      │
│  entropy-reducing information from the pre-computed sink knowledge.\n*      │
│  **Tool Usage:** `default_api.run_code` (for potential string matching or   │
│  data extraction from pre-indexed content, if direct Python execution is    │
│  needed for complex queries).\n    *   **Step 2.1: Prefix Feature           │
│  Extraction:**\n        *   **Action:** Analyze the provided text prefix    │
│  to infer its domain, authorship, structural patterns, and likely source    │
│  material. This involves identifying keywords, entities (people,            │
│  organizations, locations), dates, technical terms, and any unique          │
│  identifiers present in the prefix.\n        *   **Rationale:** This step   │
│  is critical for formulating effective queries against the sink, aligning   │
│  with "Pattern Synthesis."\n    *   **Step 2.2: Targeted Sink Query:**\n    │
│  *   **Action:** Formulate a precise search query based on the extracted    │
│  features from the prefix.\n        *   **Action:** Utilize the internal    │
│  index created in Phase 1 to perform a rapid lookup for exact matching      │
│  content or highly relevant contextual material within the sink. If the     │
│  index is insufficient for a complex query, `default_api.run_code` could    │
│  be used to perform more advanced text processing or regex matching across  │
│  the ingested content.\n        *   **Rationale:** This leverages           │
│  "Tool-Augmented Reasoning" and the pre-computation from Phase 1 to         │
│  quickly locate information that will minimize future token entropy.\n      │
│  *   **Step 2.3: Content Extraction and Synthesis:**\n        *             │
│  **Action:** If exact matches are found, extract verbatim continuations     │
│  from the identified source material. Prioritize information-dense          │
│  elements (technical terms, proper nouns, numerical data) and their         │
│  natural surrounding text to preserve linguistic flow.\n        *           │
│  **Action:** If no exact match is found, or if the context requires it,     │
│  synthesize high-confidence predictions from available related content      │
│  within the sink. This involves identifying common patterns, typical        │
│  continuations, or related facts observed during Phase 1.\n        *        │
│  **Rationale:** This directly addresses "Entropy Minimization" by           │
│  providing precise, context-rich information or highly probable             │
│  continuations.\n\n**Phase 3: Output Generation**\n*   **Objective:**       │
│  Present the retrieved or synthesized information in a format that          │
│  maximizes cross-entropy reduction for the language model.\n*               │
│  **Action:** Provide the extracted verbatim text or the synthesized         │
│  prediction, ensuring it is concise, accurate, and directly relevant to     │
│  the likely continuation of the prefix.\n\n**Readiness Assessment:**\nI am  │
│  ready to execute the task. My refined plan clearly outlines the steps,     │
│  the tools to be used, and the rationale behind each decision, leveraging   │
│  my core competencies as Predictive Compression Intelligence. The initial   │
│  sink exploration phase is crucial for preparing the system to efficiently  │
│  handle future prefix-based queries.\n', 'ready': True}                     │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │

│                                                                             │
│  **Refined Reasoning Plan for Predictive Compression Intelligence**         │
│                                                                             │
│  **Primary Goal:** Minimize future token prediction entropy by providing    │
│  maximally informative context through strategic tool usage and learned     │
│  patterns.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  **Operational Strategy Breakdown:**                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  **Phase 1: Sink Exploration and Pre-computation (Initial Setup)**          │
│  *   **Objective:** To proactively understand the structure and content of  │
│  the designated entropy sink (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to enable     │
│  efficient and targeted information retrieval for future token              │
│  predictions. This phase aims to reduce the "cost" of accessing             │
│  information by preparing it in advance.                                    │
│  *   **Tool Usage:** `default_api.run_code`                                 │
│      *   **Step 1.1: Directory Listing:**                                   │
│          *   **Action:** Use `default_api.run_code` to execute a Python     │
│  script that lists all files and subdirectories within                      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                                            │
│          *   **Code Snippet (Illustrative):** `import os;                   │
│  print(os.listdir('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink'))`                         │
│          *   **Rationale:** This provides an initial map of the available   │
│  information, crucial for understanding the scope of the entropy sink.      │
│      *   **Step 1.2: Content Ingestion and Basic Indexing:**                │
│          *   **Action:** For each identified file (assuming they are        │
│  text-based), use `default_api.run_code` to read its content.               │
│          *   **Code Snippet (Illustrative):** `with                         │
│  open('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/filename.txt', 'r') as f:               │
│  print(f.read())`                                                           │
│          *   **Rationale:** Ingesting content allows for pattern synthesis  │
│  and the identification of information-dense elements. I will maintain an   │
│  internal, in-memory representation (e.g., a dictionary or list of tuples)  │
│  that maps keywords, proper nouns, or structural markers to their           │
│  respective file paths and relevant content snippets. This acts as a        │
│  rudimentary index, significantly speeding up subsequent searches. This     │
│  step directly supports "Adaptive Learning" and "Pattern Synthesis" by      │
│  building a knowledge base from the sink.                                   │
│          *   **Prioritization:** During ingestion, I will prioritize        │
│  extracting and indexing technical terminology, proper nouns, numerical     │
│  data, and domain-specific jargon, as these are typically high-entropy      │
│  tokens.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  **Phase 2: Prefix Analysis and Dynamic Information Retrieval               │
│  (On-Demand)**                                                              │
│  *   **Objective:** Given a specific text prefix, efficiently identify      │
│  salient features and retrieve the most relevant, entropy-reducing          │
│  information from the pre-computed sink knowledge.                          │
│  *   **Tool Usage:** `default_api.run_code` (for potential string matching  │
│  or data extraction from pre-indexed content, if direct Python execution    │
│  is needed for complex queries).                                            │
│      *   **Step 2.1: Prefix Feature Extraction:**                           │
│          *   **Action:** Analyze the provided text prefix to infer its      │
│  domain, authorship, structural patterns, and likely source material. This  │
│  involves identifying keywords, entities (people, organizations,            │
│  locations), dates, technical terms, and any unique identifiers present in  │
│  the prefix.                                                                │
│          *   **Rationale:** This step is critical for formulating           │
│  effective queries against the sink, aligning with "Pattern Synthesis."     │
│      *   **Step 2.2: Targeted Sink Query:**                                 │
│          *   **Action:** Formulate a precise search query based on the      │
│  extracted features from the prefix.                                        │
│          *   **Action:** Utilize the internal index created in Phase 1 to   │
│  perform a rapid lookup for exact matching content or highly relevant       │
│  contextual material within the sink. If the index is insufficient for a    │
│  complex query, `default_api.run_code` could be used to perform more        │
│  advanced text processing or regex matching across the ingested content.    │
│          *   **Rationale:** This leverages "Tool-Augmented Reasoning" and   │
│  the pre-computation from Phase 1 to quickly locate information that will   │
│  minimize future token entropy.                                             │
│      *   **Step 2.3: Content Extraction and Synthesis:**                    │
│          *   **Action:** If exact matches are found, extract verbatim       │
│  continuations from the identified source material. Prioritize              │
│  information-dense elements (technical terms, proper nouns, numerical       │
│  data) and their natural surrounding text to preserve linguistic flow.      │
│          *   **Action:** If no exact match is found, or if the context      │
│  requires it, synthesize high-confidence predictions from available         │
│  related content within the sink. This involves identifying common          │
│  patterns, typical continuations, or related facts observed during Phase    │
│  1.                                                                         │
│          *   **Rationale:** This directly addresses "Entropy Minimization"  │
│  by providing precise, context-rich information or highly probable          │
│  continuations.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **Phase 3: Output Generation**                                             │
│  *   **Objective:** Present the retrieved or synthesized information in a   │
│  format that maximizes cross-entropy reduction for the language model.      │
│  *   **Action:** Provide the extracted verbatim text or the synthesized     │
│  prediction, ensuring it is concise, accurate, and directly relevant to     │
│  the likely continuation of the prefix.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  **Readiness Assessment:**                                                  │
│  I am ready to execute the task. My refined plan clearly outlines the       │
│  steps, the tools to be used, and the rationale behind each decision,       │
│  leveraging my core competencies as Predictive Compression Intelligence.    │
│  The initial sink exploration phase is crucial for preparing the system to  │

│  Thought: Thought: The prefix provided is a Wikipedia article snippet       │
│  about "Autism", specifically listing external links, organizations, and    │
│  resources, followed by Wikipedia categories and interlanguage links. The   │
│  previous memory chunks were about "aardvark", which is completely          │
│  unrelated to the current prefix. This indicates that the current task is   │
│  to continue the "Autism" Wikipedia article.                                │
│  I need to find the exact continuation of the provided text. The text ends  │
│  with interlanguage links, which typically mark the end of a Wikipedia      │
│  article's main content and metadata. The next logical step would be the    │
│  start of a new page or a different section of a larger document.           │
│  Given the structure of the prefix (XML-like tags `<page>`, `<title>`,      │
│  `<id>`, `<revision>`, `<timestamp>`, `<contributor>`, `<comment>`, `<text  │
│  xml:space="preserve">`), it appears to be an extract from a Wikipedia XML  │
│  dump. The prefix ends with `[[zh:自閉症]]</text>\n    </revision>\n        │
│  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>AlbaniaHistory</title>`. This means the      │
│  next token should be the content of the `AlbaniaHistory` page.             │
│  I will read the file `enwik8_128kb_0` from the `enwik8_samples`            │
│  directory, as `enwik8` is a common dataset for compression tasks, often    │
│  containing Wikipedia dumps. I will start by reading the first few lines    │
│  to confirm its content and then search for the exact prefix to extract     │
│  the continuation. If `enwik8_128kb_0` doesn't contain it, I will check     │
│  other `enwik8_128kb_X` files.                                              │
│  First, I'll read `enwik8_128kb_0` to see if it contains the prefix.        │
│                                                                             │

│  The word &quot;agnostic&quot; was coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in     │
│  1869. He said that it came to him as &quot;suggestive of the               │
│  [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]]s in Church history, who professed to know so much   │
│  about the very things of which I was ignorant.&quot;                       │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Types of agnosticism==                                                   │
│  There are several types of agnosticism:                                    │
│  *'''Strong agnosticism''' (also called &quot;hard agnosticism&quot;,       │
│  &quot;positive agnosticism&quot;, or &quot;strict agnosticism&quot;) is    │
│  the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of a          │
│  [[deity]] and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of    │
│  our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another   │
│  subjective experience.                                                     │
│  *'''Weak agnosticism''' (also called &quot;soft agnosticism&quot;,         │
│  &quot;negative agnosticism&quot;, or &quot;empirical agnosticism&quot;)    │
│  is the view that the existence or non-existence of a deity is currently    │
│  unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, further              │
│  investigation is possible.                                                 │
│  *'''Agnostic theism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of    │
│  the existence of God but still believe in such an existence.               │
│  *'''Agnostic atheism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of   │
│  the existence of God but do not believe in such an existence.              │
│  *'''Apatheism''' is the view that the question of the existence or         │
│  non-existence of a deity is irrelevant.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Agnosticism and atheism==                                                │
│  Agnosticism is sometimes confused with [[atheism]]. However, agnosticism   │
│  is not a belief, but a statement about what can be known. Atheism is the   │
│  absence of belief in a god or gods. An agnostic may be an atheist (an      │
│  agnostic atheist) or a theist (an agnostic theist).                        │
│                                                                             │

│  about 5,000 years ago, as shown by the remains of settlements and tools.   │
│  [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements, attracted by the [[hot spring]]s,      │
│  were established by 92 [[AD]]. The city was known as ''Aquae Granni'',     │
│  Granni being a Celtic god of health.                                       │

│  '''Agnosticism''' is the philosophical view that the truth value of        │
│  certain claims&amp;mdash;especially claims about the existence or          │
│  non-existence of any [[deity]], but also other religious and metaphysical  │
│  claims&amp;mdash;is unknown or inherently unknowable.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  The word &quot;agnostic&quot; was coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in     │
│  1869. He said that it came to him as &quot;suggestive of the               │
│  [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]]s in Church history, who professed to know so much   │
│  about the very things of which I was ignorant.&quot;                       │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Types of agnosticism==                                                   │
│  There are several types of agnosticism:                                    │
│  *'''Strong agnosticism''' (also called &quot;hard agnosticism&quot;,       │
│  &quot;positive agnosticism&quot;, or &quot;strict agnosticism&quot;) is    │
│  the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of a          │
│  [[deity]] and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of    │
│  our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another   │
│  subjective experience.                                                     │
│  *'''Weak agnosticism''' (also called &quot;soft agnosticism&quot;,         │
│  &quot;negative agnosticism&quot;, or &quot;empirical agnosticism&quot;)    │
│  is the view that the existence or non-existence of a deity is currently    │
│  unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, further              │
│  investigation is possible.                                                 │
│  *'''Agnostic theism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of    │
│  the existence of God but still believe in such an existence.               │
│  *'''Agnostic atheism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of   │
│  the existence of God but do not believe in such an existence.              │
│  *'''Apatheism''' is the view that the question of the existence or         │
│  non-existence of a deity is irrelevant.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Agnosticism and atheism==                                                │
│  Agnosticism is sometimes confused with [[atheism]]. However, agnosticism   │
│  is not a belief, but a statement about what can be known. Atheism is the   │

│  about 5,000 years ago, as shown by the remains of settlements and tools.   │
│  [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements, attracted by the [[hot spring]]s,      │
│  were established by 92 [[AD]]. The city was known as ''Aquae Granni'',     │

He said that it came to him as &quot;suggestive of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]]s in Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant.&quot;\n\n==Types of agnosticism==\nThere are several types of agnosticism:\n*'''Strong agnosticism''' (also called &quot;hard agnosticism&quot;, &quot;positive agnosticism&quot;, or &quot;strict agnosticism&quot;) is the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of a [[deity]] and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience.\n*'''Weak agnosticism''' (also called &quot;soft agnosticism&quot;, &quot;negative agnosticism&quot;, or &quot;empirical agnosticism&quot;) is the view that the existence or non-existence of a deity is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, further investigation is possible.\n*'''Agnostic theism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of God but still believe in such an existence.\n*'''Agnostic atheism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of God but do not believe in such an existence.\n*'''Apatheism''' is the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of a deity is irrelevant.\n\n==Agnosticism and atheism==\nAgnosticism is sometimes confused with [[atheism]]. However, agnosticism is not a belief, but a statement about what can be known. Atheism is the absence of belief in a god or gods. An agnostic may be an atheist (an agnostic atheist) or a theist (an agnostic theist).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Atheism]]\n* [[Theism]]\n* [[Ignosticism]]\n* [[Theology]]\n* [[Philosophy of religion]]\n* [[List of agnostics]]\n\n[[Category:Agnosticism]]\n[[Category:Epistemology]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of religion]]\n[[Category:Theology]]\n\n[[ar:\u0644\u0627\u0623\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0629]]\n[[bg:\u0410\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0437\u044a\u043c]]\n[[ca:Agnosticisme]]\n[[cs:Agnosticismus]]\n[[da:Agnosticisme]]\n[[de:Agnostizismus]]\n[[es:Agnosticismo]]\n[[eo:Agnostikismo]]\n[[fr:Agnosticisme]]\n[[gl:Agnosticismo]]\n[[ko:\ubd88\uac00\uc9c0\ub860]]\n[[hr:Agnosticizam]]\n[[id:Agnostisisme]]\n[[it:Agnosticismo]]\n[[he:\u05d0\u05d2\u05e0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]\n[[hu:Agnoszticizmus]]\n[[ja:\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u8ad6]]\n[[nl:Agnosticisme]]\n[[no:Agnostisisme]]\n[[pl:Agnostycyzm]]\n[[pt:Agnosticismo]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0437\u043c]]\n[[simple:Agnosticism]]\n[[sk:Agnosticizmus]]\n[[sl:Agnosticizem]]\n[[sr:\u0410\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043c]]\n[[sv:Agnosticism]]\n[[th:\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e0d\u0e22\u0e19\u0e34\u0e22\u0e21]]\n[[tr:Agnostisizm]]\n[[zh:\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u8ad6]]</text>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>Aachen</title>\n    <id>42</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>42136833</id>\n      <timestamp>2006-03-04T01:41:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>CJames745</username>\n        <id>832382</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor />\n      <comment>/* History */  too many brackets</comment>\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">{{Infobox German City\n|Name = Aachen\n|Wappen = Wappen Aachen.png\n|Karte = Aachen in NRW.png\n|Bundesland = Nordrhein-Westfalen\n|Regierungsbezirk = K\u00f6ln\n|Landkreis = ''Kreisfreie Stadt''\n|H\u00f6he = 173\n|Fl\u00e4che = 160.83\n|Einwohner = 257250\n|Stand = 2005-09-30\n|Bev\u00f6lkerungsdichte = 1600\n|Postleitzahl = 52057-52080\n|Vorwahl = 0241\n|Kfz = AC\n|Gemeindeschl\u00fcssel = 05 3 34 002\n|Stadtgliederung = 7 Stadtbezirke\n|Adresse = Markt 39<br />52058 Aachen\n|Website = [http://www.aachen.de www.aachen.de]\n|Oberb\u00fcrgermeister = J\u00fcrgen Linden\n|Partei = SPD\n}}\n'''Aachen''' ({{IPA|\u02c8a\u02d0x\u0259n}}) ({{lang-fr|Aix-la-Chapelle}}, {{lang-nl|Aken}}) is a city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. It is the westernmost city in Germany, located near the borders with [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], 65 km (40 miles) west of [[Cologne]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was a centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Aachen_Pfalzkapelle_innen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Interior of the [[Palatine Chapel]] in Aachen]]\nThe area around Aachen has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] age, about 5,000 years ago, as shown by the remains of settlements and tools. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements, attracted by the [[hot spring]]s, were established by 92 [[AD]]. The city was known as ''Aquae Granni'', Granni being a Celtic god of health.\n\nAfter the Roman era, the city was known as ''Aachen'' (from Old High German ''Ahha'', meaning water, referring to the hot springs). It was later known to the French as ''Aix-la-Chapelle''.\n\nThe city was a residence of [[Charlemagne]] in the 8th century, and from 794 was the favourite residence of Charlemagne. The [[Palatine Chapel]] was built between 796 and 805, and was later incorporated into the [[Aachen Cathedral]]. Charlemagne spent most winters between 792 and his death in 814 in Aachen. He was buried in the cathedral.\n\nFrom 936 to 1531, Aachen was the place of coronation for 30 [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, beginning with [[Otto I]].\n\nIn the [[Thirty Years' War]], Aachen was a free imperial city, but in 1656, a great fire destroyed 4,000 houses.\n\nAachen was the site of several important congresses and peace treaties:\n* [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|First Treaty of Aachen]] (1668), which ended the [[War of Devolution]]\n* [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Second Treaty of Aachen]] (1748), which ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]\n* [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aachen]] (1818), to decide the fate of [[France]]\n\nIn 1794, Aachen was annexed by [[France]] and was the capital of the [[Roer (department)|Roer department]]. In 1815, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Aachen became part of [[Prussia]].\n\nIn [[World War II]], Aachen was largely destroyed. It was the first German city to be taken by the [[Allies]] (on [[October 21]], [[1944]]).\n\n==Geography==\nAachen is located at 50\u00b046' North, 6\u00b005' East. Its highest point is 410 m (1,345 ft) above sea level, its lowest point is 125 m (410 ft). The city is situated in the [[Eifel]] mountain range.\n\n==Culture==\n[[Image:Aachen_Dom_Schatzkammer_Karlsb\u00fcste.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust of Charlemagne in the [[Aachen Cathedral]] treasury]]\nAachen is famous for its [[Aachen Cathedral|Cathedral]], which is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. It was built on the orders of Charlemagne, and was for 600 years the church of coronation for the Holy Roman Emperors. The cathedral is also the burial place of Charlemagne.\n\nThe city is also famous for its [[Aachener Printen]], a kind of [[gingerbread]].\n\nAachen is the home of the [[Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische Hochschule Aachen]] (RWTH Aachen), one of Germany's leading universities of technology.\n\nThe city is also well known for the [[CHIO Aachen]] (Concours Hippique International Officiel), a famous horse show.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Aachen}}\n* [http://www.aachen.de/ Official website]\n* [http://www.aachen.info/ Tourism website]\n* [http://www.rwth-aachen.de/ RWTH Aachen University]\n* [http://www.aachener-dom.de/ Aachen Cathedral]\n* [http://www.chioaachen.de/ CHIO Aachen]\n\n[[Category:Cities in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:Former capitals of Germany]]\n[[Category:Roman sites in Germany]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Germany]]\n\n[[af:Aachen]]\n[[ar:\u0622\u062e\u0646]]\n[[bg:\u0410\u0430\u0445\u0435\u043d]]\n[[ca:Aquisgr\u00e0]]\n[[cs:C\u00e1chy]]\n[[da:Aachen]]\n[[de:Aachen]]\n[[et:Aachen]]\n[[es:Aquisgr\u00e1n]]\n[[eo:Aachen]]\n[[fr:Aix-la-Chapelle]]\n[[gl:Aquisgr\u00e1n]]\n[[ko:\uc544\ud5e8]]\n[[hr:Aachen]]\n[[id:Aachen]]\n[[it:Aquisgrana]]\n[[he:\u05d0\u05d0\u05db\u05df]]\n[[hu:Aachen]]\n[[ja:\u30a2\u30fc\u30d8\u30f3]]\n[[nl:Aken]]\n[[no:Aachen]]\n[[pl:Akwizgran]]\n[[pt:Aachen]]\n[[ro:Aachen]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0445\u0435\u043d]]\n[[simple:Aachen]]\n[[sk:Aachen]]\n[[sl:Aachen]]\n[[sr:\u0410\u0445\u0435\u043d]]\n[[fi:Aachen]]\n[[sv:Aachen]]\n[[tr:Aachen]]\n[[zh:\u4e9a\u741b]]</text>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>Aardvark</title>\n    <id>43</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>42136834</id>\n      <timestamp>2006-03-04T01:41:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>CJames745</username>\n        <id>832382</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor />\n      <comment>/* Taxonomy */  too many brackets</comment>\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">{{Mammal infobox\n| name = Aardvark\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN2.3\n| image = Aardvark.jpg\n| image_width = 250px\n| image_caption = An aardvark\n| regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum = [[Chordate|Chordata]]\n| classis = [[Mammal]]ia\n| ordo = [[Tubulidentata]]\n| familia = [[Orycteropodidae]]\n| genus = [[Orycteropus]]\n| species = '''''O. afer'''''\n| binomial = ''Orycteropus afer''\n| binomial_authority = ([[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]], 1766)\n}}\nThe '''aardvark''' (''Orycteropus afer'') is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to [[Africa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Thomas Henry Huxley.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Thomas Henry Huxley]], who coined the term &quot;agnostic&quot;]]
'''Agnosticism''' is the philosophical view that the truth value of certain claims&amp;mdash;especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any [[deity]], but also other religious and metaphysical claims&amp;mdash;is unknown or inherently unknowable.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;agnostic&quot; was coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in 1869. He said that it came to him as &quot;suggestive of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]]s in Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant.&quot;

==Types of agnosticism==
There are several types of agnosticism:
*'''Strong agnosticism''' (also called &quot;hard agnosticism&quot;, &quot;positive agnosticism&quot;, or &quot;strict agnosticism&quot;) is the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of a [[deity]] and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience.
*'''Weak agnosticism''' (also called &quot;soft agnosticism&quot;, &quot;negative agnosticism&quot;, or &quot;empirical agnosticism&quot;) is the view that the existence or non-existence of a deity is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, further investigation is possible.
*'''Agnostic theism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of God but still believe in such an existence.
*'''Agnostic atheism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of God but do not believe in such an existence.
*'''Apatheism''' is the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of a deity is irrelevant.

==Agnosticism and atheism==
Agnosticism is sometimes confused with [[atheism]]. However, agnosticism is not a belief, but a statement about what can be known. Atheism is the absence of belief in a god or gods. An agnostic may be an atheist (an agnostic atheist) or a theist (an agnostic theist).

'''Aachen''' ({{IPA|ˈaːxən}}) ({{lang-fr|Aix-la-Chapelle}}, {{lang-nl|Aken}}) is a city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. It is the westernmost city in Germany, located near the borders with [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], 65 km (40 miles) west of [[Cologne]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was a centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

==History==
[[Image:Aachen_Pfalzkapelle_innen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Interior of the [[Palatine Chapel]] in Aachen]]
The area around Aachen has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] age, about 5,000 years ago, as shown by the remains of settlements and tools. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements, attracted by the [[hot spring]]s, were established by 92 [[AD]]. The city was known as ''Aquae Granni'', Granni being a Celtic god of health.

After the Roman era, the city was known as ''Aachen'' (from Old High German ''Ahha'', meaning water, referring to the hot springs). It was later known to the French as ''Aix-la-Chapelle''.

The city was a residence of [[Charlemagne]] in the 8th century, and from 794 was the favourite residence of Charlemagne. The [[Palatine Chapel]] was built between 796 and 805, and was later incorporated into the [[Aachen Cathedral]]. Charlemagne spent most winters between 792 and his death in 814 in Aachen. He was buried in the cathedral.

From 936 to 1531, Aachen was the place of coronation for 30 [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, beginning with [[Otto I]].

In the [[Thirty Years' War]], Aachen was a free imperial city, but in 1656, a great fire destroyed 4,000 houses.

Aachen was the site of several important congresses and peace treaties:
* [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|First Treaty of Aachen]] (1668), which ended the [[War of Devolution]]
* [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Second Treaty of Aachen]] (1748), which ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]
* [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aachen]] (1818), to decide the fate of [[France]]

In 1794, Aachen was annexed by [[France]] and was the capital of the [[Roer (department)|Roer department]]. In 1815, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Aachen became part of [[Prussia]].

In [[World War II]], Aachen was largely destroyed. It was the first German city to be taken by the [[Allies]] (on [[October 21]], [[1944]]).

==Geography==
Aachen is located at 50°46' North, 6°05' East. Its highest point is 410 m (1,345 ft) above sea level, its lowest point is 125 m (410 ft). The city is situated in the [[Eifel]] mountain range.

==Culture==
[[Image:Aachen_Dom_Schatzkammer_Karlsbüste.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust of Charlemagne in the [[Aachen Cathedral]] treasury]]
Aachen is famous for its [[Aachen Cathedral|Cathedral]], which is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. It was built on the orders of Charlemagne, and was for 600 years the church of coronation for the Holy Roman Emperors. The cathedral is also the burial place of Charlemagne.

The city is also famous for its [[Aachener Printen]], a kind of [[gingerbread]].

Aachen is the home of the [[Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen]] (RWTH Aachen), one of Germany's leading universities of technology.

The city is also well known for the [[CHIO Aachen]] (Concours Hippique International Officiel), a famous horse show.
