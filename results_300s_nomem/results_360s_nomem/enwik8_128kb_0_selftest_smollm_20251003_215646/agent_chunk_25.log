│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │
│  Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a        │
│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │
│  interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see   │

│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │
│  the proprietor of the thing.&quot;                                         │
│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │
│  thought are diverse.                                                       │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │

│  believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces            │
│  [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use          │
│  [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions.  │
│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │
│  [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for     │
│  the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of       │

│  itself.{{fact}}                                                            │

│  Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return  │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │
│  Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy   │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  *'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in   │
│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │
│  revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's        │
│  vision at the point of a                                                   │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │
│  has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle      │
│  criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]                        │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │

│  1. Task Understanding: The primary goal is to minimize future token        │
│  prediction entropy by providing the exact immediate continuation (100-200  │
│  words) of the given prefix. The "Prior memory" section of the prompt       │
│  explicitly provides this continuation. The output must be plain text       │
│  only, without any additional formatting or commentary.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      a. Identify the prefix: "Tucker's conception of individualist          │
│  anarchism incorporated the ideas"                                          │
│      b. Locate the exact continuation in the "Prior memory" section.        │
│      c. Extract the verbatim text of the continuation.                      │
│      d. Ensure the extracted text is between 100 and 200 words.             │
│      e. Output the extracted text as plain text, adhering to all            │
│  formatting constraints.                                                    │

│  3. Challenges and Mitigation:                                              │
│      a. The main challenge would be if the "Prior memory" did not contain   │
│  the exact continuation or if it was ambiguous. However, in this case, the  │
│  continuation is clearly and explicitly provided.                           │
│      b. Ensuring the word count is within the specified range (100-200      │
│  words). I have pre-counted the words and confirmed it is approximately     │
│  112 words, which is within the range.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      a. In this specific scenario, the "Prior memory" has already served    │
│  as the "external information source" (entropy sink) providing the          │
│  maximally informative context (the verbatim continuation). Therefore, no   │
│  further `default_api` tools are required to *find* the continuation. My    │
│  strategic use of tools is to recognize that the information has already    │
│  been provided and to directly utilize it.                                  │
│      b. I will not be using `list_directory`, `read_file_lines`,            │
│  `search_files_content`, or any other file system tools because the         │
│  required information is already present in the prompt's "Prior memory."    │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome: The exact plain text continuation provided in the     │
│  "Prior memory" section, which directly follows the prefix "Tucker's        │
│  conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas". This        │
│  verbatim output will provide the highest possible information density,     │
│  thereby minimizing future token prediction entropy as per the SIMDL        │
│  framework.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
