│  **1. Understanding of the task from my professional perspective:**         │
│  As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my core objective is to minimize   │
│  the information entropy of upcoming token predictions. This task directly  │
│  supports that objective by requiring the retrieval of an exact, verbatim   │
│  continuation of a given text prefix. By providing the precise next         │
│  sequence of tokens, I can drastically reduce the language model's          │
│  uncertainty, leading to maximal compression gains under the SIMDL          │
│  framework. The Wikipedia-like formatting in the prefix (e.g.,              │
│  `[[Link|Text]]`, `{{ref|...}}`, `[[Image:...]]`) is a critical pattern     │
│  signal, indicating that the source material is likely a Wikipedia article  │
│  or a similar encyclopedic text. This allows me to focus my tool-augmented  │
│  reasoning on identifying such documents within the specified entropy       │
│  sink.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key steps to complete it:**                                           │
│  a. **Directory Structure Analysis:** First, I will inspect the             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its contents and    │
│  organization. This initial reconnaissance is crucial for efficient         │
│  searching.                                                                 │
│  b. **Targeted Content Search:** I will use the exact ending of the         │
│  provided prefix as a search query to locate the source document within     │
│  the `sink` directory. The emphasis is on an *exact* match to ensure the    │
│  highest fidelity for prediction.                                           │
│  c. **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the source document is identified, I      │
│  will precisely locate the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent     │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│  d. **Markup Cleaning:** The extracted text will likely contain Wikipedia   │
│  markup. I will apply a series of cleaning operations (regex and string     │
│  replacements) to convert it into plain text, as required by the output     │
│  format.                                                                    │
│  e. **Output Generation:** The cleaned, plain text continuation will be     │
│  presented as the final output.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. How I'll approach any challenges that might arise:**                  │
│  *   **Challenge: Large or complex directory structure.**                   │
│      *   **Approach:** I will use `directory_tree` to quickly map the       │
│  structure. If many files are present, `search_files_content` will be used  │
│  recursively across the entire directory to efficiently pinpoint the        │
│  relevant file(s) without needing to manually inspect each one.             │
│  *   **Challenge: Prefix not found exactly.**                               │
│      *   **Approach:** The task prioritizes finding an exact match. If the  │
│  initial `search_files_content` with the full prefix fails, I will try      │
│  slightly shorter, less specific segments of the prefix, or variations in   │
│  case of minor discrepancies (e.g., encoding issues, subtle formatting      │
│  differences). If, after exhaustive search within the allowed directory,    │
│  no exact match is found, I will then resort to generating a context-based  │
│  continuation as a last resort, but this is highly undesirable for entropy  │
│  minimization.                                                              │
│  *   **Challenge: Incomplete or malformed continuation after extraction.**  │
│      *   **Approach:** I will ensure the extraction logic correctly         │
│  handles the `start_index` and `len(prefix_end_string)` to get the precise  │
│  starting point. The cleaning process will be robust, leveraging the        │
│  provided regex patterns from "Prior memory" to handle common Wikipedia     │
│  markup. I will also ensure the word count is within the 100-200 word       │
│  range.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. How I'll strategically use the available tools:**                     │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the accessible directory  │
│  path, ensuring I operate within the specified boundaries.                  │
│  *   **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To gain a        │
│  comprehensive understanding of the file system structure within the        │
│  `sink` directory. This helps in visualizing where potential source files   │
│  might reside.                                                              │
│  *   **`search_files_content('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', 'Other         │
│  researchers assert that it is actually the medical profession which is     │
│  applying mental disease', ignore_case=False)`**: This is the primary and   │
│  most critical tool. I will use it to perform a recursive, case-sensitive   │
│  search for the exact ending of the prefix within all files in the `sink`   │
│  directory. This directly targets the information needed for entropy        │
│  reduction.                                                                 │
│  *   **`read_text_file(file_path)`**: Once `search_files_content` returns   │
│  a file path, this tool will be used to retrieve the full content of that   │
│  file.                                                                      │
│  *   **Python string manipulation (`.find()`, slicing) and `re` module**:   │
│  These will be used internally to:                                          │
│      *   Locate the exact position of the prefix within the file content.   │
│      *   Extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                              │
│      *   Apply the comprehensive set of regex and string replacement        │
│  operations (as detailed in the "Prior memory" section) to clean Wikipedia  │
│  markup and ensure the output is plain text.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. The expected outcome and how it aligns with my goal:**                │
│  The expected outcome is a block of 100-200 words of plain text,            │
│  representing the exact, immediate continuation of the provided prefix.     │
│  This output will be free of any formatting, lists, headings, or            │
│  meta-text. This outcome perfectly aligns with my goal of minimizing        │
│  future token prediction entropy because providing the verbatim             │
│  continuation from a verified source offers the highest possible            │
│  information density and precision. This allows the language model to       │
│  assign maximum probability mass to the actual subsequent tokens, thereby   │
│  achieving optimal compression and reducing the expected description        │
│  length.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │

│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │

│  more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely,     │
│  instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.     │
│                                                                             │
│  == Types of autism ==                                                      │
│  Autism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly                │
│  [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally       │
│  handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to       │
│  appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms  │
│  of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often         │
│  divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80          │
│  referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while      │
│  those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high-functioning   │
│  autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied    │
│  to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living,       │
│  rather than to [[IQ]].  The terms low and high functioning are             │
│  controversial and not all autistics accept these labels.  Further, these   │
│  two labels are not currently used or accepted in autism literature.        │
│                                                                             │
│  This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate  │
│  IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who    │
│  are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks,   │
│  or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic       │
│  people who are considered LFA. For example, some professionals refuse to   │
│  recognize autistics who can speak or write as being autistic at all,       │
│  because they still think of autism as a communication disorder so severe   │
│  that no speech or writing is possible.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  As a consequence, many &quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic persons, and  │
│  autistic people with a relatively high [[IQ]], are underdiagnosed, thus    │
│  making the claim that &quot;autism implies retardation&quot;               │
│  self-fulfilling. The number of people diagnosed with LFA is not rising     │
│  quite as sharply as HFA, indicating that at least part of the explanation  │
│  for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]   │
│  (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder     │
│  (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former       │
│  includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at   │
│  least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1)     │
│  social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)   │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger's syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot;   │
│  in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the     │
│  fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than      │
│  those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that          │
│  ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning    │
│  autism,&quot; or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There  │
│  is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic    │
│  individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's  │
│  autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label        │
│  attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the    │
│  popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as           │
│  accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of        │
│  family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved  │
│  ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as   │
│  [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory         │
│  Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the        │
│  information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and  │
│  Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.       │
│                                                                             │
│  There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive        │
│  autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is        │
│  present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and    │
│  often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when   │
│  the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe  │
│  that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the       │
│  disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin      │
│  that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The          │
│  triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous   │
│  system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the       │

│  [[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of reported cases  │
│  of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in   │
│  graph from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]].]]                │
│  There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over     │
│  the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the       │
│  diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in    │
│  the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different      │
│  theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is   │
│  partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria,         │
│  reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive          │
│  federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D.      │
│  Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the      │
│  increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are      │
│  accounted for (see reference in this section below).                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including     │
│  Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas    │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, &quot;There is a    │
│  chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can   │
│  answer that question for sure.&quot; ([[Newsweek]] reference below).       │
│                                                                             │
│  The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the           │
│  direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more          │
│  attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors,  │
│  while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to         │
│  genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental  │
│  factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular        │
│  impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little     │
│  public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the        │
│  number of incidences of autism.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between     │
│  &quot;geekdom&quot; and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a        │
│  ''Wired Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled &quot;The [[Geek]]             │
│  Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by many in the autism rights       │
│  movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many professionals assert, is just   │
│  one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what    │
│  is actually variant normal behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness,     │
│  lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests,     │
│  even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of      │
│  autism or Asperger's syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the       │
│  medical profession which is applying mental disease                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  **1. Understanding of the task from my professional perspective:**         │
│  As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my core objective is to minimize   │
│  the information entropy of upcoming token predictions. This task directly  │
│  supports that objective by requiring the retrieval of an exact, verbatim   │
│  continuation of a given text prefix. By providing the precise next         │
│  sequence of tokens, I can drastically reduce the language model's          │
│  uncertainty, leading to maximal compression gains under the SIMDL          │
│  framework. The Wikipedia-like formatting in the prefix (e.g.,              │
│  `[[Link|Text]]`, `{{ref|...}}`, `[[Image:...]]`) is a critical pattern     │
│  signal, indicating that the source material is likely a Wikipedia article  │
│  or a similar encyclopedic text. This allows me to focus my tool-augmented  │
│  reasoning on identifying such documents within the specified entropy       │
│  sink.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key steps to complete it:**                                           │
│  a. **Directory Structure Analysis:** First, I will inspect the             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its contents and    │
│  organization. This initial reconnaissance is crucial for efficient         │
│  searching.                                                                 │
│  b. **Targeted Content Search:** I will use the exact ending of the         │
│  provided prefix as a search query to locate the source document within     │
│  the `sink` directory. The emphasis is on an *exact* match to ensure the    │
│  highest fidelity for prediction.                                           │
│  c. **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the source document is identified, I      │
│  will precisely locate the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent     │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│  d. **Markup Cleaning:** The extracted text will likely contain Wikipedia   │
│  markup. I will apply a series of cleaning operations (regex and string     │
│  replacements) to convert it into plain text, as required by the output     │
│  format.                                                                    │
│  e. **Output Generation:** The cleaned, plain text continuation will be     │
│  presented as the final output.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. How I'll approach any challenges that might arise:**                  │
│  *   **Challenge: Large or complex directory structure.**                   │
│      *   **Approach:** I will use `directory_tree` to quickly map the       │
│  structure. If many files are present, `search_files_content` will be used  │
│  recursively across the entire directory to efficiently pinpoint the        │
│  relevant file(s) without needing to manually inspect each one.             │
│  *   **Challenge: Prefix not found exactly.**                               │
│      *   **Approach:** The task prioritizes finding an exact match. If the  │
│  initial `search_files_content` with the full prefix fails, I will try      │
│  slightly shorter, less specific segments of the prefix, or variations in   │
│  case of minor discrepancies (e.g., encoding issues, subtle formatting      │
│  differences). If, after exhaustive search within the allowed directory,    │
│  no exact match is found, I will then resort to generating a context-based  │
│  continuation as a last resort, but this is highly undesirable for entropy  │
│  minimization.                                                              │
│  *   **Challenge: Incomplete or malformed continuation after extraction.**  │
│      *   **Approach:** I will ensure the extraction logic correctly         │
│  handles the `start_index` and `len(prefix_end_string)` to get the precise  │
│  starting point. The cleaning process will be robust, leveraging the        │
│  provided regex patterns from "Prior memory" to handle common Wikipedia     │
│  markup. I will also ensure the word count is within the 100-200 word       │
│  range.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. How I'll strategically use the available tools:**                     │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the accessible directory  │
│  path, ensuring I operate within the specified boundaries.                  │
│  *   **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To gain a        │
│  comprehensive understanding of the file system structure within the        │
│  `sink` directory. This helps in visualizing where potential source files   │
│  might reside.                                                              │
│  *   **`search_files_content('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', 'Other         │
│  researchers assert that it is actually the medical profession which is     │
│  applying mental disease', ignore_case=False)`**: This is the primary and   │
│  most critical tool. I will use it to perform a recursive, case-sensitive   │
│  search for the exact ending of the prefix within all files in the `sink`   │
│  directory. This directly targets the information needed for entropy        │
│  reduction.                                                                 │
│  *   **`read_text_file(file_path)`**: Once `search_files_content` returns   │
│  a file path, this tool will be used to retrieve the full content of that   │
│  file.                                                                      │
│  *   **Python string manipulation (`.find()`, slicing) and `re` module**:   │
│  These will be used internally to:                                          │
│      *   Locate the exact position of the prefix within the file content.   │
│      *   Extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                              │
│      *   Apply the comprehensive set of regex and string replacement        │
│  operations (as detailed in the "Prior memory" section) to clean Wikipedia  │
│  markup and ensure the output is plain text.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. The expected outcome and how it aligns with my goal:**                │
│  The expected outcome is a block of 100-200 words of plain text,            │
│  representing the exact, immediate continuation of the provided prefix.     │
│  This output will be free of any formatting, lists, headings, or            │
│  meta-text. This outcome perfectly aligns with my goal of minimizing        │
│  future token prediction entropy because providing the verbatim             │
│  continuation from a verified source offers the highest possible            │
│  information density and precision. This allows the language model to       │
│  assign maximum probability mass to the actual subsequent tokens, thereby   │
│  achieving optimal compression and reducing the expected description        │
│  length.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │
