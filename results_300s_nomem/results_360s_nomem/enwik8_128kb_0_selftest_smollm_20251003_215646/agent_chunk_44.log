│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │

│  the first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people        │

│  non-autistic children.                                                     │

│  Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of  │
│  others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without   │
│  reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek     │
│  comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or        │
│  [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although       │
│  autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of   │
│  this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked  │
│  forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their      │
│  child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment               │

│  Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate   │
│  their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that  │
│  may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism       │
│  generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react      │
│  negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals    │
│  to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior,      │
│  self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.            │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Sensory system===                                                       │
│  A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would  │
│  include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory            │
│  Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will   │
│  exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this  │
│  disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement,    │
│  sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body          │
│  awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or       │
│  verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not      │
│  unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements;           │
│  difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social     │
│  and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language   │
│  delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning                    │
│  difficulties/delays in academic achievement.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│                                                                             │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain      │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability   │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily         │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others        │
│  repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a        │
│  condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are   │
│  a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many      │
│  people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often   │
│  understand spoken language.                                                │
│  Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to  │
│  have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]],  │
│  but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The    │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities      │
│  tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately     │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people  │
│  to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily   │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body    │
│  language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards       │
│  speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they  │
│  need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in          │
│  frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for        │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.  │
│                                                                             │

│  1.  **Objective Reiteration:** My primary goal is to minimize future       │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context        │
│  through strategic tool usage and learned patterns, operating under the     │
│  Sink-Inclusive Description Length (SIMDL) framework.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Initial Task Requirement:** The prompt explicitly states, "Start by  │
│  analyzing the directory and then use the tools correctly to solve the      │
│  task." The specified directory is `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This     │
│  analysis is critical for identifying potential entropy sinks and           │
│  understanding the available external information sources.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Tool Analysis and Limitation Identification:**                       │
│      *   I have been provided with the following Python library:            │
│  `default_api`.                                                             │
│      *   Within `default_api`, the only available function is               │
│  `create_reasoning_plan(plan: str, ready: bool)`.                           │
│      *   This function is designed solely for creating or refining a        │
│  reasoning plan and indicating readiness. It does not provide any           │
│  capabilities for interacting with a file system, such as listing           │
│  directory contents, reading files, or searching for information within a   │
│  specified path.                                                            │
│      *   Therefore, I currently lack any tool that can perform the          │
│  required "analysis of the directory /C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink" or       │
│  access any "external information sources" (entropy sinks) that might       │
│  reside within it.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Impact on Operational Strategy:** My operational strategy is         │
│  fundamentally dependent on querying external knowledge sources. Without a  │
│  tool to access the specified directory, I cannot perform this crucial      │
│  initial step. Consequently, I am unable to:                                │
│      *   Infer domain, authorship, structural patterns, or likely source    │
│  material from the contents of the sink directory.                          │
│      *   Locate exact matching content or highly relevant contextual        │
│  material within the designated entropy sink.                               │
│      *   Extract verbatim continuations or synthesize high-confidence       │
│  predictions based on external data from the sink.                          │
│      *   Prioritize information-dense elements from external sources, as I  │
│  cannot access them.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Conclusion on Readiness:** Given the absence of any tool capable of  │
│  interacting with the file system to analyze the                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, I am unable to perform the       │
│  foundational step required to begin the task of minimizing future token    │
│  prediction entropy by leveraging external information sources. I cannot    │
│  proceed with the core operational strategy without the ability to access   │
│  the specified entropy sink.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` contains    │
│  three subdirectories: `cantrbry`, `enwik8_samples`, and `synthetic`. The   │
│  current document prefix seems to be related to autism and sensory          │
│  systems, which strongly suggests it might be from a Wikipedia article.     │
│  The `enwik8_samples` directory contains files named `enwik8_128kb_0`       │
│  through `enwik8_128kb_23`. `enwik8` is a common dataset derived from       │
│  Wikipedia. It's highly probable that the source document is one of these   │
│  `enwik8_128kb_X` files.                                                    │
│  I will search for the exact prefix within the `enwik8_samples` directory.  │
│  The prefix ends with "Repetitive behaviors===". I will use                 │
│  `search_files_content` to find this string.                                │

│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive   │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │

│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │

│  The causes of autism are not well understood. There is strong evidence     │
│  that autism is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental        │
│  factors.                                                                   │

│  ===Genetics===                                                             │
│  There is strong evidence that autism is caused by genetic factors.         │
│  Studies of twins show that if one identical twin has autism, the other     │
│  will also have it in 70-90% of cases. In contrast, if one non-identical    │
│  twin has autism, the other will have it in only 5-10% of cases. This       │
│  indicates that autism is highly heritable.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Several genes have been implicated in autism, but no single gene has been  │
│  found to cause the majority of cases. It is likely that multiple genes     │
│  interact to increase the risk of autism. Some of the genes that have been  │
│  linked to autism are involved in brain development, synapse formation,     │
│  and neuronal communication.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Environmental factors===                                                │
│  Environmental factors are also thought to play a role in the development   │
│  of autism, although their exact contribution is not yet clear. Some        │
│  proposed environmental factors include:                                    │
│  * **Prenatal factors:** Exposure to certain medications (e.g.,             │
│  valproate), infections (e.g., rubella), or toxins during pregnancy may     │
│  increase the risk of autism.                                               │
│  * **Perinatal factors:** Complications during birth, such as prematurity   │
│  or low birth weight, have been associated with an increased risk of        │
│  autism.                                                                    │
│  * **Postnatal factors:** Some studies have suggested a link between        │
│  autism and certain postnatal factors, such as exposure to air pollution    │
│  or heavy metals, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.    │
│                                                                             │
│  It is important to note that vaccines have been extensively studied and    │
│  have been found not to cause autism. This myth has been widely debunked    │

│  == Diagnosis ==                                                            │
│  Diagnosing autism can be challenging, as there is no single medical test   │
│  for the condition. Instead, diagnosis is based on a comprehensive          │
│  evaluation of a child's developmental history and behavior. This           │
│  evaluation typically involves:                                             │
│  * **Developmental screening:** Pediatricians often conduct developmental   │
│  screenings during routine check-ups to identify children who may be at     │
│  risk for autism.                                                           │
│  * **Diagnostic evaluation:** If a child screens positive for autism, they  │
│  may be referred for a more thorough diagnostic evaluation by a team of     │
│  specialists, including a developmental pediatrician, child psychologist,   │
│  speech-language pathologist, and occupational therapist.                   │
│  * **Behavioral observation:** Specialists observe the child's behavior in  │
│  various settings to assess their social interaction, communication         │
│  skills, and repetitive behaviors.                                          │
│  * **Parent interviews:** Parents provide detailed information about their  │
│  child's developmental history, including their early milestones,           │
│  behaviors, and any concerns they may have.                                 │
│  * **Standardized assessments:** Standardized assessment tools, such as     │
│  the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism           │
│  Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), may be used to aid in diagnosis.     │
│                                                                             │
│  Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes for    │
│  individuals with autism.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  == Treatment ==                                                            │
│  There is no cure for autism, but a variety of interventions can help       │
│  individuals with autism develop new skills and reduce challenging          │
│  behaviors. Treatment plans are individualized and may include:             │
│  * **Behavioral therapies:** Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a widely    │
│  used behavioral therapy that focuses on teaching new skills and reducing   │
│  problem behaviors through positive reinforcement.                          │
│  * **Developmental therapies:** Developmental therapies, such as floortime  │
│  and relationship-based approaches, aim to improve social interaction,      │
│  communication, and emotional regulation.                                   │
│  * **Speech-language therapy:** Speech-language pathologists help           │
│  individuals with autism improve their communication skills, including      │
│  spoken language, nonverbal communication, and social communication.        │
│  * **Occupational therapy:** Occupational therapists help individuals with  │
│  autism develop daily living skills, fine motor skills, and sensory         │
│  processing skills.                                                         │
│  * **Medication:** Medication may be used to manage co-occurring            │
│  conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or hyperactivity, but it does     │
│  not treat the core symptoms of autism.                                     │
│  * **Educational interventions:** Specialized educational programs and      │
│  supports can help students with autism succeed in school.                  │
│  * **Parent training:** Parents play a vital role in their child's          │
│  treatment and can benefit from training and support to learn strategies    │
│  for managing challenging behaviors and promoting development.              │
│                                                                             │
│  The goal of treatment is to help individuals with autism reach their full  │
│  potential and improve their quality of life.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  == Prognosis ==                                                            │
│  The prognosis for individuals with autism varies widely depending on the   │
│  severity of their symptoms, their intellectual abilities, and the          │
│  effectiveness of interventions. Some individuals with autism may achieve   │
│  a high level of independence and lead fulfilling lives, while others may   │
│  require lifelong support.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Factors that are associated with a more positive prognosis include:        │
│  * **Early diagnosis and intervention:** Starting interventions at a young  │
│  age can significantly improve outcomes.                                    │
│  * **Higher intellectual functioning:** Individuals with higher IQs tend    │
│  to have better outcomes.                                                   │
│  * **Development of functional language:** The ability to communicate       │
│  effectively is a strong predictor of positive outcomes.                    │
│  * **Fewer co-occurring conditions:** Individuals with fewer co-occurring   │
│  conditions, such as intellectual disability or epilepsy, tend to have      │
│  better prognoses.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  It is important to remember that autism is a spectrum disorder, and each   │
│  individual's journey is unique. With appropriate support and               │
│  interventions, individuals with autism can make significant progress and   │
│  lead meaningful lives.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  == History ==                                                              │
│  The concept of autism has evolved over time. The term "autism" was first   │
│  coined by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1911 to describe a symptom   │
│  of schizophrenia characterized by withdrawal into an inner world.          │
│  However, it was not until the 1940s that autism was recognized as a        │
│  distinct developmental disorder.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  In 1943, American child psychiatrist Leo Kanner published a seminal paper  │
│  describing 11 children with unique behavioral characteristics, which he    │
│  termed "early infantile autism." Around the same time, Austrian            │
│  pediatrician Hans Asperger described a similar condition in children with  │
│  normal intelligence, which later became known as Asperger's syndrome.      │
│                                                                             │
│  For many years, autism was thought to be a rare condition, and its causes  │
│  were often attributed to "refrigerator mothers" or other psychological     │
│  factors. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, research began   │
│  to shift towards a biological understanding of autism, with a focus on     │
│  genetic and neurological factors.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the diagnosis  │
│  of autism, partly due to increased awareness, broader diagnostic           │
│  criteria, and improved diagnostic tools. Autism is now recognized as a     │
│  complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide range of presentations     │
│  and severities.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  == Culture ==                                                              │
│  The autistic community has developed a distinct culture, often referred    │
│  to as "autistic culture" or "neurodiversity culture." This culture         │
│  emphasizes the idea that autism is a natural variation of the human        │
│  brain, rather than a disorder to be cured. Key aspects of autistic         │
│  culture include:                                                           │
│  * **Neurodiversity:** The belief that neurological differences, including  │
│  autism, are valuable and should be respected.                              │
│  * **Self-advocacy:** Autistic individuals advocating for their own rights  │
│  and needs.                                                                 │
│  * **Community:** The formation of online and offline communities where     │
│  autistic individuals can connect, share experiences, and find support.     │
│  * **Identity:** The development of a positive autistic identity and pride  │
│  in one's autistic traits.                                                  │
│  * **Communication styles:** A preference for direct, literal               │
│  communication and an appreciation for alternative communication methods.   │
│                                                                             │
│  Autistic culture challenges traditional medical models of autism and       │
│  promotes a more inclusive and accepting view of neurological diversity.    │
│                                                                             │
│  == Notable people ==                                                       │
│  Many notable individuals throughout history and in contemporary society    │
│  are believed to have been autistic or have openly identified as autistic.  │
│  These individuals have made significant contributions in various fields,   │
│  demonstrating the diverse talents and abilities within the autistic        │
│  community. Some examples include:                                          │
│  * **Temple Grandin:** A prominent animal scientist and autism advocate     │
│  who has revolutionized livestock handling practices.                       │
│  * **Albert Einstein:** The renowned theoretical physicist, often           │
│  speculated to have had autistic traits.                                    │
│  * **Isaac Newton:** The influential physicist and mathematician, also      │
│  often speculated to have had autistic traits.                              │
│  * **Greta Thunberg:** A young environmental activist who has openly        │
│  spoken about her Asperger's syndrome.                                      │
│  * **Dan Aykroyd:** A Canadian actor, comedian, and writer who has been     │
│  diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  These examples highlight that autism does not preclude individuals from    │
│  achieving great things and making a positive impact on the world.          │

│  The causes of autism are not well understood. There is strong evidence     │
│  that autism is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental        │
│  factors.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Genetics===                                                             │
│  There is strong evidence that autism is caused by genetic factors.         │
│  Studies of twins show that if one identical twin has autism, the other     │
│  will also have it in 70-90% of cases. In contrast, if one non-identical    │
│  twin has autism, the other will have it in only 5-10% of cases. This       │
│  indicates that autism is highly heritable.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Several genes have been implicated in autism, but no single gene has been  │
│  found to cause the majority of cases. It is likely that multiple genes     │
│  interact to increase the risk of autism. Some of the genes that have been  │
│  linked to autism are involved in brain development, synapse formation,     │
│  and neuronal communication.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Environmental factors===                                                │
│  Environmental factors are also thought to play a role in the development   │
│  of autism, although their exact contribution is not yet clear. Some        │
│  proposed environmental factors include:                                    │
│  * **Prenatal factors:** Exposure to certain medications (e.g.,             │
│  valproate), infections (e.g., rubella), or toxins during pregnancy may     │
│  increase the risk of autism.                                               │
│  * **Perinatal factors:** Complications during birth, such as prematurity   │
│  or low birth weight, have been associated with an increased risk of        │
│  autism.                                                                    │
│  * **Postnatal factors:** Some studies have suggested a link between        │
│  autism and certain postnatal factors, such as exposure to air pollution    │
│  or heavy metals, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.    │
│                                                                             │
│  It is important to note that vaccines have been extensively studied and    │
│  have been found not to cause autism. This myth has been widely debunked    │
│  by scientific research.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  == Diagnosis ==                                                            │
│  Diagnosing autism can be challenging, as there is no single medical test   │
│  for the condition. Instead, diagnosis is based on a comprehensive          │
│  evaluation of a child's developmental history and behavior. This           │
│  evaluation typically involves:                                             │
│  * **Developmental screening:** Pediatricians often conduct developmental   │
│  screenings during routine check-ups to identify children who may be at     │
│  risk for autism.                                                           │
│  * **Diagnostic evaluation:** If a child screens positive for autism, they  │
│  may be referred for a more thorough diagnostic evaluation by a team of     │
│  specialists, including a developmental pediatrician, child psychologist,   │
│  speech-language pathologist, and occupational therapist.                   │
│  * **Behavioral observation:** Specialists observe the child's behavior in  │
│  various settings to assess their social interaction, communication         │
│  skills, and repetitive behaviors.                                          │
│  * **Parent interviews:** Parents provide detailed information about their  │
│  child's developmental history, including their early milestones,           │
│  behaviors, and any concerns they may have.                                 │
│  * **Standardized assessments:** Standardized assessment tools, such as     │
│  the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism           │
│  Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), may be used to aid in diagnosis.     │
│                                                                             │
│  Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes for    │
│  individuals with autism.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  == Treatment ==                                                            │
│  There is no cure for autism, but a variety of interventions can help       │
│  individuals with autism develop new skills and reduce challenging          │
│  behaviors. Treatment plans are individualized and may include:             │
│  * **Behavioral therapies:** Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a widely    │
│  used behavioral therapy that focuses on teaching new skills and reducing   │
│  problem behaviors through positive reinforcement.                          │
│  * **Developmental therapies:** Developmental therapies, such as floortime  │
│  and relationship-based approaches, aim to improve social interaction,      │
│  communication, and emotional regulation.                                   │
│  * **Speech-language therapy:** Speech-language pathologists help           │
│  individuals with autism improve their communication skills, including      │
│  spoken language, nonverbal communication, and social communication.        │
│  * **Occupational therapy:** Occupational therapists help individuals with  │
│  autism develop daily living skills, fine motor skills, and sensory         │
│  processing skills.                                                         │
│  * **Medication:** Medication may be used to manage co-occurring            │
│  conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or hyperactivity, but it does     │
│  not treat the core symptoms of autism.                                     │
│  * **Educational interventions:** Specialized educational programs and      │
│  supports can help students with autism succeed in school.                  │
│  * **Parent training:** Parents play a vital role in their child's          │
│  treatment and can benefit from training and support to learn strategies    │
│  for managing challenging behaviors and promoting development.              │
│                                                                             │
│  The goal of treatment is to help individuals with autism reach their full  │
│  potential and improve their quality of life.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  == Prognosis ==                                                            │
│  The prognosis for individuals with autism varies widely depending on the   │
│  severity of their symptoms, their intellectual abilities, and the          │
│  effectiveness of interventions. Some individuals with autism may achieve   │
│  a high level of independence and lead fulfilling lives, while others may   │
│  require lifelong support.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Factors that are associated with a more positive prognosis include:        │
│  * **Early diagnosis and intervention:** Starting interventions at a young  │
│  age can significantly improve outcomes.                                    │
│  * **Higher intellectual functioning:** Individuals with higher IQs tend    │
│  to have better outcomes.                                                   │
│  * **Development of functional language:** The ability to communicate       │
│  effectively is a strong predictor of positive outcomes.                    │
│  * **Fewer co-occurring conditions:** Individuals with fewer co-occurring   │
│  conditions, such as intellectual disability or epilepsy, tend to have      │
│  better prognoses.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  It is important to remember that autism is a spectrum disorder, and each   │
│  individual's journey is unique. With appropriate support and               │
│  interventions, individuals with autism can make significant progress and   │
│  lead meaningful lives.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  == History ==                                                              │
│  The concept of autism has evolved over time. The term "autism" was first   │
│  coined by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1911 to describe a symptom   │
│  of schizophrenia characterized by withdrawal into an inner world.          │
│  However, it was not until the 1940s that autism was recognized as a        │
│  distinct developmental disorder.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  In 1943, American child psychiatrist Leo Kanner published a seminal paper  │
│  describing 11 children with unique behavioral characteristics, which he    │
│  termed "early infantile autism." Around the same time, Austrian            │
│  pediatrician Hans Asperger described a similar condition in children with  │
│  normal intelligence, which later became known as Asperger's syndrome.      │
│                                                                             │
│  For many years, autism was thought to be a rare condition, and its causes  │
│  were often attributed to "refrigerator mothers" or other psychological     │
│  factors. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, research began   │
│  to shift towards a biological understanding of autism, with a focus on     │
│  genetic and neurological factors.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the diagnosis  │
│  of autism, partly due to increased awareness, broader diagnostic           │
│  criteria, and improved diagnostic tools. Autism is now recognized as a     │
│  complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide range of presentations     │
│  and severities.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  == Culture ==                                                              │
│  The autistic community has developed a distinct culture, often referred    │
│  to as "autistic culture" or "neurodiversity culture." This culture         │
│  emphasizes the idea that autism is a natural variation of the human        │
│  brain, rather than a disorder to be cured. Key aspects of autistic         │
│  culture include:                                                           │
│  * **Neurodiversity:** The belief that neurological differences, including  │
│  autism, are valuable and should be respected.                              │
│  * **Self-advocacy:** Autistic individuals advocating for their own rights  │
│  and needs.                                                                 │
│  * **Community:** The formation of online and offline communities where     │
│  autistic individuals can connect, share experiences, and find support.     │
│  * **Identity:** The development of a positive autistic identity and pride  │
│  in one's autistic traits.                                                  │
│  * **Communication styles:** A preference for direct, literal               │
│  communication and an appreciation for alternative communication methods.   │
│                                                                             │
│  Autistic culture challenges traditional medical models of autism and       │
│  promotes a more inclusive and accepting view of neurological diversity.    │
│                                                                             │

The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder.\n\n== Causes ==\nThe causes of autism are not well understood. There is strong evidence that autism is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n===Genetics===\nThere is strong evidence that autism is caused by genetic factors. Studies of twins show that if one identical twin has autism, the other will also have it in 70-90% of cases. In contrast, if one non-identical twin has autism, the other will have it in only 5-10% of cases. This indicates that autism is highly heritable.\n\nSeveral genes have been implicated in autism, but no single gene has been found to cause the majority of cases. It is likely that multiple genes interact to increase the risk of autism. Some of the genes that have been linked to autism are involved in brain development, synapse formation, and neuronal communication.\n\n===Environmental factors===\nEnvironmental factors are also thought to play a role in the development of autism, although their exact contribution is not yet clear. Some proposed environmental factors include:\n* **Prenatal factors:** Exposure to certain medications (e.g., valproate), infections (e.g., rubella), or toxins during pregnancy may increase the risk of autism.\n* **Perinatal factors:** Complications during birth, such as prematurity or low birth weight, have been associated with an increased risk of autism.\n* **Postnatal factors:** Some studies have suggested a link between autism and certain postnatal factors, such as exposure to air pollution or heavy metals, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nIt is important to note that vaccines have been extensively studied and have been found not to cause autism. This myth has been widely debunked by scientific research.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nDiagnosing autism can be challenging, as there is no single medical test for the condition. Instead, diagnosis is based on a comprehensive evaluation of a child's developmental history and behavior. This evaluation typically involves:\n* **Developmental screening:** Pediatricians often conduct developmental screenings during routine check-ups to identify children who may be at risk for autism.\n* **Diagnostic evaluation:** If a child screens positive for autism, they may be referred for a more thorough diagnostic evaluation by a team of specialists, including a developmental pediatrician, child psychologist, speech-language pathologist, and occupational therapist.\n* **Behavioral observation:** Specialists observe the child's behavior in various settings to assess their social interaction, communication skills, and repetitive behaviors.\n* **Parent interviews:** Parents provide detailed information about their child's developmental history, including their early milestones, behaviors, and any concerns they may have.\n* **Standardized assessments:** Standardized assessment tools, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), may be used to aid in diagnosis.\n\nEarly diagnosis and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes for individuals with autism.\n\n== Treatment ==\nThere is no cure for autism, but a variety of interventions can help individuals with autism develop new skills and reduce challenging behaviors. Treatment plans are individualized and may include:\n* **Behavioral therapies:** Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a widely used behavioral therapy that focuses on teaching new skills and reducing problem behaviors through positive reinforcement.\n* **Developmental therapies:** Developmental therapies, such as floortime and relationship-based approaches, aim to improve social interaction, communication, and emotional regulation.\n* **Speech-language therapy:** Speech-language pathologists help individuals with autism improve their communication skills, including spoken language, nonverbal communication, and social communication.\n* **Occupational therapy:** Occupational therapists help individuals with autism develop daily living skills, fine motor skills, and sensory processing skills.\n* **Medication:** Medication may be used to manage co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or hyperactivity, but it does not treat the core symptoms of autism.\n* **Educational interventions:** Specialized educational programs and supports can help students with autism succeed in school.\n* **Parent training:** Parents play a vital role in their child's treatment and can benefit from training and support to learn strategies for managing challenging behaviors and promoting development.\n\nThe goal of treatment is to help individuals with autism reach their full potential and improve their quality of life.\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThe prognosis for individuals with autism varies widely depending on the severity of their symptoms, their intellectual abilities, and the effectiveness of interventions. Some individuals with autism may achieve a high level of independence and lead fulfilling lives, while others may require lifelong support.\n\nFactors that are associated with a more positive prognosis include:\n* **Early diagnosis and intervention:** Starting interventions at a young age can significantly improve outcomes.\n* **Higher intellectual functioning:** Individuals with higher IQs tend to have better outcomes.\n* **Development of functional language:** The ability to communicate effectively is a strong predictor of positive outcomes.\n* **Fewer co-occurring conditions:** Individuals with fewer co-occurring conditions, such as intellectual disability or epilepsy, tend to have better prognoses.\n\nIt is important to remember that autism is a spectrum disorder, and each individual's journey is unique. With appropriate support and interventions, individuals with autism can make significant progress and lead meaningful lives.\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of autism has evolved over time. The term \"autism\" was first coined by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1911 to describe a symptom of schizophrenia characterized by withdrawal into an inner world. However, it was not until the 1940s that autism was recognized as a distinct developmental disorder.\n\nIn 1943, American child psychiatrist Leo Kanner published a seminal paper describing 11 children with unique behavioral characteristics, which he termed \"early infantile autism.\" Around the same time, Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger described a similar condition in children with normal intelligence, which later became known as Asperger's syndrome.\n\nFor many years, autism was thought to be a rare condition, and its causes were often attributed to \"refrigerator mothers\" or other psychological factors. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, research began to shift towards a biological understanding of autism, with a focus on genetic and neurological factors.\n\nIn recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the diagnosis of autism, partly due to increased awareness, broader diagnostic criteria, and improved diagnostic tools. Autism is now recognized as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide range of presentations and severities.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe autistic community has developed a distinct culture, often referred to as \"autistic culture\" or \"neurodiversity culture.\" This culture emphasizes the idea that autism is a natural variation of the human brain, rather than a disorder to be cured. Key aspects of autistic culture include:\n* **Neurodiversity:** The belief that neurological differences, including autism, are valuable and should be respected.\n* **Self-advocacy:** Autistic individuals advocating for their own rights and needs.\n* **Community:** The formation of online and offline communities where autistic individuals can connect, share experiences, and find support.\n* **Identity:** The development of a positive autistic identity and pride in one's autistic traits.\n* **Communication styles:** A preference for direct, literal communication and an appreciation for alternative communication methods.\n\nAutistic culture challenges traditional medical models of autism and promotes a more inclusive and accepting view of neurological diversity.\n\n== Notable people ==\nMany notable individuals throughout history and in contemporary society are believed to have been autistic or have openly identified as autistic. These individuals have made significant contributions in various fields, demonstrating the diverse talents and abilities within the autistic community. Some examples include:\n* **Temple Grandin:** A prominent animal scientist and autism advocate who has revolutionized livestock handling practices.\n* **Albert Einstein:** The renowned theoretical physicist, often speculated to have had autistic traits.\n* **Isaac Newton:** The influential physicist and mathematician, also often speculated to have had autistic traits.\n* **Greta Thunberg:** A young environmental activist who has openly spoken about her Asperger's syndrome.\n* **Dan Aykroyd:** A Canadian actor, comedian, and writer who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome.\n\nThese examples highlight that autism does not preclude individuals from achieving great things and making a positive impact on the world.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Asperger syndrome]]\n* [[Autism spectrum]]\n*

== Causes ==
The causes of autism are not well understood. There is strong evidence that autism is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

===Genetics===
There is strong evidence that autism is caused by genetic factors. Studies of twins show that if one identical twin has autism, the other will also have it in 70-90% of cases. In contrast, if one non-identical twin has autism, the other will have it in only 5-10% of cases. This indicates that autism is highly heritable.

Several genes have been implicated in autism, but no single gene has been found to cause the majority of cases. It is likely that multiple genes interact to increase the risk of autism. Some of the genes that have been linked to autism are involved in brain development, synapse formation, and neuronal communication.

===Environmental factors===
Environmental factors are also thought to play a role in the development of autism, although their exact contribution is not yet clear. Some proposed environmental factors include:
* **Prenatal factors:** Exposure to certain medications (e.g., valproate), infections (e.g., rubella), or toxins during pregnancy may increase the risk of autism.
* **Perinatal factors:** Complications during birth, such as prematurity or low birth weight, have been associated with an increased risk of autism.
* **Postnatal factors:** Some studies have suggested a link between autism and certain postnatal factors, such as exposure to air pollution or heavy metals, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.

It is important to note that vaccines have been extensively studied and have been found not to cause autism. This myth has been widely debunked by scientific research.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosing autism can be challenging, as there is no single medical test for the condition. Instead, diagnosis is based on a comprehensive evaluation of a child's developmental history and behavior. This evaluation typically involves:
* **Developmental screening:** Pediatricians often conduct developmental screenings during routine check-ups to identify children who may be at risk for autism.
* **Diagnostic evaluation:** If a child screens positive for autism, they may be referred for a more thorough diagnostic evaluation by a team of specialists, including a developmental pediatrician, child psychologist, speech-language pathologist, and occupational therapist.
* **Behavioral observation:** Specialists observe the child's behavior in various settings to assess their social interaction, communication skills, and repetitive behaviors.
* **Parent interviews:** Parents provide detailed information about their child's developmental history, including their early milestones, behaviors, and any concerns they may have.
* **Standardized assessments:** Standardized assessment tools, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), may be used to aid in diagnosis.

Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes for individuals with autism.

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for autism, but a variety of interventions can help individuals with autism develop new skills and reduce challenging behaviors. Treatment plans are individualized and may include:
* **Behavioral therapies:** Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a widely used behavioral therapy that focuses on teaching new skills and reducing problem behaviors through positive reinforcement.
* **Developmental therapies:** Developmental therapies, such as floortime and relationship-based approaches, aim to improve social interaction, communication, and emotional regulation.
* **Speech-language therapy:** Speech-language pathologists help individuals with autism improve their communication skills, including spoken language, nonverbal communication, and social communication.
* **Occupational therapy:** Occupational therapists help individuals with autism develop daily living skills, fine motor skills, and sensory processing skills.
* **Medication:** Medication may be used to manage co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or hyperactivity, but it does not treat the core symptoms of autism.
* **Educational interventions:** Specialized educational programs and supports can help students with autism succeed in school.
* **Parent training:** Parents play a vital role in their child's treatment and can benefit from training and support to learn strategies for managing challenging behaviors and promoting development.

The goal of treatment is to help individuals with autism reach their full potential and improve their quality of life.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for individuals with autism varies widely depending on the severity of their symptoms, their intellectual abilities, and the effectiveness of interventions. Some individuals with autism may achieve a high level of independence and lead fulfilling lives, while others may require lifelong support.

Factors that are associated with a more positive prognosis include:
* **Early diagnosis and intervention:** Starting interventions at a young age can significantly improve outcomes.
* **Higher intellectual functioning:** Individuals with higher IQs tend to have better outcomes.
* **Development of functional language:** The ability to communicate effectively is a strong predictor of positive outcomes.
* **Fewer co-occurring conditions:** Individuals with fewer co-occurring conditions, such as intellectual disability or epilepsy, tend to have better prognoses.

It is important to remember that autism is a spectrum disorder, and each individual's journey is unique. With appropriate support and interventions, individuals with autism can make significant progress and lead meaningful lives.

== History ==
The concept of autism has evolved over time. The term "autism" was first coined by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1911 to describe a symptom of schizophrenia characterized by withdrawal into an inner world. However, it was not until the 1940s that autism was recognized as a distinct developmental disorder.

In 1943, American child psychiatrist Leo Kanner published a seminal paper describing 11 children with unique behavioral characteristics, which he termed "early infantile autism." Around the same time, Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger described a similar condition in children with normal intelligence, which later became known as Asperger's syndrome.

For many years, autism was thought to be a rare condition, and its causes were often attributed to "refrigerator mothers" or other psychological factors. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, research began to shift towards a biological understanding of autism, with a focus on genetic and neurological factors.

In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the diagnosis of autism, partly due to increased awareness, broader diagnostic criteria, and improved diagnostic tools. Autism is now recognized as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide range of presentations and severities.

== Culture ==
The autistic community has developed a distinct culture, often referred to as "autistic culture" or "neurodiversity culture." This culture emphasizes the idea that autism is a natural variation of the human brain, rather than a disorder to be cured. Key aspects of autistic culture include:
* **Neurodiversity:** The belief that neurological differences, including autism, are valuable and should be respected.
* **Self-advocacy:** Autistic individuals advocating for their own rights and needs.
* **Community:** The formation of online and offline communities where autistic individuals can connect, share experiences, and find support.
* **Identity:** The development of a positive autistic identity and pride in one's autistic traits.
* **Communication styles:** A preference for direct, literal communication and an appreciation for alternative communication methods.

Autistic culture challenges traditional medical models of autism and promotes a more inclusive and accepting view of neurological diversity.

== Notable people ==
Many notable individuals throughout history and in contemporary society are believed to have been autistic or have openly identified as autistic. These individuals have made significant contributions in various fields, demonstrating the diverse talents and abilities within the autistic community. Some examples include:
* **Temple Grandin:** A prominent animal scientist and autism advocate who has revolutionized livestock handling practices.
* **Albert Einstein:** The renowned theoretical physicist, often speculated to have had autistic traits.
* **Isaac Newton:** The influential physicist and mathematician, also often speculated to have had autistic traits.
* **Greta Thunberg:** A young environmental activist who has openly spoken about her Asperger's syndrome.
* **Dan Aykroyd:** A Canadian actor, comedian, and writer who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome.

These examples highlight that autism does not preclude individuals from achieving great things and making a positive impact on the world.
