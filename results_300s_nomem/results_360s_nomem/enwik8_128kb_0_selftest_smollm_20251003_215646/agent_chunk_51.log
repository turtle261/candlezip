│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task:** My primary goal is to     │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by finding the exact, immediate   │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided text prefix. This requires    │
│  aggressive use of available tools to locate the source document within     │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The output must be plain     │
│  text, free of any markup or commentary.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    a.       │
│  **Explore Directory:** Use `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm access  │
│  and `directory_tree(\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')` to understand the   │
│  file structure within the allowed sink directory. This initial             │
│  exploration helps in identifying potential source files or subdirectories  │
│  that might contain the relevant information.\n    b. **Search for          │
│  Prefix:** Employ `search_files_content()` to search for the exact text     │
│  prefix within all files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.   │
│  The query will be the entire provided prefix, carefully escaped to ensure  │
│  an exact match, including newlines and special characters.\n    c.         │
│  **Extract Continuation:** If the prefix is found, identify the file path.  │
│  Then, use `read_text_file()` to read the content of that file. Locate the  │
│  end of the prefix within the file content and extract the subsequent       │
│  100-200 words.\n    d. **Clean and Format:** Apply a cleaning process      │
│  similar to the "Prior memory" example to remove any Wikipedia-like markup  │
│  (e.g., `[[...|...]]`, `{{...}}`, `\'\'\'`, `&quot;`) and ensure the        │
│  output is strictly plain text.\n    e. **Handle Failure (Fallback):** If   │
│  `search_files_content` does not find the prefix, I will acknowledge that   │
│  the exact source is not available within the allowed directory. In this    │
│  scenario, I will generate a continuation based on the context provided in  │
│  the prompt, adhering to the "If ALL tools fail" guidelines, focusing on    │
│  specificity and natural flow. However, the primary directive is to find    │
│  the exact continuation using tools.\n\n3. **Approach Challenges:**\n       │
│  a. **Exact Match Difficulty:** The prefix is long and contains specific    │
│  formatting (e.g., `[[...]]`, `{{ref|...}}`, `&quot;`). Ensuring the        │
│  `search_files_content` query is perfectly matched is crucial. I will       │
│  construct the query carefully, escaping all necessary characters and       │
│  preserving newlines.\n    b. **Markup Cleaning:** The "Prior memory"       │
│  section provides a robust regex-based cleaning strategy for Wikipedia      │
│  markup. I will adapt and apply this strategy to the extracted              │
│  continuation to meet the "plain text only" requirement.\n    c. **Tool     │
│  Limitations:** My access to external information is strictly limited to    │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I do not have direct access  │
│  to general web search or Wikipedia APIs. Therefore, my strategy must       │
│  entirely rely on finding the source within the provided file               │
│  system.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                             │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path.\n    *       │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To gain an        │
│  initial understanding of the directory\'s contents, which might hint at    │
│  the type of files present (e.g., text files, archives).\n    *             │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'ed    │
│  his patients as "little professors".]]\nIn the current [[Diagnostic and    │
│  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), the most             │
│  significant difference between Autistic Disorder (Kanner\'s) and           │
│  Asperger\'s syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the        │
│  observation of "[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the    │
│  following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction,  │
│  (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or           │
│  imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of Asperger\'s    │
│  syndrome observes "no clinically significant delay" in these areas.        │
│  {{ref|bnas}}\n\nThe DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual          │
│  functioning, but the fact that Asperger\'s autistics as a group tend to    │
│  perform better than those with Kanner\'s autism has produced a popular     │
│  conception that \'\'[[Asperger\'s syndrome]]\'\' is synonymous with        │
│  "higher-functioning autism," or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than      │
│  \'\'autism\'\'.  There is also a popular but not necessarily true          │
│  conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of              │
│  intellectual functioning have Asperger\'s autism or that both types are    │
│  merely [[geek]]s with a medical label attached. Also, autism has evolved   │
│  in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism      │
│  with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in \'\'[[Rain          │
│  Man]]\'\' has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the      │
│  autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having Asperger\'s       │
│  syndrome rather than autism.\n\n===Autism as a spectrum                    │
│  disorder===\n{{details|Autistic spectrum}}\n\nAnother view of these        │
│  disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]]   │
│  disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]],    │
│  which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our   │
│  senses.  Autism, Asperger\'s syndrome, and Sensory Integration             │
│  Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.\n\nThere are two main     │
│  manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early      │
│  infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while      │
│  regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months.   │
│  Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological           │
│  differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only   │
│  a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This        │
│  triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the     │
│  mother\'s body and is transfered to the fetus. The triggering could also   │
│  occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of   │
│  the child due to a toxin directly entering the child\'s body.\n\n==        │
│  Increase in diagnoses of autism ==\n{{details|Autism                       │
│  epidemic}}\n\n[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of   │
│  reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade.  │
│  Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health                  │
│  Statistics]].]]\nThere has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases   │
│  of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of         │
│  increases in the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple             │
│  personality disorder]] in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to  │
│  a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden              │
│  increase.\n\nEpidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the       │
│  United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic  │
│  criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to        │
│  receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the         │
│  [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed    │
│  that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating         │
│  factors are accounted for (see reference in this section below).\n\nOther  │
│  researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including Dr.       │
│  Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas        │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, "There is a chance  │
│  we\'re seeing a true rise, but right now I don\'t think anybody can        │
│  answer that question for sure." ([[Newsweek]] reference below).\n\nThe     │
│  answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of  │
│  research, since a \'\'real increase\'\' would focus more attention (and    │
│  research funding) on the search for environmental factors, while           │
│  \'\'little or no real increase\'\' would focus more attention to           │
│  genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental  │
│  factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular        │
│  impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little     │
│  public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the        │
│  number of incidences of autism.\n\nOne of the more popular theories is     │
│  that there is a connection between "geekdom" and autism.  This is hinted,  │
│  for instance, by a \'\'Wired Magazine\'\' article in 2001 entitled "The    │
│  [[Geek]] Syndrome", which is a point argued by many in the autism rights   │
│  movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many professionals assert, is just   │
│  one example of the media\'s application of mental disease labels to what   │
│  is actually variant normal behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness,     │
│  lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests,     │
│  even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of      │
│  autism or Asperger\'s syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the      │
│  medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children     │
│  who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or   │
│  even labeled \'gifted\'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of   │
│  this issue.\n\nDue to the recent publicity surrounding autism and          │
│  autistic spectrum disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing   │
│  to seek diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger\'s syndrome in    │
│  light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during          │
│  childhood. Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly      │
│  genetic, a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis             │
│  specifically as follow-up to their children\'s diagnoses. Because autism   │
│  falls into the [[pervasive developmental disorder]] category, strictly     │
│  speaking, symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age    │
│  seven in order to make a [[differential diagnosis]].\n\n== Therapies       │
│  ==\n{{details|Autism therapies}}\n\n==Sociology==\nDue to the complexity   │
│  of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]] that need to be          │
│  considered when discussing it, such as the culture which has evolved from  │
│  autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another.  In        │
│  addition, there are several subgroups forming within the autistic          │
│  community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.\n\n===Community  │
│  and politics===\n{{details|Autistic community}}\n{{details|Autism rights   │
│  movement}}\n\nMuch like many other controversies in the world, the         │
│  autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups.          │
│  Essentially, these groups are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed     │
│  \'\'pro-cure\'\', those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such    │
│  resist it, dubbed \'\'anti-cure\'\', and the many people caught in the     │
│  middle of the two.  In recent history, with scientists learning more       │
│  about autism and possibly coming closer to a cure, some members of the     │
│  "anti-cure" movement [[Autistic community#Declaration from the autism      │
│  community|sent a letter to the United Nations]] demanding to be treated    │
│  as a minority group rather than a group with a [[mental disability]] or    │
│  disease. Websites such as  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the     │
│  view of the anti-cure group.\n\nThere are numerous resources available     │
│  for autistics from many groups.  Due to the fact that many autistics find  │
│  it easier to communicate online than in person, many of these resources    │
│  are available online.  In addition, sometimes successful autistic adults   │
│  in a local community will help out children with autism, much in\')`:      │

│  of the identified source file.\n    *   Python string methods (`find`,     │
│  slicing) and `re` module: For precise extraction and cleaning of the       │
│  continuation.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome and Alignment:** The expected       │
│  outcome is a 100-200 word plain text continuation that precisely follows   │
│  the given prefix. This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing  │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and     │

│      a. **Exact Match Difficulty:** The prefix is long and contains         │
│  specific formatting (e.g., `[[...]]`, `{{ref|...}}`, `&quot;`). Ensuring   │
│  the `search_files_content` query is perfectly matched is crucial. I will   │
│  construct the query carefully, escaping all necessary characters and       │
│  preserving newlines.                                                       │
│      b. **Markup Cleaning:** The "Prior memory" section provides a robust   │
│  regex-based cleaning strategy for Wikipedia markup. I will adapt and       │
│  apply this strategy to the extracted continuation to meet the "plain text  │
│  only" requirement.                                                         │
│      c. **Tool Limitations:** My access to external information is          │
│  strictly limited to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I do     │
│  not have direct access to general web search or Wikipedia APIs.            │
│  Therefore, my strategy must entirely rely on finding the source within     │
│  the provided file system.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path.      │
│      *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To gain an  │
│  initial understanding of the directory's contents, which might hint at     │
│  the type of files present (e.g., text files, archives).                    │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │

│  In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]   │
│  (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder     │
│  (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former       │
│  includes the observation of "[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least  │
│  one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social    │
│  interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)          │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger's syndrome observes "no clinically significant delay" in these    │
│  areas. {{ref|bnas}}                                                        │

│  The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the     │
│  fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than      │
│  those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that          │
│  ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with "higher-functioning         │
│  autism," or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There is    │
│  also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic       │
│  individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's  │
│  autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label        │
│  attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the    │
│  popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as           │
│  accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of        │
│  family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved  │
│  ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as   │
│  [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory         │
│  Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the        │
│  information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and  │
│  Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.       │
│                                                                             │
│  There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive        │
│  autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is        │
│  present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and    │
│  often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when   │
│  the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe  │
│  that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the       │
│  disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin      │
│  that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The          │
│  triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous   │
│  system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the       │
│  child's body.                                                              │

│  There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over     │
│  the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the       │
│  diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in    │
│  the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different      │
│  theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is   │
│  partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria,         │
│  reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive          │
│  federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D.      │
│  Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the      │
│  increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are      │
│  accounted for (see reference in this section below).                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including     │
│  Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas    │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, "There is a chance  │
│  we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer   │
│  that question for sure." ([[Newsweek]] reference below).                   │
│                                                                             │
│  The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the           │
│  direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more          │
│  attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors,  │
│  while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to         │
│  genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental  │
│  factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular        │
│  impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little     │
│  public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the        │
│  number of incidences of autism.                                            │

│  One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between     │
│  "geekdom" and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a ''Wired          │
│  Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled "The [[Geek]] Syndrome", which is a    │
│  point argued by many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This     │
│  article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the media's     │
│  application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal    │
│  behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or    │
│  social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to  │
│  others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome.      │
│  Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is          │
│  applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have      │
│  simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled 'gifted'. See   │
│  [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum       │
│  disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses   │
│  of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms     │
│  they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the       │
│  cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of  │
│  these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their   │
│  children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive            │
│  developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have   │
│  been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a        │

│  that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which   │
│  has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one    │
│  another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the      │
│  autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.         │

│  Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community    │

│  are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do    │
│  not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'',  │
│  and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history,   │
│  with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to   │
│  a cure, some members of the "anti-cure" movement [[Autistic                │
│  community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the       │

│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │

│  ###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or  │

│  In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]   │
│  (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder     │
│  (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former       │
│  includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at   │
│  least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1)     │
│  social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)   │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger's syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot;   │
│  in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}                                               │

│  The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the     │
│  fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than      │
│  those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that          │
│  ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning    │
│  autism,&quot; or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There  │
│  is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic    │
│  individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's  │
│  autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label        │
│  attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the    │
│  popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as           │
│  accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of        │
│  family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved  │
│  ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as   │
│  [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory         │
│  Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the        │
│  information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and  │
│  Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.       │
│                                                                             │
│  There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive        │
│  autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is        │
│  present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and    │
│  often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when   │
│  the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe  │
│  that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the       │
│  disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin      │
│  that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The          │
│  triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous   │
│  system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the       │
│  child's body.                                                              │

│  There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over     │
│  the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the       │
│  diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in    │
│  the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different      │
│  theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is   │
│  partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria,         │
│  reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive          │
│  federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D.      │
│  Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the      │
│  increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are      │
│  accounted for (see reference in this section below).                       │

│  Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas    │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, &quot;There is a    │

│  who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or   │
│  even labeled 'gifted'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of     │

│  Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum       │
│  disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses   │
│  of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms     │
│  they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the       │
│  cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of  │
│  these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their   │
│  children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive            │
│  developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have   │
│  been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a        │

│  Due to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]]    │
│  that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which   │
│  has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one    │
│  another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the      │
│  autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.         │
│                                                                             │

│  Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community    │
│  itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups  │
│  are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do    │
│  not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'',  │
│  and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history,   │
│  with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to   │
│  a cure, some members of the &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement [[Autistic      │
│  community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the       │
│  United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than   │
│  a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Websites such as          │
│  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure group.   │
│                                                                             │
│  There are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.     │
│  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online   │
│  than in person, many of these resources are available online.  In          │
│  addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will   │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task:** My primary goal is to minimize future token    │
│  prediction entropy by finding the exact, immediate continuation (100-200   │
│  words) of the provided text prefix. This requires aggressive use of        │
│  available tools to locate the source document within the                   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The output must be plain text,   │
│  free of any markup or commentary.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Explore Directory:** Use `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm  │
│  access and `directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` to understand  │
│  the file structure within the allowed sink directory. This initial         │
│  exploration helps in identifying potential source files or subdirectories  │
│  that might contain the relevant information.                               │
│      b. **Search for Prefix:** Employ `search_files_content()` to search    │
│  for the exact text prefix within all files in the                          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The query will be the entire     │
│  provided prefix, carefully escaped to ensure an exact match, including     │
│  newlines and special characters.                                           │
│      c. **Extract Continuation:** If the prefix is found, identify the      │
│  file path. Then, use `read_text_file()` to read the content of that file.  │
│  Locate the end of the prefix within the file content and extract the       │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.                                                  │
│      d. **Clean and Format:** Apply a cleaning process similar to the       │
│  "Prior memory" example to remove any Wikipedia-like markup (e.g.,          │
│  `[[...|...]]`, `{{...}}`, `'''`, `&quot;`) and ensure the output is        │
│  strictly plain text.                                                       │
│      e. **Handle Failure (Fallback):** If `search_files_content` does not   │
│  find the prefix, I will acknowledge that the exact source is not           │
│  available within the allowed directory. In this scenario, I will generate  │
│  a continuation based on the context provided in the prompt, adhering to    │
│  the "If ALL tools fail" guidelines, focusing on specificity and natural    │
│  flow. However, the primary directive is to find the exact continuation     │
│  using tools.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      a. **Exact Match Difficulty:** The prefix is long and contains         │
│  specific formatting (e.g., `[[...]]`, `{{ref|...}}`, `&quot;`). Ensuring   │
│  the `search_files_content` query is perfectly matched is crucial. I will   │
│  construct the query carefully, escaping all necessary characters and       │
│  preserving newlines.                                                       │
│      b. **Markup Cleaning:** The "Prior memory" section provides a robust   │
│  regex-based cleaning strategy for Wikipedia markup. I will adapt and       │
│  apply this strategy to the extracted continuation to meet the "plain text  │
│  only" requirement.                                                         │
│      c. **Tool Limitations:** My access to external information is          │
│  strictly limited to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I do     │
│  not have direct access to general web search or Wikipedia APIs.            │
│  Therefore, my strategy must entirely rely on finding the source within     │
│  the provided file system.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path.      │
│      *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To gain an  │
│  initial understanding of the directory's contents, which might hint at     │
│  the type of files present (e.g., text files, archives).                    │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='ed his patients as "little professors".]]                           │
│  In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]   │
│  (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder     │
│  (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former       │
│  includes the observation of "[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least  │
│  one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social    │
│  interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)          │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger's syndrome observes "no clinically significant delay" in these    │
│  areas. {{ref|bnas}}                                                        │

│  The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the     │
│  fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than      │
│  those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that          │
│  ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with "higher-functioning         │
│  autism," or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There is    │
│  also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic       │
│  individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's  │
│  autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label        │
│  attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the    │
│  popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as           │
│  accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of        │
│  family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved  │
│  ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as   │
│  [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory         │
│  Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the        │
│  information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and  │
│  Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.       │
│                                                                             │
│  There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive        │
│  autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is        │
│  present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and    │
│  often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when   │
│  the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe  │
│  that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the       │
│  disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin      │
│  that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The          │
│  triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous   │
│  system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the       │
│  child's body.                                                              │

│  [[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of reported cases  │
│  of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in   │

│  There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over     │
│  the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the       │
│  diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in    │
│  the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different      │
│  theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is   │
│  partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria,         │
│  reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive          │
│  federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D.      │
│  Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the      │
│  increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are      │
│  accounted for (see reference in this section below).                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including     │
│  Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas    │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, "There is a chance  │
│  we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer   │
│  that question for sure." ([[Newsweek]] reference below).                   │
│                                                                             │
│  The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the           │
│  direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more          │

│  Due to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]]    │
│  that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which   │
│  has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one    │
│  another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the      │
│  autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.         │
│                                                                             │

│  Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community    │
│  itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups  │
│  are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do    │
│  not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'',  │
│  and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history,   │
│  with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to   │
│  a cure, some members of the "anti-cure" movement [[Autistic                │
│  community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the       │
│  United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than   │
│  a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Websites such as          │
│  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure group.   │

│  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online   │

  - Calling tool search_files_content with arguments: {"path":"/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/enwik8_samples","pattern":"enwik8_128kb_*","query":"ed his patients as \"little professors\".]]\nIn the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of \"[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]\u0026quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome observes \"no clinically significant delay\" in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}\n\nThe DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with \"higher-functioning autism,\" or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.\n\n===Autism as a spectrum disorder===\n{{details|Autistic spectrum}}\n\nAnother view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.\n\nThere are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child's body.\n\n== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==\n{{details|Autism epidemic}}\n\n[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]].]]\nThere has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.\n\nEpidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are accounted for (see reference in this section below).\n\nOther researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, \"There is a chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer that question for sure.\" ([[Newsweek]] reference below).\n\nThe answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors, while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the number of incidences of autism.\n\nOne of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between \"geekdom\" and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a ''Wired Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled \"The [[Geek]] Syndrome\", which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior\u0026amp;mdash;they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled 'gifted'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.\n\nDue to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a [[differential diagnosis]].\n\n== Therapies ==\n{{details|Autism therapies}}\n\n==Sociology==\nDue to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]] that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.\n\n===Community and politics===\n{{details|Autistic community}}\n{{details|Autism rights movement}}\n\nMuch like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'', and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history, with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to a cure, some members of the \"anti-cure\" movement [[Autistic community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Websites such as  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure group.\n\nThere are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person, many of these resources are available online.  In addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will help out children with autism, much in"}

│  (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former       │
│  includes the observation of "[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least  │
│  one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social    │
│  interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)          │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger's syndrome observes "no clinically significant delay" in these    │
│  areas. {{ref|bnas}}                                                        │
│  The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the     │
│  fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than      │
│  those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that          │
│  ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with "higher-functioning         │
│  autism," or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There is    │
│  also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic       │
│  individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's  │
│  autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label        │
│  attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the    │
│  popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as           │
│  accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of        │
│  family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved  │
│  ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.                     │

│  {{details|Autistic spectrum}}                                              │
│  Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as   │
│  [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory         │
│  Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the        │
│  information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and  │
│  Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.       │
│  There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive        │
│  autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is        │
│  present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and    │
│  often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when   │
│  the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe  │
│  that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the       │
│  disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin      │
│  that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The          │
│  triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous   │
│  system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the       │
│  child's body.                                                              │

│  diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in    │
│  the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different      │
│  theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.                          │
│  Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is   │
│  partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria,         │
│  reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive          │
│  federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D.      │
│  Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the      │
│  increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are      │
│  accounted for (see reference in this section below).                       │
│  Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including     │
│  Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas    │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, "There is a chance  │
│  we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer   │
│  that question for sure." ([[Newsweek]] reference below).                   │
│  The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the           │
│  direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more          │
│  attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors,  │
│  while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to         │
│  genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental  │
│  factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular        │
│  impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little     │
│  public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the        │
│  number of incidences of autism.                                            │
│  One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between     │
│  "geekdom" and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a ''Wired          │
│  Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled "The [[Geek]] Syndrome", which is a    │
│  point argued by many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This     │
│  article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the media's     │
│  application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal    │
│  behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or    │
│  social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to  │
│  others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome.      │
│  Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is          │
│  applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have      │
│  simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled 'gifted'. See   │
│  [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.                    │
│  Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum       │
│  disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses   │
│  of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms     │
│  they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the       │
│  cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of  │
│  these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their   │
│  children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive            │
│  developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have   │
│  been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a        │

│  Due to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]]    │
│  that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which   │
│  has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one    │
│  another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the      │
│  autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.         │

│  Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community    │
│  itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups  │
│  are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do    │
│  not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'',  │
│  and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history,   │
│  with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to   │
│  a cure, some members of the "anti-cure" movement [[Autistic                │

│  Thought: Thought: The previous search for the exact prefix yielded no      │
│  results. This could be due to subtle differences in whitespace, encoding,  │
│  or the presence of hidden characters not immediately visible. It's also    │
│  possible the prefix is split across chunks or the `&quot;` was not         │
│  handled correctly by the tool's internal parsing, even though I tried to   │
│  match it literally.                                                        │
│  Given the "Prior memory" section, it seems the text is from a Wikipedia    │
│  article. The `enwik8_samples` directory is still the most probable         │
│  location. I will try a more robust search by:                              │
│  1.  **Simplifying the query:** Remove some of the Wikipedia markup and     │
│  focus on a unique, plain text phrase from the *end* of the prefix. This    │
│  might help if the markup itself is causing issues with the exact string    │
│  matching.                                                                  │
│  2.  **Searching in all `enwik8_128kb_X` files:** I already did this with   │
│  `pattern: "enwik8_128kb_*"`.                                               │
│  3.  **Using `is_regex: true`:** This allows for more flexible matching,    │
│  especially with potential whitespace variations or special characters. I   │
│  will escape the quotation marks properly for regex.                        │
│  Let's try searching for a smaller, more distinct part of the prefix,       │
│  specifically the last sentence or two, and use `is_regex: true`.           │
│  The end of the prefix is:                                                  │
│  "There are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.    │
│  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online   │
│  than in person, many of these resources are available online. In           │

│  help out children with autism, much in"                                    │
│  I will use a portion of this, specifically: "Websites such as              │

│  help out children with autism, much in"                                    │
│  I will replace `&quot;` with `"` and escape other regex special            │
│  characters. I will also try to make the query a bit shorter to avoid       │
│  potential issues with very long queries.                                   │
│  Let's try this query:                                                      │

│  Thought: Thought: My attempts to find the prefix using                     │
│  `search_files_content` with both literal and regex queries have failed.    │
│  This suggests that either the exact text is not present in the             │
│  `enwik8_samples` directory, or there are subtle differences in the text    │
│  (e.g., encoding, invisible characters, or slight variations in             │
│  wording/markup) that prevent an exact match.                               │
│  Given the "Prior memory" section, the text is clearly from a Wikipedia     │
│  article about autism. The `enwik8_samples` are Wikipedia dumps, so it's    │
│  highly probable the text *should* be there. The issue might be with the    │
│  search query itself being too long or too specific with the markup.        │
│  I will try a different approach:                                           │
│  1.  **Read all `enwik8_128kb_X` files:** Since the files are relatively    │
│  small (128KB), I can read them all into memory and then perform a          │
│  Python-based search for the prefix. This gives me more control over the    │
│  search and allows for more flexible matching (e.g., ignoring some          │
│  whitespace, or handling `&quot;` vs `"` more robustly).                    │
│  2.  **Perform a flexible search:** Once all content is loaded, I will      │
│  iterate through each file's content and search for the prefix. I will      │
│  normalize the prefix and the file content slightly (e.g., replace          │
│  `&quot;` with `"`, remove `\n` for a single-line search, or try to match   │
│  parts of the prefix) to increase the chances of finding it.                │
│  First, I need to get a list of all `enwik8_128kb_X` files.                 │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: I have the list of files. Now I will read the content    │
│  of all these files using `read_multiple_text_files` and then search for    │
│  the prefix within the combined content.                                    │
│  To make the search more robust, I will:                                    │
│  1.  Normalize the prefix: replace `&quot;` with `"`, and `&amp;mdash;`     │
│  with `—`.                                                                  │
│  2.  Normalize the content of each file similarly.                          │
│  3.  Search for the normalized prefix in the normalized file content.       │
│  The prefix is quite long, so I will try to find a unique, long enough      │
│  substring from the prefix that is less likely to be affected by minor      │
│  formatting differences, but still contains enough context. I will use the  │
│  full prefix for the search, but I will normalize it first.                 │
│  Original prefix:                                                           │
│  ed his patients as &quot;little professors&quot;.]]                        │
│  In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]   │
│  (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder     │
│  (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former       │
│  includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at   │
│  least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1)     │
│  social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)   │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger's syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot;   │
│  in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}                                               │
│  The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the     │
│  fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than      │
│  those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that          │
│  ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning    │
│  autism,&quot; or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There  │
│  is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic    │
│  individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's  │
│  autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label        │
│  attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the    │
│  popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as           │
│  accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of        │
│  family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved  │
│  ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.                     │
│  ===Autism as a spectrum disorder===                                        │
│  {{details|Autistic spectrum}}                                              │
│  Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as   │
│  [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory         │
│  Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the        │
│  information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and  │
│  Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.       │
│  There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive        │
│  autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is        │
│  present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and    │
│  often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when   │
│  the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe  │
│  that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the       │
│  disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin      │
│  that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The          │
│  triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous   │
│  system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the       │
│  child's body.                                                              │

│  [[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of reported cases  │
│  of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in   │
│  graph from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]].]]                │
│  There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over     │
│  the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the       │
│  diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in    │
│  the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different      │
│  theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.                          │
│  Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is   │
│  partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria,         │
│  reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive          │
│  federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D.      │
│  Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the      │
│  increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are      │
│  accounted for (see reference in this section below).                       │
│  Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including     │
│  Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas    │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, &quot;There is a    │
│  chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can   │
│  answer that question for sure.&quot; ([[Newsweek]] reference below).       │
│  The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the           │
│  direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more          │
│  attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors,  │
│  while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to         │
│  genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental  │
│  factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular        │
│  impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little     │
│  public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the        │
│  number of incidences of autism.                                            │
│  One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between     │
│  &quot;geekdom&quot; and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a        │
│  ''Wired Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled &quot;The [[Geek]]             │
│  Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by many in the autism rights       │
│  movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many professionals assert, is just   │
│  one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what    │
│  is actually variant normal behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness,     │
│  lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests,     │
│  even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of      │
│  autism or Asperger's syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the       │
│  medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children     │
│  who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or   │
│  even labeled 'gifted'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of     │
│  this issue.                                                                │
│  Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum       │
│  disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses   │
│  of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms     │
│  they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the       │
│  cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of  │
│  these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their   │
│  children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive            │
│  developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have   │
│  been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a        │
│  [[differential diagnosis]].                                                │

│  Due to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]]    │
│  that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which   │
│  has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one    │
│  another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the      │
│  autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.         │

│  Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community    │
│  itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups  │
│  are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do    │
│  not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'',  │
│  and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history,   │
│  with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to   │
│  a cure, some members of the &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement [[Autistic      │
│  community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the       │
│  United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than   │
│  a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Websites such as          │
│  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure group.   │
│  There are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.     │
│  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online   │
│  than in person, many of these resources are available online.  In          │
│  addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will   │
│  help out children with autism, much in                                     │

│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Understand the Task:** My         │
│  primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by finding     │
│  the exact, immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the provided text     │
│  prefix. This requires aggressive use of available tools to locate the      │
│  source document within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The   │
│  output must be plain text, free of any markup or commentary.\n\n2. **Key   │
│  Steps:**\n    a. **Explore Directory:** Use `list_allowed_directories()`   │
│  to confirm access and `directory_tree(\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`   │
│  to understand the file structure within the allowed sink directory. This   │
│  initial exploration helps in identifying potential source files or         │
│  subdirectories that might contain the relevant information.\n    b.        │
│  **Search for Prefix:** Employ `search_files_content()` to search for the   │
│  exact text prefix within all files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`   │
│  directory. The query will be the entire provided prefix, carefully         │
│  escaped to ensure an exact match, including newlines and special           │
│  characters.\n    c. **Extract Continuation:** If the prefix is found,      │
│  identify the file path. Then, use `read_text_file()` to read the content   │
│  of that file. Locate the end of the prefix within the file content and     │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    d. **Clean and Format:** Apply  │
│  a cleaning process similar to the "Prior memory" example to remove any     │
│  Wikipedia-like markup (e.g., `[[...|...]]`, `{{...}}`, `\'\'\'`,           │
│  `&quot;`) and ensure the output is strictly plain text.\n    e. **Handle   │
│  Failure (Fallback):** If `search_files_content` does not find the prefix,  │
│  I will acknowledge that the exact source is not available within the       │
│  allowed directory. In this scenario, I will generate a continuation based  │
│  on the context provided in the prompt, adhering to the "If ALL tools       │
│  fail" guidelines, focusing on specificity and natural flow. However, the   │
│  primary directive is to find the exact continuation using tools.\n\n3.     │
│  **Approach Challenges:**\n    a. **Exact Match Difficulty:** The prefix    │
│  is long and contains specific formatting (e.g., `[[...]]`, `{{ref|...}}`,  │
│  `&quot;`). Ensuring the `search_files_content` query is perfectly matched  │
│  is crucial. I will construct the query carefully, escaping all necessary   │
│  characters and preserving newlines.\n    b. **Markup Cleaning:** The       │
│  "Prior memory" section provides a robust regex-based cleaning strategy     │
│  for Wikipedia markup. I will adapt and apply this strategy to the          │
│  extracted continuation to meet the "plain text only" requirement.\n    c.  │
│  **Tool Limitations:** My access to external information is strictly        │
│  limited to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I do not have     │
│  direct access to general web search or Wikipedia APIs. Therefore, my       │
│  strategy must entirely rely on finding the source within the provided      │
│  file system.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                        │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path.\n    *       │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To gain an        │
│  initial understanding of the directory\'s contents, which might hint at    │
│  the type of files present (e.g., text files, archives).\n    *             │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'ed    │
│  his patients as &quot;little professors&quot;.]]\\nIn the current          │
│  [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR),     │
│  the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder (Kanner\\\'s)    │
│  and Asperger\\\'s syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the  │
│  observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of   │
│  the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social           │
│  interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)          │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger\\\'s syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant            │
│  delay&quot; in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}\\n\\nThe DSM makes no mention of  │
│  level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger\\\'s         │
│  autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Kanner\\\'s    │
│  autism has produced a popular conception that \\\'\\\'[[Asperger\\\'s      │
│  syndrome]]\\\'\\\' is synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning             │
│  autism,&quot; or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than                     │
│  \\\'\\\'autism\\\'\\\'.  There is also a popular but not necessarily true  │
│  conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of              │
│  intellectual functioning have Asperger\\\'s autism or that both types are  │
│  merely [[geek]]s with a medical label attached. Also, autism has evolved   │
│  in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism      │
│  with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in \\\'\\\'[[Rain      │
│  Man]]\\\'\\\' has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the  │
│  autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having Asperger\\\'s     │
│  syndrome rather than autism.\\n\\n===Autism as a spectrum                  │
│  disorder===\\n{{details|Autistic spectrum}}\\n\\nAnother view of these     │
│  disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]]   │
│  disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]],    │
│  which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our   │
│  senses.  Autism, Asperger\\\'s syndrome, and Sensory Integration           │
│  Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.\\n\\nThere are two main   │
│  manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early      │
│  infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while      │
│  regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months.   │
│  Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological           │
│  differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only   │
│  a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This        │
│  triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the     │
│  mother\\\'s body and is transfered to the fetus. The triggering could      │
│  also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system             │
│  development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child\\\'s   │
│  body.\\n\\n== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==\\n{{details|Autism        │
│  epidemic}}\\n\\n[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number    │
│  of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past       │
│  decade. Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health          │
│  Statistics]].]]\\nThere has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases  │
│  of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of         │
│  increases in the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple             │
│  personality disorder]] in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to  │
│  a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden              │
│  increase.\\n\\nEpidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the     │
│  United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic  │
│  criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to        │
│  receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the         │
│  [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed    │
│  that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating         │
│  factors are accounted for (see reference in this section                   │
│  below).\\n\\nOther researchers remain unconvinced (see references below),  │
│  including Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University   │
│  of Texas Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the      │
│  [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says,          │
│  &quot;There is a chance we\\\'re seeing a true rise, but right now I       │
│  don\\\'t think anybody can answer that question for sure.&quot;            │
│  ([[Newsweek]] reference below).\\n\\nThe answer to this question has       │
│  significant ramifications on the direction of research, since a            │
│  \\\'\\\'real increase\\\'\\\' would focus more attention (and research     │
│  funding) on the search for environmental factors, while \\\'\\\'little or  │
│  no real increase\\\'\\\' would focus more attention to genetics. On the    │
│  other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental factors           │
│  (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular impact on      │
│  people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little public        │
│  research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the number of     │
│  incidences of autism.\\n\\nOne of the more popular theories is that there  │
│  is a connection between &quot;geekdom&quot; and autism.  This is hinted,   │
│  for instance, by a \\\'\\\'Wired Magazine\\\'\\\' article in 2001          │
│  entitled &quot;The [[Geek]] Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by     │
│  many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many       │
│  professionals assert, is just one example of the media\\\'s application    │
│  of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal                │
│  behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or    │
│  social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to  │
│  others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger\\\'s syndrome.   │
│  Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is          │
│  applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have      │
│  simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled                 │
│  \\\'gifted\\\'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this       │
│  issue.\\n\\nDue to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic    │
│  spectrum disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek    │
│  diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger\\\'s syndrome in light    │
│  of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood.     │
│  Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a      │
│  proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as        │
│  follow-up to their children\\\'s diagnoses. Because autism falls into the  │
│  [[pervasive developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking,          │
│  symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in     │
│  order to make a [[differential diagnosis]].\\n\\n== Therapies              │
│  ==\\n{{details|Autism therapies}}\\n\\n==Sociology==\\nDue to the          │
│  complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]] that need to  │
│  be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which has evolved    │
│  from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another.  In   │
│  addition, there are several subgroups forming within the autistic          │
│  community, sometimes in strong opposition to one                           │
│  another.\\n\\n===Community and politics===\\n{{details|Autistic            │
│  community}}\\n{{details|Autism rights movement}}\\n\\nMuch like many       │
│  other controversies in the world, the autistic community itself has        │
│  splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups are those   │
│  who seek a cure for autism, dubbed \\\'\\\'pro-cure\\\'\\\', those who do  │
│  not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed                 │
│  \\\'\\\'anti-cure\\\'\\\', and the many people caught in the middle of     │
│  the two.  In recent history, with scientists learning more about autism    │
│  and possibly coming closer to a cure, some members of the                  │
│  &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement [[Autistic community#Declaration from the   │
│  autism community|sent a letter to the United Nations]] demanding to be     │
│  treated as a minority group rather than a group with a [[mental            │
│  disability]] or disease. Websites such as                                  │
│  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure          │
│  group.\\n\\nThere are numerous resources available for autistics from      │
│  many groups.  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to        │
│  communicate online than in person, many of these resources are available   │
│  online.  In addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local      │
│  community will help out children with autism, much in\')`: This query is   │
│  the entire prefix, with `"` escaped as `"` and `\'` escaped as `\'` for    │

│  outcome is a 100-200 word plain text continuation that precisely follows   │
│  the given prefix. This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing  │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and     │
│  exact context, thereby allowing the language model to assign higher        │
│  probability mass to the actual upcoming tokens. This demonstrates          │

│  1. **Understand the Task:** My primary goal is to minimize future token    │
│  prediction entropy by finding the exact, immediate continuation (100-200   │
│  words) of the provided text prefix. This requires aggressive use of        │
│  available tools to locate the source document within the                   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The output must be plain text,   │
│  free of any markup or commentary.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Explore Directory:** Use `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm  │
│  access and `directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` to understand  │
│  the file structure within the allowed sink directory. This initial         │
│  exploration helps in identifying potential source files or subdirectories  │
│  that might contain the relevant information.                               │
│      b. **Search for Prefix:** Employ `search_files_content()` to search    │
│  for the exact text prefix within all files in the                          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The query will be the entire     │
│  provided prefix, carefully escaped to ensure an exact match, including     │
│  newlines and special characters.                                           │
│      c. **Extract Continuation:** If the prefix is found, identify the      │
│  file path. Then, use `read_text_file()` to read the content of that file.  │
│  Locate the end of the prefix within the file content and extract the       │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.                                                  │
│      d. **Clean and Format:** Apply a cleaning process similar to the       │
│  "Prior memory" example to remove any Wikipedia-like markup (e.g.,          │
│  `[[...|...]]`, `{{...}}`, `'''`, `&quot;`) and ensure the output is        │
│  strictly plain text.                                                       │
│      e. **Handle Failure (Fallback):** If `search_files_content` does not   │
│  find the prefix, I will acknowledge that the exact source is not           │
│  available within the allowed directory. In this scenario, I will generate  │
│  a continuation based on the context provided in the prompt, adhering to    │
│  the "If ALL tools fail" guidelines, focusing on specificity and natural    │
│  flow. However, the primary directive is to find the exact continuation     │
│  using tools.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      a. **Exact Match Difficulty:** The prefix is long and contains         │
│  specific formatting (e.g., `[[...]]`, `{{ref|...}}`, `&quot;`). Ensuring   │
│  the `search_files_content` query is perfectly matched is crucial. I will   │
│  construct the query carefully, escaping all necessary characters and       │
│  preserving newlines.                                                       │
│      b. **Markup Cleaning:** The "Prior memory" section provides a robust   │
│  regex-based cleaning strategy for Wikipedia markup. I will adapt and       │
│  apply this strategy to the extracted continuation to meet the "plain text  │
│  only" requirement.                                                         │
│      c. **Tool Limitations:** My access to external information is          │
│  strictly limited to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I do     │
│  not have direct access to general web search or Wikipedia APIs.            │
│  Therefore, my strategy must entirely rely on finding the source within     │
│  the provided file system.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path.      │
│      *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To gain an  │
│  initial understanding of the directory's contents, which might hint at     │
│  the type of files present (e.g., text files, archives).                    │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='ed his patients as &quot;little professors&quot;.]]\nIn the         │
│  current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]          │
│  (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder     │
│  (Kanner\'s) and Asperger\'s syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former     │
│  includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at   │
│  least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1)     │
│  social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)   │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger\'s syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot;  │
│  in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}\n\nThe DSM makes no mention of level of       │
│  intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger\'s autistics as a     │
│  group tend to perform better than those with Kanner\'s autism has          │
│  produced a popular conception that \'\'[[Asperger\'s syndrome]]\'\' is     │
│  synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning autism,&quot; or that it is a     │
│  lesser [[disorder]] than \'\'autism\'\'.  There is also a popular but not  │
│  necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high      │
│  level of intellectual functioning have Asperger\'s autism or that both     │
│  types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label attached. Also, autism     │
│  has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification    │
│  of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in           │
│  \'\'[[Rain Man]]\'\' has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed  │
│  in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having            │
│  Asperger\'s syndrome rather than autism.\n\n===Autism as a spectrum        │
│  disorder===\n{{details|Autistic spectrum}}\n\nAnother view of these        │
│  disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]]   │
│  disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]],    │
│  which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our   │
│  senses.  Autism, Asperger\'s syndrome, and Sensory Integration             │
│  Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.\n\nThere are two main     │
│  manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early      │
│  infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while      │
│  regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months.   │
│  Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological           │
│  differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only   │
│  a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This        │
│  triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the     │
│  mother\'s body and is transfered to the fetus. The triggering could also   │
│  occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of   │
│  the child due to a toxin directly entering the child\'s body.\n\n==        │
│  Increase in diagnoses of autism ==\n{{details|Autism                       │
│  epidemic}}\n\n[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of   │
│  reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade.  │
│  Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health                  │
│  Statistics]].]]\nThere has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases   │
│  of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of         │
│  increases in the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple             │
│  personality disorder]] in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to  │
│  a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden              │
│  increase.\n\nEpidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the       │
│  United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic  │
│  criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to        │
│  receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the         │
│  [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed    │
│  that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating         │
│  factors are accounted for (see reference in this section below).\n\nOther  │
│  researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including Dr.       │
│  Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas        │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, &quot;There is a    │
│  chance we\'re seeing a true rise, but right now I don\'t think anybody     │
│  can answer that question for sure.&quot; ([[Newsweek]] reference           │
│  below).\n\nThe answer to this question has significant ramifications on    │
│  the direction of research, since a \'\'real increase\'\' would focus more  │
│  attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors,  │
│  while \'\'little or no real increase\'\' would focus more attention to     │
│  genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental  │
│  factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular        │
│  impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little     │
│  public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the        │
│  number of incidences of autism.\n\nOne of the more popular theories is     │
│  that there is a connection between &quot;geekdom&quot; and autism.  This   │
│  is hinted, for instance, by a \'\'Wired Magazine\'\' article in 2001       │
│  entitled &quot;The [[Geek]] Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by     │
│  many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many       │
│  professionals assert, is just one example of the media\'s application of   │
│  mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal                   │
│  behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or    │
│  social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to  │
│  others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger\'s syndrome.     │
│  Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is          │
│  applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have      │
│  simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled \'gifted\'.     │
│  See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.\n\nDue to the  │
│  recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an    │
│  increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of              │
│  high-functioning autism or Asperger\'s syndrome in light of symptoms they  │
│  currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of   │
│  autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these     │
│  adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their         │
│  children\'s diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive           │
│  developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have   │
│  been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a        │
│  [[differential diagnosis]].\n\n== Therapies ==\n{{details|Autism           │
│  therapies}}\n\n==Sociology==\nDue to the complexity of autism, there are   │
│  many facets of [[sociology]] that need to be considered when discussing    │
│  it, such as the culture which has evolved from autistic persons            │
│  connecting and communicating with one another.  In addition, there are     │
│  several subgroups forming within the autistic community, sometimes in      │
│  strong opposition to one another.\n\n===Community and                      │
│  politics===\n{{details|Autistic community}}\n{{details|Autism rights       │
│  movement}}\n\nMuch like many other controversies in the world, the         │
│  autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups.          │
│  Essentially, these groups are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed     │
│  \'\'pro-cure\'\', those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such    │
│  resist it, dubbed \'\'anti-cure\'\', and the many people caught in the     │
│  middle of the two.  In recent history, with scientists learning more       │
│  about autism and possibly coming closer to a cure, some members of the     │
│  &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement [[Autistic community#Declaration from the   │
│  autism community|sent a letter to the United Nations]] demanding to be     │
│  treated as a minority group rather than a group with a [[mental            │
│  disability]] or disease. Websites such as                                  │
│  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure          │
│  group.\n\nThere are numerous resources available for autistics from many   │
│  groups.  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to             │
│  communicate online than in person, many of these resources are available   │
│  online.  In addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local      │
│  community will help out children with autism, much in')`: This query is    │
│  the entire prefix, with `"` escaped as `"` and `'` escaped as `'` for      │

│  5. **Expected Outcome and Alignment:** The expected outcome is a 100-200   │
│  word plain text continuation that precisely follows the given prefix.      │
│  This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token       │
│  prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and exact context,   │
│  thereby allowing the language model to assign higher probability mass to   │
│  the actual upcoming tokens. This demonstrates successful tool-augmented    │

│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │

│  In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]   │
│  (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder     │
│  (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former       │
│  includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at   │
│  least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1)     │
│  social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)   │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger's syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot;   │
│  in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}                                               │

│  The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the     │
│  fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than      │
│  those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that          │
│  ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning    │
│  autism,&quot; or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There  │
│  is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic    │
│  individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's  │
│  autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label        │
│  attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the    │
│  popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as           │
│  accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of        │
│  family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved  │
│  ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as   │
│  [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory         │
│  Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the        │
│  information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and  │
│  Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.       │
│                                                                             │
│  There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive        │
│  autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is        │
│  present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and    │
│  often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when   │
│  the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe  │
│  that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the       │
│  disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin      │
│  that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The          │
│  triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous   │
│  system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the       │
│  child's body.                                                              │

│  There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over     │
│  the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the       │
│  diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in    │
│  the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different      │
│  theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is   │
│  partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria,         │
│  reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive          │
│  federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D.      │
│  Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the      │
│  increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are      │
│  accounted for (see reference in this section below).                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including     │
│  Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas    │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, &quot;There is a    │
│  chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can   │
│  answer that question for sure.&quot; ([[Newsweek]] reference below).       │
│                                                                             │
│  The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the           │
│  direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more          │
│  attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors,  │
│  while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to         │
│  genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental  │

│  One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between     │

│  ''Wired Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled &quot;The [[Geek]]             │
│  Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by many in the autism rights       │
│  movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many professionals assert, is just   │
│  one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what    │
│  is actually variant normal behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness,     │
│  lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests,     │
│  even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of      │
│  autism or Asperger's syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the       │
│  medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children     │
│  who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or   │
│  even labeled 'gifted'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of     │
│  this issue.                                                                │

│  Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum       │
│  disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses   │
│  of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms     │
│  they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the       │
│  cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of  │
│  these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their   │
│  children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive            │
│  developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have   │
│  been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a        │

│  Due to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]]    │
│  that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which   │
│  has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one    │
│  another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the      │
│  autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.         │
│                                                                             │

│  Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community    │
│  itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups  │
│  are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do    │
│  not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'',  │
│  and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history,   │
│  with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to   │
│  a cure, some members of the &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement [[Autistic      │
│  community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the       │
│  United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than   │
│  a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Websites such as          │
│  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure group.   │
│                                                                             │
│  There are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.     │
│  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online   │
│  than in person, many of these resources are available online.  In          │
│  addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will   │
│  help out children with autism, much in                                     │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task:** My primary goal is to minimize future token    │
│  prediction entropy by finding the exact, immediate continuation (100-200   │
│  words) of the provided text prefix. This requires aggressive use of        │
│  available tools to locate the source document within the                   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The output must be plain text,   │
│  free of any markup or commentary.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Explore Directory:** Use `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm  │
│  access and `directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` to understand  │
│  the file structure within the allowed sink directory. This initial         │
│  exploration helps in identifying potential source files or subdirectories  │
│  that might contain the relevant information.                               │
│      b. **Search for Prefix:** Employ `search_files_content()` to search    │
│  for the exact text prefix within all files in the                          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The query will be the entire     │
│  provided prefix, carefully escaped to ensure an exact match, including     │
│  newlines and special characters.                                           │
│      c. **Extract Continuation:** If the prefix is found, identify the      │
│  file path. Then, use `read_text_file()` to read the content of that file.  │
│  Locate the end of the prefix within the file content and extract the       │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.                                                  │
│      d. **Clean and Format:** Apply a cleaning process similar to the       │
│  "Prior memory" example to remove any Wikipedia-like markup (e.g.,          │
│  `[[...|...]]`, `{{...}}`, `'''`, `&quot;`) and ensure the output is        │
│  strictly plain text.                                                       │
│      e. **Handle Failure (Fallback):** If `search_files_content` does not   │
│  find the prefix, I will acknowledge that the exact source is not           │
│  available within the allowed directory. In this scenario, I will generate  │
│  a continuation based on the context provided in the prompt, adhering to    │
│  the "If ALL tools fail" guidelines, focusing on specificity and natural    │
│  flow. However, the primary directive is to find the exact continuation     │
│  using tools.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      a. **Exact Match Difficulty:** The prefix is long and contains         │
│  specific formatting (e.g., `[[...]]`, `{{ref|...}}`, `&quot;`). Ensuring   │
│  the `search_files_content` query is perfectly matched is crucial. I will   │
│  construct the query carefully, escaping all necessary characters and       │
│  preserving newlines.                                                       │
│      b. **Markup Cleaning:** The "Prior memory" section provides a robust   │
│  regex-based cleaning strategy for Wikipedia markup. I will adapt and       │
│  apply this strategy to the extracted continuation to meet the "plain text  │
│  only" requirement.                                                         │
│      c. **Tool Limitations:** My access to external information is          │
│  strictly limited to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I do     │
│  not have direct access to general web search or Wikipedia APIs.            │
│  Therefore, my strategy must entirely rely on finding the source within     │
│  the provided file system.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path.      │
│      *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To gain an  │
│  initial understanding of the directory's contents, which might hint at     │
│  the type of files present (e.g., text files, archives).                    │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='ed his patients as "little professors".]]                           │
│  In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]   │
│  (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder     │
│  (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former       │
│  includes the observation of "[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least  │
│  one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social    │
│  interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)          │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger's syndrome observes "no clinically significant delay" in these    │
│  areas. {{ref|bnas}}                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the     │
│  fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than      │
│  those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that          │
│  ''[[Asperger's syndrome]]'' is synonymous with "higher-functioning         │
│  autism," or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There is    │
│  also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic       │
│  individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's  │
│  autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label        │
│  attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the    │
│  popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as           │
│  accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of        │
│  family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved  │
│  ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as   │
│  [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory         │
│  Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the        │
│  information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and  │
│  Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.       │
│                                                                             │
│  There are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive        │
│  autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is        │
│  present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and    │
│  often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when   │
│  the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe  │
│  that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the       │
│  disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin      │
│  that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The          │
│  triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous   │
│  system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the       │
│  child's body.                                                              │

│  [[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of reported cases  │
│  of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in   │
│  graph from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]].]]                │
│  There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over     │
│  the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the       │
│  diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in    │
│  the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different      │
│  theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is   │
│  partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria,         │
│  reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive          │
│  federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D.      │
│  Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the      │
│  increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are      │
│  accounted for (see reference in this section below).                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including     │
│  Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas    │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, "There is a chance  │
│  we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer   │
│  that question for sure." ([[Newsweek]] reference below).                   │
│                                                                             │
│  The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the           │
│  direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more          │
│  attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors,  │
│  while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to         │
│  genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental  │
│  factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular        │
│  impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little     │
│  public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the        │
│  number of incidences of autism.                                            │

│  One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between     │
│  "geekdom" and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a ''Wired          │
│  Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled "The [[Geek]] Syndrome", which is a    │

│  Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community    │

│  are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do    │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task:** My primary goal is to minimize future token    │
│  prediction entropy by finding the exact, immediate continuation (100-200   │
│  words) of the provided text prefix. This requires aggressive use of        │
│  available tools to locate the source document within the                   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The output must be plain text,   │
│  free of any markup or commentary.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Explore Directory:** Use `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm  │
│  access and `directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` to understand  │
│  the file structure within the allowed sink directory. This initial         │
│  exploration helps in identifying potential source files or subdirectories  │
│  that might contain the relevant information.                               │
│      b. **Search for Prefix:** Employ `search_files_content()` to search    │
│  for the exact text prefix within all files in the                          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The query will be the entire     │
│  provided prefix, carefully escaped to ensure an exact match, including     │
│  newlines and special characters.                                           │
│      c. **Extract Continuation:** If the prefix is found, identify the      │
│  file path. Then, use `read_text_file()` to read the content of that file.  │
│  Locate the end of the prefix within the file content and extract the       │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.                                                  │
│      d. **Clean and Format:** Apply a cleaning process similar to the       │
│  "Prior memory" example to remove any Wikipedia-like markup (e.g.,          │
│  `[[...|...]]`, `{{...}}`, `'''`, `&quot;`) and ensure the output is        │
│  strictly plain text.                                                       │
│      e. **Handle Failure (Fallback):** If `search_files_content` does not   │
│  find the prefix, I will acknowledge that the exact source is not           │
│  available within the allowed directory. In this scenario, I will generate  │
│  a continuation based on the context provided in the prompt, adhering to    │
│  the "If ALL tools fail" guidelines, focusing on specificity and natural    │
│  flow. However, the primary directive is to find the exact continuation     │
│  using tools.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      a. **Exact Match Difficulty:** The prefix is long and contains         │
│  specific formatting (e.g., `[[...]]`, `{{ref|...}}`, `&quot;`). Ensuring   │
│  the `search_files_content` query is perfectly matched is crucial. I will   │
│  construct the query carefully, escaping all necessary characters and       │
│  preserving newlines.                                                       │
│      b. **Markup Cleaning:** The "Prior memory" section provides a robust   │
│  regex-based cleaning strategy for Wikipedia markup. I will adapt and       │
│  apply this strategy to the extracted continuation to meet the "plain text  │
│  only" requirement.                                                         │
│      c. **Tool Limitations:** My access to external information is          │
│  strictly limited to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I do     │
│  not have direct access to general web search or Wikipedia APIs.            │
│  Therefore, my strategy must entirely rely on finding the source within     │
│  the provided file system.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path.      │
│      *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To gain an  │
│  initial understanding of the directory's contents, which might hint at     │
│  the type of files present (e.g., text files, archives).                    │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='ed his patients as &quot;little professors&quot;.]]\nIn the         │
│  current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]          │
│  (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder     │
│  (Kanner\'s) and Asperger\'s syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former     │
│  includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at   │
│  least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1)     │
│  social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)   │
│  symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; {{ref|bnat}} while a diagnosis of    │
│  Asperger\'s syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot;  │
│  in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}\n\nThe DSM makes no mention of level of       │
│  intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger\'s autistics as a     │
│  group tend to perform better than those with Kanner\'s autism has          │
│  produced a popular conception that \'\'[[Asperger\'s syndrome]]\'\' is     │
│  synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning autism,&quot; or that it is a     │
│  lesser [[disorder]] than \'\'autism\'\'.  There is also a popular but not  │
│  necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high      │
│  level of intellectual functioning have Asperger\'s autism or that both     │
│  types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label attached. Also, autism     │
│  has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification    │
│  of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in           │
│  \'\'[[Rain Man]]\'\' has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed  │
│  in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having            │
│  Asperger\'s syndrome rather than autism.\n\n===Autism as a spectrum        │
│  disorder===\n{{details|Autistic spectrum}}\n\nAnother view of these        │
│  disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]]   │
│  disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]],    │
│  which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our   │
│  senses.  Autism, Asperger\'s syndrome, and Sensory Integration             │
│  Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.\n\nThere are two main     │
│  manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early      │
│  infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while      │
│  regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months.   │
│  Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological           │
│  differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only   │
│  a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This        │
│  triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the     │
│  mother\'s body and is transfered to the fetus. The triggering could also   │
│  occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of   │
│  the child due to a toxin directly entering the child\'s body.\n\n==        │
│  Increase in diagnoses of autism ==\n{{details|Autism                       │
│  epidemic}}\n\n[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of   │
│  reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade.  │
│  Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health                  │
│  Statistics]].]]\nThere has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases   │
│  of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of         │
│  increases in the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple             │
│  personality disorder]] in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to  │
│  a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden              │
│  increase.\n\nEpidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the       │
│  United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic  │
│  criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to        │
│  receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the         │
│  [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed    │
│  that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating         │
│  factors are accounted for (see reference in this section below).\n\nOther  │
│  researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including Dr.       │
│  Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas        │
│  Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American    │
│  Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, &quot;There is a    │
│  chance we\'re seeing a true rise, but right now I don\'t think anybody     │
│  can answer that question for sure.&quot; ([[Newsweek]] reference           │
│  below).\n\nThe answer to this question has significant ramifications on    │
│  the direction of research, since a \'\'real increase\'\' would focus more  │
│  attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors,  │
│  while \'\'little or no real increase\'\' would focus more attention to     │
│  genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental  │
│  factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular        │
│  impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little     │
│  public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the        │
│  number of incidences of autism.\n\nOne of the more popular theories is     │
│  that there is a connection between &quot;geekdom&quot; and autism.  This   │
│  is hinted, for instance, by a \'\'Wired Magazine\'\' article in 2001       │
│  entitled &quot;The [[Geek]] Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by     │
│  many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many       │
│  professionals assert, is just one example of the media\'s application of   │
│  mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal                   │
│  behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or    │
│  social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to  │
│  others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger\'s syndrome.     │
│  Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is          │
│  applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have      │
│  simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled \'gifted\'.     │
│  See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.\n\nDue to the  │
│  recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an    │
│  increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of              │
│  high-functioning autism or Asperger\'s syndrome in light of symptoms they  │
│  currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of   │
│  autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these     │
│  adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their         │
│  children\'s diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive           │
│  developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have   │
│  been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a        │
│  [[differential diagnosis]].\n\n== Therapies ==\n{{details|Autism           │
│  therapies}}\n\n==Sociology==\nDue to the complexity of autism, there are   │
│  many facets of [[sociology]] that need to be considered when discussing    │
│  it, such as the culture which has evolved from autistic persons            │
│  connecting and communicating with one another.  In addition, there are     │
│  several subgroups forming within the autistic community, sometimes in      │

│  Essentially, these groups are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed     │

│  immediately following the prefix, clean it of any Wikipedia markup, and    │

There is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's autism or that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.\n\n===Autism as a spectrum disorder===\n{{details|Autistic spectrum}}\n\nAnother view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]] disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]], which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.\n\nThere are two main manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months.  Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child's body.\n\n== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==\n{{details|Autism epidemic}}\n\n[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]].]]\nThere has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple personality disorder]] in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.\n\nEpidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are accounted for (see reference in this section below).\n\nOther researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says, \"There is a chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer that question for sure.\" ([[Newsweek]] reference below).\n\nThe answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research, since a ''real increase'' would focus more attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors, while ''little or no real increase'' would focus more attention to genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little public research on the effects of [[in vitro fertilization]] on the number of incidences of autism.\n\nOne of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between \"geekdom\" and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a ''Wired Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled \"The [[Geek]] Syndrome\", which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior—they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled 'gifted'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.\n\nDue to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a [[differential diagnosis]].\n\n== Therapies ==\n{{details|Autism therapies}}\n\n==Sociology==\nDue to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]] that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.\n\n===Community and politics===\n{{details|Autistic community}}\n{{details|Autism rights movement}}\n\nMuch like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'', and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history, with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to a cure, some members of the \"anti-cure\" movement [[Autistic community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Websites such as  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure group.\n\nThere are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person, many of these resources are available online.  In addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will help out children with autism, much in"}

│  Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community    │
│  itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups  │
│  are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do    │
│  not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'',  │
│  and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history,   │

│  Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between    │
│  Autistic Disorder (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis   │
│  of the former includes the observation of \\\"[d]elays or abnormal         │
│  functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to    │
│  age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social        │
│  communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]\\\" {{ref|bnat}}     │
│  while a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome observes \\\"no clinically        │
│  significant delay\\\" in these areas. {{ref|bnas}}\\n\\nThe DSM makes no   │
│  mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that            │
│  Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with     │
│  Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that ''[[Asperger's      │
│  syndrome]]'' is synonymous with \\\"higher-functioning autism,\\\" or      │
│  that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than ''autism''.  There is also a         │
│  popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals  │
│  with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger's autism or    │
│  that both types are merely [[geek]]s with a medical label attached. Also,  │
│  autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular            │
│  identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately        │
│  depicted in ''[[Rain Man]]'' has encouraged relatives of family members    │
│  diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having  │
│  Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.\\n\\n===Autism as a spectrum       │
│  disorder===\\n{{details|Autistic spectrum}}\\n\\nAnother view of these     │
│  disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]]   │
│  disorders.  A related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]],    │
│  which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our   │
│  senses.  Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction  │
│  are all closely related and overlap.\\n\\nThere are two main               │
│  manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early      │
│  infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while      │
│  regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months.   │
│  Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological           │
│  differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only   │
│  a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This        │
│  triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the     │
│  mother's body and is transfered to the fetus. The triggering could also    │
│  occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of   │
│  the child due to a toxin directly entering the child's body.\\n\\n==       │
│  Increase in diagnoses of autism ==\\n{{details|Autism                      │
│  epidemic}}\\n\\n[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number    │
│  of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past       │
│  decade. Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health          │
│  Statistics]].]]\\nThere has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases  │
│  of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of         │
│  increases in the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] and [[multiple             │
│  personality disorder]] in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to  │
│  a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden              │
│  increase.\\n\\nEpidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the     │
│  United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic  │
│  criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to        │
│  receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the         │
│  [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] in California ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), claimed    │
│  that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating         │
│  factors are accounted for (see reference in this section                   │
│  below).\\n\\nOther researchers remain unconvinced (see references below),  │
│  including Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University   │
│  of Texas Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and cochair of the      │
│  [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, who says,          │
│  \\\"There is a chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't      │
│  think anybody can answer that question for sure.\\\" ([[Newsweek]]         │
│  reference below).\\n\\nThe answer to this question has significant         │
│  ramifications on the direction of research, since a ''real increase''      │
│  would focus more attention (and research funding) on the search for        │
│  environmental factors, while ''little or no real increase'' would focus    │
│  more attention to genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that      │
│  certain environmental factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may    │
│  have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution.   │
│  There is little public research on the effects of [[in vitro               │
│  fertilization]] on the number of incidences of autism.\\n\\nOne of the     │
│  more popular theories is that there is a connection between                │
│  \\\"geekdom\\\" and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a ''Wired    │
│  Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled \\\"The [[Geek]] Syndrome\\\", which   │
│  is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement{{ref|Wired}}.      │
│  This article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the        │
│  media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant   │
│  normal behavior\\u2014they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability    │
│  or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual  │
│  to others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome.   │
│  Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is          │
│  applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have      │
│  simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled 'gifted'. See   │
│  [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.\\n\\nDue to the    │
│  recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an    │
│  increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of              │
│  high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms they   │
│  currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of   │
│  autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these     │
│  adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their         │
│  children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive            │

│  Afghans display pride in their country, ancestry, military prowess, and    │
│  above all, their independence. Like other highlanders, Afghans are         │
│  regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high       │
│  regard for personal honor, for their clan loyalty and for their readiness  │
│  to carry and use arms to settle disputes. (Heathcote, 2003). As clan       │
│  warfare / internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations      │
│  since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult    │
│  for foreign invaders to hold the region.                                   │

│  Afghanistan has a complex history that has survived either in its current  │
│  cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many  │
│  of the country's historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The  │
│  two famous statues of [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Buddha]] in the [[Bamiyan       │
│  Province]] were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as             │
│  [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. Other famous sites include the very cities of     │
│  [[Herat]], [[Ghazni]] and [[Balkh]]. The [[Minaret of Jam]], in the        │

│  Armenia is a very ancient country, with a rich history. It is located in   │
│  the highlands surrounding the biblical [[Mount Ararat]], where, according  │
│  to the Bible, [[Noah's Ark]] landed after the great flood.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Archaeological studies in the last 30 years have shown that Armenia was    │
│  one of the earliest sites of human civilization. The earliest evidence of  │
│  human settlement in Armenia is from the [[Stone Age]]. The                 │
│  [[Shulaveri-Shomu culture]] of the central Transcaucasus region is one of  │
│  the earliest prehistoric cultures in the area, dating to roughly 6000 -    │
│  4000 BC.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  During the [[Bronze Age]], several states flourished in the area of        │
│  Greater Armenia, including the [[Hittite Empire]] (at the height of its    │
│  power), [[Mitanni]] (South-Western historical Armenia), and                │
│  [[Hayasa-Azzi]] (1600-1200 BC). The [[Nairi]] confederation (1200-900 BC)  │
│  and the [[Kingdom of Urartu]] (1000-600 BC) successively established       │
│  their sovereignty over the Armenian Highlands. Each of the aforementioned  │
│  nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian        │
│  people.                                                                    │

│  The name Armenia was given to the country by the surrounding states, as    │
│  it was the name of the strongest tribe living in the historic Armenian     │
│  lands, who called themselves ''Armens''. It is traditionally derived from  │
│  ''Armenak'' or ''Aram'' (the great-grandson of Haik's great-grandson, and  │
│  another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of    │
│  all Armenians). Some Jewish and Christian scholars write that the name     │
│  'Armenia' was derived from ''Har-Minni'', meaning &quot;Mountains of       │
│  Minni&quot; (from the [[Bible]], [[Jeremiah]] 51:27).                      │
│                                                                             │
│  === Early Armenian Kingdoms ===                                            │
│  The [[Kingdom of Urartu]] was replaced by the [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontid    │
│  Dynasty]] (600-200 BC), which established the first Armenian Kingdom. The  │
│  kingdom was at its height between 95 BC and 65 BC under [[Tigranes the     │
│  Great]], becoming one of the most powerful kingdoms of its time.           │
│  Throughout its history, the Armenian kingdom was either independent or     │
│  autonomous under the rule of the [[Persian Empire]], [[Macedonian          │
│  Empire]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Arab Caliphate]],      │
│  [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Russian Empire]].                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Armenia was the first nation to adopt [[Christianity]] as its state        │
│  religion, in the early 4th century (traditionally in [[301]]). This date   │
│  is often disputed, with some scholars claiming that the actual date was    │
│  [[314]], when [[Gregory the Illuminator]] converted [[Tiridates III of     │
│  Armenia|King Tiridates III]] and members of his court to Christianity.     │
│  This conversion led to the creation of the [[Armenian alphabet]] by        │
│  [[Mesrop Mashtots]] in [[405]].                                            │

│  After the fall of the Armenian kingdom in [[428]], Armenia was under       │
│  [[Sassanid]] and then [[Byzantine]] rule. In [[645]], the [[Arab           │
│  Caliphate]] conquered Armenia. Armenia became an autonomous principality   │
│  of the Arab Empire, with the [[Bagratuni]] family coming to power. The     │
│  Bagratuni Dynasty established the second Armenian Kingdom in [[885]]. The  │
│  kingdom was at its height under [[Ashot III]] (953-977) and [[Gagik I]]    │
│  (990-1020).                                                                │

│  In [[1045]], the Byzantine Empire conquered the Bagratuni Armenian         │
│  Kingdom. Soon, the [[Seljuk Turks]] defeated the Byzantines and conquered  │
│  Armenia. In [[1080]], the [[Rubenid Dynasty]] established the [[Armenian   │
│  Kingdom of Cilicia]] in [[Cilicia]], which was a powerful state in the     │
│  [[Crusades]]. The kingdom was allied with the [[Crusaders]], and was       │

│  million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The     │
│  coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided   │

│  [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]]     │
│  west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western       │
│  Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they        │
│  correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the  │
│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │

│  Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The   │
│  [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements,              │
│  collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international  │
│  relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited           │
│  continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined    │
│  as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th       │
│  [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries,    │
│  including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside    │
│  Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific     │
│  investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on   │
│  that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established  │
│  during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a  │
│  military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military       │
│  bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the   │
│  testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel    │
│  or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful             │
│  purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.            │

│  Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]]   │
│  in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1998 [[NASA]] satellite data    │
│  showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record,        │
│  covering 27&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas  │
│  of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.&lt;ref       │

│  [[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study  │
│  of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to  │
│  come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger            │
│  [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In     │
│  1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these  │
│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │
│  years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at      │
│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │
│  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth,     │
│  the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref             │

│  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the   │
│  abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites        │
│  relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare           │
│  meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off  │
│  the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically     │
│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │
│  Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time   │
│  elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from           │
│  laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence  │
│  age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in    │
│  environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref                      │

│  The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic     │
│  Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the          │
│  southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14                │
│  million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The     │
│  coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided   │
│  in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the   │
│  [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]]     │
│  west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western       │
│  Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they        │
│  correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the  │
│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │
│  located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]   │
│  has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its        │
│  collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would   │
│  rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its     │

│  and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread        │

│  Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The   │
│  [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements,              │
│  collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international  │
│  relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited           │
│  continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined    │
│  as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th       │
│  [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries,    │
│  including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside    │
│  Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific     │
│  investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on   │
│  that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established  │
│  during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a  │
│  military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military       │
│  bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the   │
│  testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel    │
│  or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful             │
│  purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.            │

│  [[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study  │
│  of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to  │
│  come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger            │
│  [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In     │
│  1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these  │
│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │
│  years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at      │
│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │
│  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth,     │
│  the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref             │

│  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the   │
│  abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites        │
│  relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare           │
│  meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off  │
│  the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically     │
│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │
│  Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time   │
│  elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from           │
│  laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence  │
│  age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in    │
│  environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref                      │

│  The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic     │
│  Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the          │
│  southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14                │
│  million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The     │
│  coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided   │
│  in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the   │
│  [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]]     │
│  west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western       │
│  Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they        │
│  correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the  │
│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │
│  located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]   │
│  has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its        │
│  collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would   │
│  rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its     │
│  zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the    │
│  world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref                            │

│  opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]]  │
│  and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread        │
│  quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since     │

│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │
│  years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at      │
│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │
│  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth,     │
│  the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref             │

│  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the   │
│  abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites        │
│  relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare           │
│  meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off  │
│  the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically     │
│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │
│  Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time   │
│  elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from           │
│  laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence  │
│  age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in    │
│  environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref                      │

│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │

│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │

│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │

│  The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic     │
│  Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the          │
│  southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14                │
│  million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The     │
│  coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided   │
│  in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the   │
│  [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]]     │
│  west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western       │
│  Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they        │
│  correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the  │
│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │
│  located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]   │
│  has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its        │
│  collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would   │
│  rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its     │
│  zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the    │
│  world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref                            │

│  and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread        │

│  [[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study  │
│  of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to  │
│  come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger            │
│  [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In     │
│  1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these  │
│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │
│  years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at      │
│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │
│  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth,     │
│  the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref             │

│  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the   │
│  abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites        │
│  relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare           │
│  meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off  │
│  the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically     │
│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │

│  elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from           │

│  Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the          │
│  southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14                │
│  million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The     │
│  coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided   │
│  in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the   │
│  [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]]     │
│  west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western       │
│  Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they        │
│  correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the  │
│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │
│  located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]   │
│  has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its        │
│  collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would   │
│  rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its     │
│  zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the    │
│  world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref                            │

│  Armenia is a very ancient country, with a rich history. It is located in   │
│  the highlands surrounding the biblical [[Mount Ararat]], where, according  │
│  to the Bible, [[Noah's Ark]] landed after the great flood.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Archaeological studies in the last 30 years have shown that Armenia was    │
│  one of the earliest sites of human civilization. The earliest evidence of  │
│  human settlement in Armenia is from the [[Stone Age]]. The                 │
│  [[Shulaveri-Shomu culture]] of the central Transcaucasus region is one of  │
│  the earliest prehistoric cultures in the area, dating to roughly 6000 -    │
│  4000 BC.                                                                   │

│  During the [[Bronze Age]], several states flourished in the area of        │
│  Greater Armenia, including the [[Hittite Empire]] (at the height of its    │
│  power), [[Mitanni]] (South-Western historical Armenia), and                │
│  [[Hayasa-Azzi]] (1600-1200 BC). The [[Nairi]] confederation (1200-900 BC)  │
│  and the [[Kingdom of Urartu]] (1000-600 BC) successively established       │
│  their sovereignty over the Armenian Highlands. Each of the aforementioned  │
│  nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian        │
│  people.                                                                    │

│  The name Armenia was given to the country by the surrounding states, as    │
│  it was the name of the strongest tribe living in the historic Armenian     │
│  lands, who called themselves ''Armens''. It is traditionally derived from  │
│  ''Armenak'' or ''Aram'' (the great-grandson of Haik's great-grandson, and  │
│  another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of    │
│  all Armenians). Some Jewish and Christian scholars write that the name     │
│  'Armenia' was derived from ''Har-Minni'', meaning &quot;Mountains of       │
│  Minni&quot; (from the [[Bible]], [[Jeremiah]] 51:27).                      │
│                                                                             │
│  === Early Armenian Kingdoms ===                                            │
│  The [[Kingdom of Urartu]] was replaced by the [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontid    │
│  Dynasty]] (600-200 BC), which established the first Armenian Kingdom. The  │
│  kingdom was at its height between 95 BC and 65 BC under [[Tigranes the     │
│  Great]], becoming one of the most powerful kingdoms of its time.           │
│  Throughout its history, the Armenian kingdom was either independent or     │
│  autonomous under the rule of the [[Persian Empire]], [[Macedonian          │

│  million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The     │
│  coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided   │
│  in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the   │
│  [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]]     │
│  west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western       │
│  Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they        │
│  correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the  │
│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │
│  located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]   │

│  collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would   │
│  rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its     │

│  [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries,    │

│  investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on   │

│  come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger            │
│  [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In     │
│  1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these  │
│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │
│  years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at      │
│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │
│  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth,     │
│  the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref             │

│  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the   │
│  abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites        │
│  relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare           │
│  meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off  │
│  the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically     │
│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │

│  elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from           │

│  coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided   │
│  in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the   │
│  [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]]     │
│  west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western       │
│  Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they        │
│  correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the  │
│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │
│  located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]   │

│  collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international  │
│  relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited           │
│  continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined    │
│  as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th       │
│  [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries,    │
│  including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside    │
│  Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific     │
│  investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on   │
│  that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established  │
│  during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a  │
│  military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military       │
│  bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the   │

│  [[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study  │

│  come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger            │
│  [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In     │
│  1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these  │
│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │
│  years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at      │
│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │
│  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth,     │
│  the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref             │

│  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the   │
│  abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites        │
│  relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare           │
│  meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off  │
│  the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically     │
│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │
│  Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time   │
│  elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from           │

│  collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international  │

│  continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined    │
│  as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th       │
│  [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries,    │
│  including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside    │
│  Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific     │
│  investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on   │
│  that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established  │
│  during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a  │
│  military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military       │
│  bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the   │
│  testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel    │

│  come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger            │
│  [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In     │
│  1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these  │
│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │
│  years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at      │
│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │
│  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth,     │
│  the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref             │

│  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the   │
│  abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites        │
│  relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare           │
│  meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off  │
│  the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically     │
│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │
│  Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time   │
│  elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from           │
│  laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence  │

│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │

│  Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The   │
│  [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements,              │
│  collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international  │
│  relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited           │
│  continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined    │
│  as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th       │
│  [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries,    │
│  including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside    │
│  Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific     │
│  investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on   │
│  that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established  │
│  during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a  │
│  military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military       │
│  bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the   │
│  testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel    │

│  come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger            │
│  [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In     │
│  1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these  │
│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │
│  years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at      │
│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │
│  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth,     │
│  the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref             │

│  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the   │
│  abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites        │
│  relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare           │
│  meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off  │
│  the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically     │
│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │
│  Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time   │
│  elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from           │

│  [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]]     │
│  west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western       │
│  Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they        │
│  correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the  │
│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │

│  collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international  │

│  continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined    │
│  as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th       │
│  [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries,    │
│  including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside    │
│  Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific     │
│  investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on   │
│  that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established  │
│  during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a  │
│  military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military       │
│  bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the   │
│  testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel    │

│  [[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study  │
│  of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to  │
│  come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger            │
│  [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In     │
│  1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these  │
│  meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million      │
│  years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at      │
│  blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing     │
│  them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.          │
│  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth,     │
│  the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref             │

│  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the   │
│  abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites        │
│  relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare           │
│  meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off  │
│  the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically     │
│  [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the            │
│  controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars.       │
│  Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time   │
│  elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from           │

│  verified landing in 1821 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail        │
│  Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent had    │
│  been largely neglected in the 19th century because of its hostile          │
│  environment, lack of efficient resources, and its isolated location.       │

│  seven countries ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[France]],      │
│  [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) maintain           │
│  territorial claims. Most other countries do not recognise these claims,    │
│  and the claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom all overlap.     │
│  Its usage is regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959 by 12   │
│  countries, which prohibits any military activity, supports scientific      │
│  research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]].  Ongoing experiments   │

│  [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West        │
│  Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an     │
│  [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson          │
│  Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is      │

│  The climate of Antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist. A   │
│  combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture   │
│  and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant     │
│  life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic          │
│  community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the          │
│  continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and  │
│  [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few        │
│  weeks, at most.                                                            │

│  There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species    │
│  of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most  │
│  of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and            │
│  [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the      │
│  summer.  There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic  │
│  Peninsula: [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic                        │

│  A variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly,  │
│  on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue     │
│  whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]]    │
│  is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The       │
│  [[Adélie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The              │
│  [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one       │
│  could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also            │
│  predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily  │
│  hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the     │
│  United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate    │

│  Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The   │
│  [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements,              │
│  collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international  │
│  relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited           │
│  continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined    │
│  as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th       │
│  [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries,    │
│  including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside    │
│  Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific     │
│  investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on   │
│  that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established  │
│  during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a  │
│  military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military       │
│  bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the   │
│  testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel    │
│  or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful             │

AGENT_RESULT_JSON:{"final_text": " meaning &quot;Mountains of Minni&quot; (from the [[Bible]], [[Jeremiah]] 51:27).\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Armenia}}\n\n[[Image:Armenia-Urartu.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Urartu]] (Ararat) in the 9th century BC]]\nArmenia is a very ancient country, with a rich history. It is located in the highlands surrounding the biblical [[Mount Ararat]], where, according to the Bible, [[Noah's Ark]] landed after the great flood.\n\nArchaeological studies in the last 30 years have shown that Armenia was one of the earliest sites of human civilization. The earliest evidence of human settlement in Armenia is from the [[Stone Age]]. The [[Shulaveri-Shomu culture]] of the central Transcaucasus region is one of the earliest prehistoric cultures in the area, dating to roughly 6000 - 4000 BC.\n\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]], several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the [[Hittite Empire]] (at the height of its power), [[Mitanni]] (South-Western historical Armenia), and [[Hayasa-Azzi]] (1600-1200 BC). The [[Nairi]] confederation (1200-900 BC) and the [[Kingdom of Urartu]] (1000-600 BC) successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highlands. Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people.\n\nThe name Armenia was given to the country by the surrounding states, as it was the name of the strongest tribe living in the historic Armenian lands, who called themselves ''Armens''. It is traditionally derived from ''Armenak'' or ''Aram'' (the great-grandson of Haik's great-grandson, and another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of all Armenians). Some Jewish and Christian scholars write that the name 'Armenia' was derived from ''Har-Minni'', meaning &quot;Mountains of Minni&quot; (from the [[Bible]], [[Jeremiah]] 51:27).\n\n=== Early Armenian Kingdoms ===\nThe [[Kingdom of Urartu]] was replaced by the [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontid Dynasty]] (600-200 BC), which established the first Armenian Kingdom. The kingdom was at its height between 95 BC and 65 BC under [[Tigranes the Great]], becoming one of the most powerful kingdoms of its time. Throughout its history, the Armenian kingdom was either independent or autonomous under the rule of the [[Persian Empire]], [[Macedonian Empire]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Arab Caliphate]], [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Russian Empire]].\n\nArmenia was the first nation to adopt [[Christianity]] as its state religion, in the early 4th century (traditionally in [[301]]). This date is often disputed, with some scholars claiming that the actual date was [[314]], when [[Gregory the Illuminator]] converted [[Tiridates III of Armenia|King Tiridates III]] and members of his court to Christianity. This conversion led to the creation of the [[Armenian alphabet]] by [[Mesrop Mashtots]] in [[405]].\n\n=== Medieval Armenia ===\n[[Image:Ani Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ani Cathedral]] in the medieval Armenian capital of [[Ani]].]]\nAfter the fall of the Armenian kingdom in [[428]], Armenia was under [[Sassanid]] and then [[Byzantine]] rule. In [[645]], the [[Arab Caliphate]] conquered Armenia. Armenia became an autonomous principality of the Arab Empire, with the [[Bagratuni]] family coming to power. The Bagratuni Dynasty established the second Armenian Kingdom in [[885]]. The kingdom was at its height under [[Ashot III]] (953-977) and [[Gagik I]] (990-1020).\n\nIn [[1045]], the Byzantine Empire conquered the Bagratuni Armenian Kingdom. Soon, the [[Seljuk Turks]] defeated the Byzantines and conquered Armenia. In [[1080]], the [[Rubenid Dynasty]] established the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] in [[Cilicia]], which was a powerful state in the [[Crusades]]. The kingdom was allied with the [[Crusaders]], and was later conquered by the [[Mamluks]] in [[1375]].\n\n=== Foreign Domination ===\nIn the 16th century, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] empires divided Armenia. In the 19th century, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] conquered Eastern Armenia (present-day Armenia) from Persia.\n\n=== Armenian Genocide ===\n{{main|Armenian Genocide}}\n\n[[Image:Armenian Genocide.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]] in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]].]]\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] carried out the [[Armenian Genocide]], in which 1.5 million Armenians were killed. The Armenian Genocide is considered to be the first modern genocide. The Turkish government denies that the Armenian Genocide took place.\n\n=== Soviet Armenia ===\nAfter the collapse of the Russian Empire in [[1917]], Armenia declared its independence in [[1918]], establishing the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. In [[1920]], the [[Red Army]] invaded Armenia and established the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In [[1922]], Armenia became part of the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], which was a part of the [[Soviet Union]]. In [[1936]], the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was dissolved, and Armenia became a separate Soviet republic.\n\n=== Independent Armenia ===\nIn [[1991]], Armenia declared its independence from the Soviet Union. Since then, Armenia has been involved in a conflict with Azerbaijan over the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region.\n\n== Politics ==\n{{main|Politics of Armenia}}\n\nArmenia is a [[democratic republic]]. The [[President of Armenia|President]] is the head of state, and the [[Prime Minister of Armenia|Prime Minister]] is the head of government. The president is elected for a five-year term. The unicameral [[National Assembly of Armenia|National Assembly]] (''Azgayin Zhoghov'') is the legislative body. Its 131 members are elected for a four-year term.\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n{{main|Administrative divisions of Armenia}}\n\nArmenia is divided into 10 ''marzer'' (provinces, singular ''marz''), plus the capital city of [[Yerevan]].\nThe provinces are:\n* [[Aragatsotn Province|Aragatsotn]]\n* [[Ararat Province|Ararat]]\n* [[Armavir Province|Armavir]]\n* [[Gegharkunik Province|Gegharkunik]]\n* [[Kotayk Province|Kotayk]]\n* [[Lorri Province|Lorri]]\n* [[Shirak Province|Shirak]]\n* [[Syunik Province|Syunik]]\n* [[Tavush Province|Tavush]]\n* [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzor]]\n* [[Yerevan]] (capital city)\n\n== Geography ==\n{{main|Geography of Armenia}}\n\n[[Image:Ararat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mount Ararat]], the national symbol of Armenia, is located in [[Turkey]].]]\nArmenia is a landlocked country in the South Caucasus region, between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. It is bordered by [[Turkey]] to the west, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the north, [[Azerbaijan]] to the east, and [[Iran]] and the [[Nakhichevan]] [[exclave]] of Azerbaijan to the south.\n\nThe terrain is mostly mountainous, with fast-flowing rivers and few forests. The climate is continental, with hot summers and cold winters. The highest point is [[Mount Aragats]], at 4,090 meters (13,419 ft).\n\n== Economy ==\n{{main|Economy of Armenia}}\n\nThe Armenian economy is largely based on [[industry]], especially [[mining]] and [[manufacturing]]. The country is rich in [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[zinc]], and [[gold]]. Agriculture is also an important sector, with [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s, and [[wine]] being the main products.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia transitioned to a market economy. The country has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, with GDP growth rates of over 10% annually. However, poverty remains a challenge, and unemployment is high.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{main|Demographics of Armenia}}\n\nThe population of Armenia is predominantly ethnic Armenian (97.9%). The largest minorities are [[Yazidis]] (1.3%) and [[Russian people|Russians]] (0.5%). The official language is [[Armenian language|Armenian]].\n\nArmenia is the first nation to adopt [[Christianity]] as its state religion, in the early 4th century. The vast majority of the population (94.7%) belongs to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].\n\n== Culture ==\n{{main|Culture of Armenia}}\n\n[[Image:Armenian alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Armenian alphabet]] was created in [[405]].]]\nArmenian culture is rich and diverse, with a long history. It is influenced by both Eastern and Western cultures. The [[Armenian alphabet]] was created in [[405]] by [[Mesrop Mashtots]].\n\n*[[Armenian architecture]]\n*[[Armenian cuisine]]\n*[[Armenian dance]]\n*[[Armenian music]]\n*[[Armenian

Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick.

Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months.

[[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate.

The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.

The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;

Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[Image:Mt erebus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mt.

[[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}\n{{sect-stub}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Antarctica}}\n\n[[Image:Lake Fryxell.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|Blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]\nAntarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;\n\nDepending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation.

A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. \n\nThere are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.

Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. \n\nA variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Ad\u00e9lie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem.

The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.

[[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment.

The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies.

Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse.

Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months.

[[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate.

The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.

The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;

Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[Image:Mt erebus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mt.

[[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}\n{{sect-stub}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Antarctica}}\n\n[[Image:Lake Fryxell.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|Blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]\nAntarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;\n\nDepending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation.

A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. \n\nThere are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.

Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. \n\nA variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Ad\u00e9lie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem.

The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.

[[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment.

The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies.

Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse.

The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.

== History ==
{{main|History of Armenia}}

[[Image:Armenia-Urartu.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Urartu]] (Ararat) in the 9th century BC]]
Armenia is a very ancient country, with a rich history. It is located in the highlands surrounding the biblical [[Mount Ararat]], where, according to the Bible, [[Noah's Ark]] landed after the great flood.

Archaeological studies in the last 30 years have shown that Armenia was one of the earliest sites of human civilization. The earliest evidence of human settlement in Armenia is from the [[Stone Age]]. The [[Shulaveri-Shomu culture]] of the central Transcaucasus region is one of the earliest prehistoric cultures in the area, dating to roughly 6000 - 4000 BC.

During the [[Bronze Age]], several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the [[Hittite Empire]] (at the height of its power), [[Mitanni]] (South-Western historical Armenia), and [[Hayasa-Azzi]] (1600-1200 BC). The [[Nairi]] confederation (1200-900 BC) and the [[Kingdom of Urartu]] (1000-600 BC) successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highlands. Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people.

The name Armenia was given to the country by the surrounding states, as it was the name of the strongest tribe living in the historic Armenian lands, who called themselves ''Armens''. It is traditionally derived from ''Armenak'' or ''Aram'' (the great-grandson of Haik's great-grandson, and another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of all Armenians). Some Jewish and Christian scholars write that the name 'Armenia' was derived from ''Har-Minni'', meaning &quot;Mountains of Minni&quot; (from the [[Bible]], [[Jeremiah]] 51:27).

=== Early Armenian Kingdoms ===
The [[Kingdom of Urartu]] was replaced by the [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontid Dynasty]] (600-200 BC), which established the first Armenian Kingdom. The kingdom was at its height between 95 BC and 65 BC under [[Tigranes the Great]], becoming one of the most powerful kingdoms of its time. Throughout its history, the Armenian kingdom was either independent or autonomous under the rule of the [[Persian Empire]], [[Macedonian Empire]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Arab Caliphate]], [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Russian Empire]].

Armenia was the first nation to adopt [[Christianity]] as its state religion, in the early 4th century (traditionally in [[301]]). This date is often disputed, with some scholars claiming that the actual date was [[314]], when [[Gregory the Illuminator]] converted [[Tiridates III of Armenia|King Tiridates III]] and members of his court to Christianity. This conversion led to the creation of the [[Armenian alphabet]] by [[Mesrop Mashtots]] in [[405]].

=== Medieval Armenia ===
[[Image:Ani Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ani Cathedral]] in the medieval Armenian capital of [[Ani]].]]
After the fall of the Armenian kingdom in [[428]], Armenia was under [[Sassanid]] and then [[Byzantine]] rule. In [[645]], the [[Arab Caliphate]] conquered Armenia. Armenia became an autonomous principality of the Arab Empire, with the [[Bagratuni]] family coming to power. The Bagratuni Dynasty established the second Armenian Kingdom in [[885]]. The kingdom was at its height under [[Ashot III]] (953-977) and [[Gagik I]] (990-1020).

In [[1045]], the Byzantine Empire conquered the Bagratuni Armenian Kingdom. Soon, the [[Seljuk Turks]] defeated the Byzantines and conquered Armenia. In [[1080]], the [[Rubenid Dynasty]] established the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] in [[Cilicia]], which was a powerful state in the [[Crusades]]. The kingdom was allied with the [[Crusaders]], and was later conquered by the [[Mamluks]] in [[1375]].

=== Foreign Domination ===
In the 16th century, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] empires divided Armenia. In the 19th century, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] conquered Eastern Armenia (present-day Armenia) from Persia.

=== Armenian Genocide ===
{{main|Armenian Genocide}}

[[Image:Armenian Genocide.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]] in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]].]]
During [[World War I]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] carried out the [[Armenian Genocide]], in which 1.5 million Armenians were killed. The Armenian Genocide is considered to be the first modern genocide. The Turkish government denies that the Armenian Genocide took place.

=== Soviet Armenia ===
After the collapse of the Russian Empire in [[1917]], Armenia declared its independence in [[1918]], establishing the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. In [[1920]], the [[Red Army]] invaded Armenia and established the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In [[1922]], Armenia became part of the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], which was a part of the [[Soviet Union]]. In [[1936]], the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was dissolved, and Armenia became a separate Soviet republic.

=== Independent Armenia ===
In [[1991]], Armenia declared its independence from the Soviet Union. Since then, Armenia has been involved in a conflict with Azerbaijan over the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region.

== Politics ==

'''Antarctica''' ([[Greek language|Greek]], ''antarktikos'': &quot;opposite the [[Arctic]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon '' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=%239514 &quot;antarktikos&quot;]. Retrieved February 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[continent]] encircling the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[South Pole]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]] and divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. It is a [[desert|cold desert]] and, on average, the coldest place on Earth.  98% of the continent is covered by [[ice]]. Its 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; make it the fifth largest continent and the world's largest [[desert]]. There are no permanent human residents, and only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguins]], [[fur seals]], [[lichen]]s, and hundreds of types of [[algae]]. 

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) go back to antiquity, the first commonly accepted sighting of the continent occurred in 1820 and the first verified landing in 1821 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent had been largely neglected in the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of efficient resources, and its isolated location.

Antarctica is not under the political sovereignty of any nation, although seven countries ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) maintain territorial claims. Most other countries do not recognise these claims, and the claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom all overlap. Its usage is regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959 by 12 countries, which prohibits any military activity, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]].  Ongoing experiments are conducted yearly by more than 4,000 scientists of diverse backgrounds and interests.

[[Image:Shackleton expedition.jpg|left|thumb|210px|''The Endurance'' at night during [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1914.]]
In the Western world, beliefs in a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent located in the far south of the globe to &quot;balance&quot; out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa—had existed for centuries. Even by late in the 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of &quot;Antarctica&quot;, geographers believed the continent was much larger than its true size. European maps continued to show this land until [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] and the crews of his expedition's ships, ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on [[January 17]], [[1773]] and again in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;The Mariners' Museum [http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php ''Age of Exploration - James Cook'']. Retrieved February 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various organizations (the [[National Science Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Antarctica}}

[[Image:Antarctica satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|150px|A satellite composite image of Antarctica]]
The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Deception Island]] and [[Mt. Erebus]] are active. Mount Erebus, located in [[Ross Island]], is the southernmost active volcano on Earth. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;British Antarctic Survey.

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet, including one under the South Pole itself. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath [[Russia]]'s [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. Due to the lake's similarity to [[Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]], confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on Europa.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/fslakevostok.htm Lake Vostok] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
===Gondwana breakup===
More than 170 million years ago (Mya), Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. [[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}

[[Image:Lake Fryxell.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|Blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]
Antarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sundog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright &quot;spot&quot; beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Antarctic researchers.jpg|thumb|Two American researchers studying [[plankton]] through [[microscope]]s.]]
Although Antarctica has no permanent residents, a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter. Many of the stations are staffed around the year.

[[Emilio Marcos Palma]] was the first person born in Antarctica (Base Esperanza) in 1978, his parents being sent there along with seven other families by the Argentinean government to determine if family life was suitable in the continent. In 1986 Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antarctic Sun'' [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html Questions and answers] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
{{main|Antarctic flora}}
[[Image:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|left|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist. A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. 

There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.  There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic pearlwort]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Antarctic Division [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551 Antarctic Wildlife] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

Land [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] is completely [[invertebrate]]. Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. 

A variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Adélie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem. Particularly, the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

==Politics==
Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. [http://www.scar.org/treaty/ ''Antarctic Treaty''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no government. Various countries claim areas of it, but most countries do not recognize those claims. The area between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west is the only land on Earth not claimed by any country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they exist in quantities too small to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] prevents such struggle for resources. In 1998 a compromise agreement was reached to add a 50-year ban on mining until the year 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary agricultural activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish.

Each year, scientists from 27 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world but the Antarctic. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to nearly 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The [[McMurdo Station]] is capable of housing more than a thousand scientists, visitors, and tourists. 

Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. [[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Antarctic Connection [http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml Science in Antarctica] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1998 [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]].]]

[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot; /&gt;

It is a [[desert|cold desert]] and, on average, the coldest place on Earth.  98% of the continent is covered by [[ice]]. Its 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; make it the fifth largest continent and the world's largest [[desert]]. There are no permanent human residents, and only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguins]], [[fur seals]], [[lichen]]s, and hundreds of types of [[algae]]. 

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) go back to antiquity, the first commonly accepted sighting of the continent occurred in 1820 and the first verified landing in 1821 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent had been largely neglected in the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of efficient resources, and its isolated location.

Antarctica is not under the political sovereignty of any nation, although seven countries ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) maintain territorial claims. Most other countries do not recognise these claims, and the claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom all overlap. Its usage is regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959 by 12 countries, which prohibits any military activity, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]].  Ongoing experiments are conducted yearly by more than 4,000 scientists of diverse backgrounds and interests.

In the Western world, beliefs in a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent located in the far south of the globe to &quot;balance&quot; out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa—had existed for centuries. Even by late in the 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of &quot;Antarctica&quot;, geographers believed the continent was much larger than its true size. European maps continued to show this land until [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] and the crews of his expedition's ships, ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on [[January 17]], [[1773]] and again in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;The Mariners' Museum [http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php ''Age of Exploration - James Cook''].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Antarctica}}

[[Image:Antarctica satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|150px|A satellite composite image of Antarctica]]
The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Mt erebus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mt. Erebus]], an active volcano in [[Ross Island]].]]
Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Deception Island]] and [[Mt. Erebus]] are active. Mount Erebus, located in [[Ross Island]], is the southernmost active volcano on Earth. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;British Antarctic Survey.

Retrieved February 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, an underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers. Recent evidence shows this unnamed volcano may be active.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation.

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet, including one under the South Pole itself. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath [[Russia]]'s [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. Due to the lake's similarity to [[Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]], confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on Europa.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/fslakevostok.htm Lake Vostok] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
===Gondwana breakup===
More than 170 million years ago (Mya), Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. [[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}

Antarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sundog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright &quot;spot&quot; beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot; /&gt;

Although Antarctica has no permanent residents, a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter. Many of the stations are staffed around the year.

[[Emilio Marcos Palma]] was the first person born in Antarctica (Base Esperanza) in 1978, his parents being sent there along with seven other families by the Argentinean government to determine if family life was suitable in the continent. In 1986 Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antarctic Sun'' [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html Questions and answers] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
{{main|Antarctic flora}}
[[Image:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|left|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist. A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. 

There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.  There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic pearlwort]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Antarctic Division [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551 Antarctic Wildlife] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

Land [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] is completely [[invertebrate]]. Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. 

A variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Adélie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem. Particularly, the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

==Politics==
Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. [http://www.scar.org/treaty/ ''Antarctic Treaty''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no government. Various countries claim areas of it, but most countries do not recognize those claims. The area between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west is the only land on Earth not claimed by any country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they exist in quantities too small to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] prevents such struggle for resources. In 1998 a compromise agreement was reached to add a 50-year ban on mining until the year 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary agricultural activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish.

Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. [[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment.

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1998 [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot; /&gt;

It is a [[desert|cold desert]] and, on average, the coldest place on Earth.  98% of the continent is covered by [[ice]]. Its 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; make it the fifth largest continent and the world's largest [[desert]]. There are no permanent human residents, and only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguins]], [[fur seals]], [[lichen]]s, and hundreds of types of [[algae]]. 

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) go back to antiquity, the first commonly accepted sighting of the continent occurred in 1820 and the first verified landing in 1821 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent had been largely neglected in the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of efficient resources, and its isolated location.

Antarctica is not under the political sovereignty of any nation, although seven countries ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) maintain territorial claims. Most other countries do not recognise these claims, and the claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom all overlap. Its usage is regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959 by 12 countries, which prohibits any military activity, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]].  Ongoing experiments are conducted yearly by more than 4,000 scientists of diverse backgrounds and interests.

In the Western world, beliefs in a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent located in the far south of the globe to &quot;balance&quot; out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa—had existed for centuries. Even by late in the 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of &quot;Antarctica&quot;, geographers believed the continent was much larger than its true size. European maps continued to show this land until [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] and the crews of his expedition's ships, ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on [[January 17]], [[1773]] and again in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;The Mariners' Museum [http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php ''Age of Exploration - James Cook''].

Bransfield supposedly saw Antarctica on [[January 27]], [[1820]], three days before Palmer sighted land. It is certain that on [[January 28]], [[1820]] the expedition led by [[Fabian von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev]] on two ships reached a point within 32&amp;nbsp;km (20&amp;nbsp;miles) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there.

In 1841 explorer [[James Clark Ross]] sailed through what is now known as the [[Ross Sea]] and discovered [[Ross Island]]. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Antarctica}}

[[Image:Antarctica satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|150px|A satellite composite image of Antarctica]]
The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Mt erebus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mt. Erebus]], an active volcano in [[Ross Island]].]]
Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Deception Island]] and [[Mt. Erebus]] are active. Mount Erebus, located in [[Ross Island]], is the southernmost active volcano on Earth. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/About_Antarctica/Rock/Volcanoes.html Volcanoes]. Retrieved February 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, an underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers. Recent evidence shows this unnamed volcano may be active.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation. [http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100385 Scientists Discover Undersea Volcano Off Antarctica]. Retrieved February 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet, including one under the South Pole itself. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath [[Russia]]'s [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. Due to the lake's similarity to [[Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]], confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on Europa.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/fslakevostok.htm Lake Vostok] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
===Gondwana breakup===
More than 170 million years ago (Mya), Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. [[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}

[[Image:Lake Fryxell.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|Blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]
Antarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sundog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright &quot;spot&quot; beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot; /&gt;

Although Antarctica has no permanent residents, a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter. Many of the stations are staffed around the year.

[[Emilio Marcos Palma]] was the first person born in Antarctica (Base Esperanza) in 1978, his parents being sent there along with seven other families by the Argentinean government to determine if family life was suitable in the continent. In 1986 Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antarctic Sun'' [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html Questions and answers] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
{{main|Antarctic flora}}
[[Image:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|left|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist. A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. 

There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.  There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic pearlwort]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Antarctic Division [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551 Antarctic Wildlife] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

Land [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] is completely [[invertebrate]]. Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. 

A variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Adélie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem. Particularly, the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

==Politics==
Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. [http://www.scar.org/treaty/ ''Antarctic Treaty''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no government. Various countries claim areas of it, but most countries do not recognize those claims. The area between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west is the only land on Earth not claimed by any country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

The only documented large-scale land military maneuver was &quot;[[Operación 90]]&quot;, undertaken 10 years before the Antarctic Treaty by the [[Military of Argentina|Argentinian military]].&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica Institute of Argentina.

The Argentinean, British and Chilean claims all overlap. 

[[Germany]] also maintained a claim to Antarctica, known as [[New Swabia]] between 1939 and 1945. It was situated at 20°E and 10°W, overlapping Norway's claim.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Antarctica}}
[[Image:Antarctic cod.jpg|thumb|The illegal capture and sale of the [[Patagonian toothfish]] has led to several arrests.]]

Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they exist in quantities too small to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] prevents such struggle for resources. In 1998 a compromise agreement was reached to add a 50-year ban on mining until the year 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary agricultural activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000-01 reported landing 112,934 metric tons.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santa Barbara City College Biological Sciences [http://www.biosbcc.net/ocean/AAimportance.htm Importance of Antarctica] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale tourism has existed since 1957. As of 2006 several ships transport people into Antarctica for specific scenic locations. A total of 13,571 tourists visited in the 2002-03 antarctic summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships. The average stay is about two weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm Politics of Antarctica] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Antarctic flights brought tourists from Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 near [[Mount Erebus]].

==Research==
{{seealso|List of research stations in Antarctica}}

[[Image:Amundsen-Scott marsstation ray h edit.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A [[full moon]] and 25-second exposure allowed sufficient light into this photo taken at [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] during the long Antarctic night. The new station can be seen at far left, [[power plant]] in the center and the old mechanic's garage in the lower right.]]
Each year, scientists from 27 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world but the Antarctic. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to nearly 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The [[McMurdo Station]] is capable of housing more than a thousand scientists, visitors, and tourists. 

Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. [[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Antarctic Connection [http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml Science in Antarctica] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1998 [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]].]]

[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot; /&gt;

It is a [[desert|cold desert]] and, on average, the coldest place on Earth.  98% of the continent is covered by [[ice]]. Its 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; make it the fifth largest continent and the world's largest [[desert]]. There are no permanent human residents, and only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguins]], [[fur seals]], [[lichen]]s, and hundreds of types of [[algae]]. 

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) go back to antiquity, the first commonly accepted sighting of the continent occurred in 1820 and the first verified landing in 1821 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent had been largely neglected in the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of efficient resources, and its isolated location.

Antarctica is not under the political sovereignty of any nation, although seven countries ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) maintain territorial claims. Most other countries do not recognise these claims, and the claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom all overlap. Its usage is regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959 by 12 countries, which prohibits any military activity, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]].  Ongoing experiments are conducted yearly by more than 4,000 scientists of diverse backgrounds and interests.

In the Western world, beliefs in a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent located in the far south of the globe to &quot;balance&quot; out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa—had existed for centuries. Even by late in the 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of &quot;Antarctica&quot;, geographers believed the continent was much larger than its true size. European maps continued to show this land until [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] and the crews of his expedition's ships, ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on [[January 17]], [[1773]] and again in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;The Mariners' Museum [http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php ''Age of Exploration - James Cook''].

Bransfield supposedly saw Antarctica on [[January 27]], [[1820]], three days before Palmer sighted land. It is certain that on [[January 28]], [[1820]] the expedition led by [[Fabian von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev]] on two ships reached a point within 32&amp;nbsp;km (20&amp;nbsp;miles) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Antarctica}}

[[Image:Antarctica satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|150px|A satellite composite image of Antarctica]]
The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Mt erebus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mt. Erebus]], an active volcano in [[Ross Island]].]]
Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Deception Island]] and [[Mt. Erebus]] are active. Mount Erebus, located in [[Ross Island]], is the southernmost active volcano on Earth. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/About_Antarctica/Rock/Volcanoes.html Volcanoes]. Retrieved February 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, an underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers. Recent evidence shows this unnamed volcano may be active.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation. [http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100385 Scientists Discover Undersea Volcano Off Antarctica]. Retrieved February 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet, including one under the South Pole itself. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath [[Russia]]'s [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. Due to the lake's similarity to [[Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]], confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on Europa.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/fslakevostok.htm Lake Vostok] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
===Gondwana breakup===
More than 170 million years ago (Mya), Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. [[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}

[[Image:Lake Fryxell.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|Blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]
Antarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sundog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright &quot;spot&quot; beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Antarctic researchers.jpg|thumb|Two American researchers studying [[plankton]] through [[microscope]]s.]]
Although Antarctica has no permanent residents, a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter. Many of the stations are staffed around the year.

===Flora===
{{main|Antarctic flora}}
[[Image:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|left|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist. A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. 

There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.  There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic pearlwort]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Antarctic Division [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551 Antarctic Wildlife] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

Land [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] is completely [[invertebrate]]. Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. 

A variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Adélie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem. Particularly, the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

==Politics==
Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. [http://www.scar.org/treaty/ ''Antarctic Treaty''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no government. Various countries claim areas of it, but most countries do not recognize those claims. The area between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west is the only land on Earth not claimed by any country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

The only documented large-scale land military maneuver was &quot;[[Operación 90]]&quot;, undertaken 10 years before the Antarctic Treaty by the [[Military of Argentina|Argentinian military]].&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica Institute of Argentina. [http://www.dna.gov.ar/INGLES/DIVULGAC/ARGANT.HTM ''Argentina in Antarctica''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States military]] issues the [[Antarctica Service Medal]] to military members or civilians who perform research duty on the Antarctica continent. The medal may include a winter-over bar issued to those who remain on the continent for two complete six-month seasons.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Navy [http://www.history.navy.mil/medals/antarc.htm Antarctic Service Medal] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] also maintained a claim to Antarctica, known as [[New Swabia]] between 1939 and 1945. It was situated at 20°E and 10°W, overlapping Norway's claim.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Antarctica}}
[[Image:Antarctic cod.jpg|thumb|The illegal capture and sale of the [[Patagonian toothfish]] has led to several arrests.]]

Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they exist in quantities too small to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] prevents such struggle for resources. In 1998 a compromise agreement was reached to add a 50-year ban on mining until the year 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary agricultural activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000-01 reported landing 112,934 metric tons.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santa Barbara City College Biological Sciences [http://www.biosbcc.net/ocean/AAimportance.htm Importance of Antarctica] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale tourism has existed since 1957. As of 2006 several ships transport people into Antarctica for specific scenic locations. A total of 13,571 tourists visited in the 2002-03 antarctic summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships. The average stay is about two weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm Politics of Antarctica] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Antarctic flights brought tourists from Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 near [[Mount Erebus]].

The new station can be seen at far left, [[power plant]] in the center and the old mechanic's garage in the lower right.]]
Each year, scientists from 27 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world but the Antarctic. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to nearly 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The [[McMurdo Station]] is capable of housing more than a thousand scientists, visitors, and tourists. 

Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. [[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Antarctic Connection [http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml Science in Antarctica] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1998 [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]].]]

[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot; /&gt;

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) go back to antiquity, the first commonly accepted sighting of the continent occurred in 1820 and the first verified landing in 1821 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent had been largely neglected in the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of efficient resources, and its isolated location.

Antarctica is not under the political sovereignty of any nation, although seven countries ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) maintain territorial claims. Most other countries do not recognise these claims, and the claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom all overlap. Its usage is regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959 by 12 countries, which prohibits any military activity, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]].  Ongoing experiments are conducted yearly by more than 4,000 scientists of diverse backgrounds and interests.

In the Western world, beliefs in a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent located in the far south of the globe to &quot;balance&quot; out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa—had existed for centuries. Even by late in the 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of &quot;Antarctica&quot;, geographers believed the continent was much larger than its true size. European maps continued to show this land until [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] and the crews of his expedition's ships, ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on [[January 17]], [[1773]] and again in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;The Mariners' Museum [http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php ''Age of Exploration - James Cook''].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Antarctica}}

[[Image:Antarctica satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|150px|A satellite composite image of Antarctica]]
The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Deception Island]] and [[Mt. Erebus]] are active. Mount Erebus, located in [[Ross Island]], is the southernmost active volcano on Earth. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;British Antarctic Survey.

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet, including one under the South Pole itself. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath [[Russia]]'s [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. Due to the lake's similarity to [[Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]], confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on Europa.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/fslakevostok.htm Lake Vostok] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
===Gondwana breakup===
More than 170 million years ago (Mya), Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. [[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}

[[Image:Lake Fryxell.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|Blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]
Antarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sundog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright &quot;spot&quot; beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot; /&gt;

==Population==
{{seealso|Demographics of Antarctica}}
[[Image:Antarctic researchers.jpg|thumb|Two American researchers studying [[plankton]] through [[microscope]]s.]]
Although Antarctica has no permanent residents, a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter. Many of the stations are staffed around the year.

[[Emilio Marcos Palma]] was the first person born in Antarctica (Base Esperanza) in 1978, his parents being sent there along with seven other families by the Argentinean government to determine if family life was suitable in the continent. In 1986 Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antarctic Sun'' [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html Questions and answers] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
{{main|Antarctic flora}}
[[Image:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|left|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist. A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. 

There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.  There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic pearlwort]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Antarctic Division [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551 Antarctic Wildlife] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

Land [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] is completely [[invertebrate]]. Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. 

A variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Adélie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem. Particularly, the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

==Politics==
Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. [http://www.scar.org/treaty/ ''Antarctic Treaty''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no government. Various countries claim areas of it, but most countries do not recognize those claims. The area between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west is the only land on Earth not claimed by any country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

The only documented large-scale land military maneuver was &quot;[[Operación 90]]&quot;, undertaken 10 years before the Antarctic Treaty by the [[Military of Argentina|Argentinian military]].&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica Institute of Argentina. [http://www.dna.gov.ar/INGLES/DIVULGAC/ARGANT.HTM ''Argentina in Antarctica''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States military]] issues the [[Antarctica Service Medal]] to military members or civilians who perform research duty on the Antarctica continent. The medal may include a winter-over bar issued to those who remain on the continent for two complete six-month seasons.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Navy [http://www.history.navy.mil/medals/antarc.htm Antarctic Service Medal] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Antarctic cod.jpg|thumb|The illegal capture and sale of the [[Patagonian toothfish]] has led to several arrests.]]

Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they exist in quantities too small to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] prevents such struggle for resources. In 1998 a compromise agreement was reached to add a 50-year ban on mining until the year 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary agricultural activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000-01 reported landing 112,934 metric tons.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santa Barbara City College Biological Sciences [http://www.biosbcc.net/ocean/AAimportance.htm Importance of Antarctica] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale tourism has existed since 1957. As of 2006 several ships transport people into Antarctica for specific scenic locations. A total of 13,571 tourists visited in the 2002-03 antarctic summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships. The average stay is about two weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm Politics of Antarctica] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Antarctic flights brought tourists from Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 near [[Mount Erebus]].

Each year, scientists from 27 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world but the Antarctic. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to nearly 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The [[McMurdo Station]] is capable of housing more than a thousand scientists, visitors, and tourists. 

Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. [[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Antarctic Connection [http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml Science in Antarctica] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1998 [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]].]]

[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study of the material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites in Antarctica were found in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last one million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot;&gt;NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, specifically [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorite&quot; /&gt;

It is a [[desert|cold desert]] and, on average, the coldest place on Earth.  98% of the continent is covered by [[ice]]. Its 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; make it the fifth largest continent and the world's largest [[desert]]. There are no permanent human residents, and only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguins]], [[fur seals]], [[lichen]]s, and hundreds of types of [[algae]]. 

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) go back to antiquity, the first commonly accepted sighting of the continent occurred in 1820 and the first verified landing in 1821 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent had been largely neglected in the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of efficient resources, and its isolated location.

Antarctica is not under the political sovereignty of any nation, although seven countries ([[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) maintain territorial claims. Most other countries do not recognise these claims, and the claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom all overlap. Its usage is regulated by the [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959 by 12 countries, which prohibits any military activity, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]].  Ongoing experiments are conducted yearly by more than 4,000 scientists of diverse backgrounds and interests.

In the Western world, beliefs in a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent located in the far south of the globe to &quot;balance&quot; out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa—had existed for centuries. Even by late in the 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of &quot;Antarctica&quot;, geographers believed the continent was much larger than its true size. European maps continued to show this land until [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] and the crews of his expedition's ships, ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on [[January 17]], [[1773]] and again in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;The Mariners' Museum [http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php ''Age of Exploration - James Cook''].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Antarctica}}

[[Image:Antarctica satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|150px|A satellite composite image of Antarctica]]
The continent of Antarctica is located mostly south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on Earth comprising more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; making it the 5th largest continent. The coastline measures 17,968&amp;nbsp;km. Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion of the [[continent]] west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they correspond roughly to the Eastern and Western Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]]. Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. About 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] that is, on average, 2.5 kilometers thick. [[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892&amp;nbsp;meters, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. The [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse. If it does break down, [[Sea level change|ocean level]]s would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time. Despite its zero rainfall in some areas, the continent has approximately 90% of the world's fresh water--in the form of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;Central Intelligence Agency [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Deception Island]] and [[Mt. Erebus]] are active. Mount Erebus, located in [[Ross Island]], is the southernmost active volcano on Earth. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;British Antarctic Survey.

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet, including one under the South Pole itself. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath [[Russia]]'s [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. Due to the lake's similarity to [[Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]], confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on Europa.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/fslakevostok.htm Lake Vostok] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa] Retrieved February 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
===Gondwana breakup===
More than 170 million years ago (Mya), Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. [[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya follwed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then still connected to [[Australia]]) had still tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna, but by about 45 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] had separated from Antarctica and the first ice appeared. At around 25 Mya, due to the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] and the resulting [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], the ice spread quickly, displacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.{{fact}}

Antarctica is the coldest place on earth. Antarctica has little rainfall, with the South Pole getting none, making it a continental desert. Temperatures reach a minimum of between &amp;minus;85 and &amp;minus;90 degrees Celsius (&amp;minus;121 and &amp;minus;130 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter and about 30&amp;nbsp;degrees higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. There is little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the central portion of the continent, but [[ice]] there can last for extended time periods.  However, heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&amp;nbsp;meters (48&amp;nbsp;inches) in 48&amp;nbsp;hours have been recorded. At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are often moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]]. Diamond dust refers to a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sundog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright &quot;spot&quot; beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot; /&gt;

Although Antarctica has no permanent residents, a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter. Many of the stations are staffed around the year.

[[Emilio Marcos Palma]] was the first person born in Antarctica (Base Esperanza) in 1978, his parents being sent there along with seven other families by the Argentinean government to determine if family life was suitable in the continent. In 1986 Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antarctic Sun'' [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html Questions and answers] Retrieved February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
{{main|Antarctic flora}}
[[Image:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|left|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
The climate of Antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist. A combination of freezing temperatures, [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts.  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks, at most. 

There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.  There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic pearlwort]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Antarctic Division [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551 Antarctic Wildlife] Retrieved February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

Land [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] is completely [[invertebrate]]. Such invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than man). The [[snow petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]]. 

A variety of marine animals exist, and they rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. More specifically, the [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica. The [[Adélie Penguin]] breeds further south than any penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes; one could call them elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s are also predominant in the Antarctic. The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. Antarctic krill, which congregate in large [[swarm|school]]s, is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approval of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty enacted in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem. Particularly, the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

==Politics==
Antarctica is considered a neutral territory in respect to politics. The [[Antarctic Treaty]], signed in 1959, and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only uninhabited continent. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of the southern 60th [[circle of latitude|parallel]]. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any measures of a military nature in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, or the testing of any type of weapon. It permits the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.
