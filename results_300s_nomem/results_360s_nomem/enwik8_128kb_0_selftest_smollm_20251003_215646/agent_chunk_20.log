│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │
│  Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a        │
│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │
│  interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see   │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │

│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │

│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understanding the Task (from PCI perspective):** My primary           │
│  objective as Predictive Compression Intelligence is to minimize future     │
│  token prediction entropy. The task requires me to find the exact           │
│  immediate continuation (100-200 words) of a given text prefix. The "Prior  │
│  memory" section of the prompt explicitly provides this continuation. This  │
│  is a direct hit on an external information source (my own                  │
│  memory/context), which is the most efficient way to reduce entropy by      │
│  providing the exact sequence of tokens.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   Identify the provided prefix: "Tucker's conception of              │
│  individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas"                            │
│      *   Locate and extract the exact continuation provided in the "Prior   │
│  memory" section: "of a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on             │
│  [[mutualism|mutual banking]]; Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of        │
│  price|cost as the limit of price]] (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]]    │
│  variety of [[labour theory of value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism;   │
│  [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]]; and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of      │
│  equal freedom&quot;. Tucker strongly supported the individual's right to   │
│  own the product of his or her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;,  │
│  and believed in a <ref name="tucker-pay">[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]],       │
│  Benjamin.                                                                  │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/tucker/tucker37.htm   │
│  Labor and Its Pay]&quot;'' Individual Liberty: Selections From the         │
│  Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker, Vanguard Press, New York, 1926, Kraus      │
│  Reprint Co., Millwood, NY, 1973.</ref>[[market economy]] for trading this  │
│  property. He argued that in a truly free market system without the state,  │
│  the abundance of competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all   │
│  workers received the full value of their labor. Other 19th century         │
│  individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]],   │
│  and [[Victor Yarros]]."                                                    │
│      *   Clean the extracted text by removing wiki-style formatting (e.g.,  │
│  `[[link|text]]` becomes `text`, `&quot;` becomes `"`, `<ref>...</ref>`     │
│  tags are removed).                                                         │
│      *   Verify the word count of the cleaned continuation to ensure it     │
│  falls within the 100-200 word range.                                       │
│      *   Output the cleaned, plain text continuation.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:** The primary challenge is to accurately parse   │
│  and clean the provided text, removing all non-plain-text elements while    │
│  preserving the exact wording. I will carefully go through the text and     │
│  remove the wiki-markup, HTML entities, and reference tags.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   No external tools (like `list_directory`, `read_file_lines`,       │
│  `search_files_content`) are required for this task because the exact       │
│  continuation is already provided within the prompt's "Prior memory"        │
│  section. This is the most direct and entropy-minimizing approach.          │
│      *   I will perform the text cleaning and extraction internally based   │
│  on the provided string.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be the exact, cleaned, plain      │
│  text continuation of the prefix, approximately 112 words long, which       │
│  perfectly aligns with the goal of minimizing future token prediction       │
│  entropy by providing precise, context-rich information.                    │
│                                                                             │
