│  Tool Args: {'plan': '\n1.  **Analyze the Prefix and Task                   │
│  Requirements:**\n    *   The prefix discusses "Autism Spectrum Disorders"  │
│  and their characteristics, including social development and the concept    │
│  of "theory of mind." The text contains Wikipedia-style markup (e.g.,       │
│  `[[...]]`, `&amp;mdash;`, `&quot;`).\n    *   The primary goal is to       │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact,           │
│  immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the given prefix.\n    *   The   │
│  output must be plain text, free of markdown, analysis, commentary,         │
│  formatting, lists, or headings.\n    *   I have access only to the         │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.\n    *   The "prior memory"      │
│  section provides a detailed example of how to clean Wikipedia markup and   │
│  extract specific descriptive blocks while skipping meta-text, headings,    │
│  and lists. This strongly suggests the source is a Wikipedia article and    │
│  guides the extraction and cleaning process.\n\n2.  **Strategic Tool Usage  │
│  and Execution Steps:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Explore the allowed            │
│  directory.**\n        *   **Tool:** `list_directory`\n        *            │
│  **Purpose:** Get an initial overview of the files present in               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This helps in understanding the potential  │
│  source files.\n        *   **Execution:**                                  │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`\n\n    *   **Step  │
│  2: Search for the source document containing the prefix.**\n        *      │
│  **Tool:** `search_files_content`\n        *   **Purpose:** Efficiently     │
│  locate the file that contains the exact given prefix. Using a significant  │
│  portion of the prefix ensures a precise match.\n        *                  │
│  **Execution:** I will use the last sentence of the prefix to ensure I      │
│  find the exact starting point for the continuation.\n                      │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'However, having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of   │
│  autism and also occurs in non-autistic children.\')`\n\n    *   **Step 3:  │
│  Read the content of the identified source file.**\n        *   **Tool:**   │
│  `read_text_file`\n        *   **Purpose:** Once the file path is           │
│  identified from Step 2, read its entire content into memory for            │
│  processing.\n        *   **Execution:**                                    │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'<path_to_found_file>\')` (The                       │
│  `<path_to_found_file>` will be determined from the output of Step 2).\n\n  │
│  *   **Step 4: Extract and Clean the Continuation.**\n        *             │
│  **Purpose:** Locate the end of the prefix within the full text, then       │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words, carefully skipping non-descriptive   │
│  elements (like headings, lists, meta-text) and cleaning Wikipedia markup   │
│  and HTML entities as demonstrated in the "prior memory" example.\n         │
│  *   **Methodology:**\n            1.  Find the exact end index of the      │
│  prefix in the `full_text`.\n            2.  Extract the raw text           │
│  immediately following the prefix.\n            3.  Iteratively identify    │
│  and append descriptive paragraphs to a `descriptive_blocks` list,          │
│  skipping headings (e.g., `==Heading==`), lists (lines starting with `*`),  │
│  and other non-descriptive elements. The "prior memory" example shows how   │
│  to identify and skip these.\n            4.  Concatenate the               │
│  `descriptive_blocks` into a single string.\n            5.  Apply a        │
│  series of `re.sub` and `str.replace` operations to clean the text:\n       │
│  *   Remove `[[Link|Text]]` -> `Text`\n                *   Remove           │
│  `[[Link]]` -> `Link`\n                *   Remove `[http://... Text]` ->    │
│  `Text`\n                *   Remove `[http://...]` -> `(empty)`\n           │
│  *   Remove `\'\'` (italics) and `\'\'\'` (bold) markers.\n                 │
│  *   Replace HTML entities (`&quot;`, `&amp;mdash;`, `&amp;`).\n            │
│  *   Remove Wikipedia template calls (e.g., `{{main|...}}`,                 │
│  `{{wikiquote|...}}`, `{{note|...}}`, `{{Anarchism}}`, `{{fact}}`).\n       │
│  *   Remove any extra whitespace.\n            6.  Split the cleaned text   │
│  into words and take the first 100-200 words to form the final              │
│  continuation.\n\n3.  **Anticipated Challenges and Mitigation:**\n    *     │
│  **Multiple files containing the prefix:** If `search_files_content`        │
│  returns multiple files, I will prioritize files with names suggesting      │
│  encyclopedic content (e.g., "autism.txt", "wikipedia_autism.md"). If       │
│  still ambiguous, I might need to read and check each candidate file.\n     │
│  *   **Prefix not found:** If the prefix is not found, I will generate a    │
│  continuation based on the current prefix context only, as per the "If ALL  │
│  tools fail" instruction. However, given the detailed prior memory, it\'s   │
│  highly likely the source exists.\n    *   **Complex markup/structure:**    │
│  The "prior memory" provides a robust cleaning strategy. I will adapt and   │
│  extend it if new markup patterns are encountered. The key is to identify   │
│  descriptive paragraphs and exclude structural/meta-elements.\n\n4.         │
│  **Expected Outcome:**\n    A plain text string, 100-200 words long,        │
│  representing the exact, cleaned continuation of the provided prefix from   │
│  its original source document. This output will directly contribute to      │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing highly accurate    │
│  and contextually rich information.\n\n', 'ready': False}                   │

│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │

│  This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic    │

│  fairly controversial. This article uses the term ''autistic'' (see         │

│  There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals      │
│  diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different       │
│  conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the    │
│  [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the        │
│  sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]]    │
│  can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to  │
│  which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic       │
│  person to another.                                                         │

│  Nevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development      │
│  often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment   │
│  as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment    │
│  for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or     │
│  because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.                 │

│  they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a         │
│  finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer         │
│  objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to        │
│  engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the     │
│  first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because    │
│  they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as           │

│  reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek     │
│  comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or        │
│  [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although       │
│  autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of   │
│  this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked  │
│  forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their      │
│  child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment               │
│  theory|attachment]] behavior.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Children with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of       │
│  mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's              │
│  perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age   │
│  of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult             │
│  [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical   │
│  5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge,  │
│  feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g.,    │
│  gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack     │
│  these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to       │
│  predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]]    │
│  of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many   │
│  of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an    │
│  imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in    │
│  non-autistic children.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate   │
│  their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that  │
│  may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism       │
│  generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react      │
│  negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals    │
│  to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior,      │
│  self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.            │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Sensory system===                                                       │
│  A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would  │
│  include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory            │
│  Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will   │
│  exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this  │
│  disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement,    │
│  sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body          │
│  awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or       │
│  verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not      │
│  unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements;           │
│  difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social     │
│  and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language   │
│  delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning                    │
│  difficulties/delays in academic achievement.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│                                                                             │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain      │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability   │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily         │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others        │
│  repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a        │
│  condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are   │
│  a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many      │
│  people                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  My refined plan is as follows:                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Analyze the Prefix and Task Requirements:**                          │
│      *   The prefix discusses "Autism Spectrum Disorders" and their         │
│  characteristics, including social development and the concept of "theory   │
│  of mind." The text contains Wikipedia-style markup (e.g., `[[...]]`,       │
│  `&amp;mdash;`, `&quot;`).                                                  │
│      *   The primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy    │
│  by providing the exact, immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the      │
│  given prefix. This requires precise retrieval and cleaning to ensure       │
│  maximal information density and accuracy.                                  │
│      *   The output must be plain text, free of markdown, analysis,         │
│  commentary, formatting, lists, or headings.                                │
│      *   I have access only to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`           │
│  directory, which limits my search scope to this specific information       │
│  sink.                                                                      │
│      *   The "prior memory" section provides a detailed example of how to   │
│  clean Wikipedia markup and extract specific descriptive blocks while       │
│  skipping meta-text, headings, and lists. This is a critical guide,         │
│  strongly suggesting the source is a Wikipedia article and informing the    │
│  precise extraction and cleaning process.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Strategic Tool Usage and Execution Steps:**                          │
│                                                                             │
│      *   **Step 1: Explore the allowed directory to identify potential      │
│  source files.**                                                            │
│          *   **Tool:** `list_directory`                                     │
│          *   **Purpose:** To get an initial overview of the files present   │
│  in `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This helps in understanding the         │
│  potential source files and confirming the accessible information           │
│  landscape.                                                                 │
│          *   **Execution:**                                                 │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: The `list_directory` tool revealed a `wiki_full.txt` file, which  │
│  is a very strong candidate for the source document, given the              │
│  Wikipedia-like formatting and content of the prefix. The `enwik8_samples`  │
│  directory might also contain relevant data, but `wiki_full.txt` seems      │
│  more direct. I will prioritize searching `wiki_full.txt` first.            │
│  My next step is to read the `wiki_full.txt` file to find the prefix and    │
│  then extract the continuation. Since the file could be large, I will use   │
│  `read_text_file` to get the entire content, then process it in memory to   │
│  find the exact continuation as per the instructions.                       │

│  Thought: Thought: My apologies, it seems I made an assumption about the    │
│  file path. The `list_directory` output showed `wiki_full.txt` directly     │
│  under `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. The error "No such file or           │
│  directory" indicates that the path I provided was incorrect. I should      │
│  re-examine the `list_directory` output carefully.                          │
│  Ah, I see the mistake. The `list_directory` output was:                    │
│  `[DIR] cantrbry`                                                           │

│  This means `wiki_full.txt` is directly in `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`,  │
│  so the path `"/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/wiki_full.txt"` should have     │
│  been correct. The error message is confusing.                              │
│  Let me try `list_directory_with_sizes` to confirm the file exists and its  │
│  size, just in case there's a subtle issue with the file name or            │
│  permissions, although the `list_directory` command itself succeeded. If    │
│  that still fails, I might need to consider if the file is actually within  │
│  one of the subdirectories, despite the `[FILE]` tag.                       │

│  indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would        │
│  include looking for symptoms much like those found in sensory integration  │
│  dysfunction. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal         │
│  sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or      │
│  underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical            │
│  clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily   │
│  distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that  │
│  is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty     │
│  learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one          │
│  situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in speech,  │
│  language or motor skills; specific learning difficulties/delays in         │
│  academic achievement. One common example is an individual with autism      │
│  hearing. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people      │
│  while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may    │
│  be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large   │
│  crowd of people (see cocktail party effect). However, this is perhaps the  │
│  part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so   │
│  these examples may not apply to every autistic. It should be noted that    │
│  sensory difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not     │
│  part of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder. By age 3,    │
│  typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones;     │
│  one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler  │
│  says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or  │
│  she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear    │
│  that the answer is "no." Speech development in people with autism takes    │
│  different paths. Some remain mute throughout their lives while being       │
│  fully literate and able to communicate in other ways—images, sign          │
│  language, and typing are far more natural to them. Some infants who later  │
│  show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life,   │
│  but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as    │
│  late as the teenage years. Still, inability to speak does not mean that    │
│  people with autism are unintelligent or unaware. Once given appropriate    │
│  accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can often be     │
│  found in online chat rooms, discussion boards or websites and even using   │
│  communication devices at autism-community social events such as Autreat.   │
│  Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways, retaining features  │
│  of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout   │
│  their lives. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same    │
│  phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called       │
│  echolalia. Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous       │

Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations. A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in sensory integration dysfunction. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in speech, language or motor skills; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement. One common example is an individual with autism hearing. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see cocktail party effect). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic. It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder. By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling.
