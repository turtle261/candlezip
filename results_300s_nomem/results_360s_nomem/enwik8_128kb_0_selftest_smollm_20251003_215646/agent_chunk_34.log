│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Understand the Task:** The        │
│  primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by finding     │
│  the exact immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the provided text      │
│  prefix. This requires locating the source document within the allowed      │
│  directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. The text prefix strongly         │
│  suggests a Wikipedia article on "Anarchism" due to its formatting (e.g.,   │
│  `[[...]]`, `&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;`, `==Heading==`).\n\n2. **Key       │
│  Steps:**\n    a. **Initial Directory Exploration:** Use                    │
│  `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm the accessible path and then       │
│  `directory_tree()` to map the structure and contents of                    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This will help identify potential source   │
│  files.\n    b. **Content Search:** Employ `search_files_content()` with a  │
│  unique and sufficiently long phrase from the prefix to precisely locate    │
│  the file containing the text. This is critical given the Wikipedia-like    │
│  nature of the content, which is likely to be a single, large document.\n   │
│  c. **File Reading and Extraction:** Once the source file is identified,    │
│  use `read_text_file()` to retrieve its entire content. Then,               │
│  programmatically find the exact position of the prefix and extract the     │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.\n\n3. **Approach to Challenges:**\n    *         │
│  **Tool Limitation:** The prompt mentions "Wikipedia, search tools," but    │
│  the available tools are strictly file system operations. I will strictly   │
│  adhere to the provided `default_api` functions, assuming the "external     │
│  information sources" are contained within                                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    *   **Finding the Exact Prefix:**     │
│  Using a long, unique string from the prefix with `search_files_content`    │
│  will mitigate issues with partial matches or common phrases.\n    *        │
│  **Extracting Verbatim Continuation:** Once the file and prefix location    │
│  are known, standard string manipulation will be used to extract the exact  │
│  subsequent text.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                    │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the base path.\n    *             │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  initial overview of the directory structure and file names, which might    │
│  hint at the source.\n    *                                                 │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'that  │
│  the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs    │
│  of present-day anarchists\')`: This is the most crucial step to pinpoint   │
│  the exact file containing the prefix. I will use a distinct part of the    │
│  prefix as the query.\n    *                                                │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'[identified_file_path]\')`: To read the content of  │
│  the located source file.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text output   │
│  consisting of 100-200 words that immediately follow the provided prefix,   │
│  extracted verbatim from a file within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.      │
│  This outcome directly aligns with the goal of minimizing future token      │
│  prediction entropy by providing precise, context-rich information.\n'}     │

│  - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].    │
│  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how    │
│  to react to, or interact with, other schools. Some, such as                │
│  [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of     │
│  modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view          │
│  opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others  │
│  see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances  │
│  for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''           │

│  :''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]                             │
│  '''Violence.''' Since anarchism has often been associated with violence    │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │
│  people against the                                                         │

│  72/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;                          │
│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │
│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │
│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  '''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny    │
│  P. d'Hericourt]],                                                          │

│  [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph     │
│  Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of        │
│  [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however,   │
│  dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence   │
│  the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism   │
│  for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of           │
│  anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like        │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task:** The primary goal is to minimize future token   │
│  prediction entropy by finding the exact immediate continuation (100-200    │
│  words) of the provided text prefix. This requires locating the source      │
│  document within the allowed directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. The  │
│  text prefix strongly suggests a Wikipedia article on "Anarchism" due to    │
│  its formatting (e.g., `[[...]]`, `&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;`,             │
│  `==Heading==`).                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Initial Directory Exploration:** Use                              │
│  `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm the accessible path and then       │
│  `directory_tree()` to map the structure and contents of                    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This will help identify potential source   │
│  files.                                                                     │
│      b. **Content Search:** Employ `search_files_content()` with a unique   │
│  and sufficiently long phrase from the prefix to precisely locate the file  │
│  containing the text. This is critical given the Wikipedia-like nature of   │
│  the content, which is likely to be a single, large document.               │
│      c. **File Reading and Extraction:** Once the source file is            │
│  identified, use `read_text_file()` to retrieve its entire content. Then,   │
│  programmatically find the exact position of the prefix and extract the     │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│      *   **Tool Limitation:** The prompt mentions "Wikipedia, search        │
│  tools," but the available tools are strictly file system operations. I     │
│  will strictly adhere to the provided `default_api` functions, assuming     │
│  the "external information sources" are contained within                    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                                            │
│      *   **Finding the Exact Prefix:** Using a long, unique string from     │
│  the prefix with `search_files_content` will mitigate issues with partial   │
│  matches or common phrases.                                                 │
│      *   **Extracting Verbatim Continuation:** Once the file and prefix     │
│  location are known, standard string manipulation will be used to extract   │
│  the exact subsequent text.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the base path.            │
│      *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an   │
│  initial overview of the directory structure and file names, which might    │
│  hint at the source.                                                        │

│  query='that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence    │
│  the beliefs of present-day anarchists')`: This is the most crucial step    │
│  to pinpoint the exact file containing the prefix. I will use a distinct    │
│  part of the prefix as the query.                                           │

│  5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text output consisting of 100-200 words   │
│  that immediately follow the provided prefix, extracted verbatim from a     │
│  file within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This outcome directly aligns   │
│  with the goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing   │
│  precise, context-rich information.                                         │

│  '''Atheism''' is, in a broad sense, the absence of belief in the           │
│  existence of [[God]]s. In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the    │
│  position that there are no gods.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  The term ''atheism'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]]          │
│  ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#940;&amp;#952;&amp;#949;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;|&amp;#9  │
│  40;&amp;#952;&amp;#949;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;]]'' (''atheos''), meaning      │
│  &quot;without god(s)&quot;, used as a pejorative term to refer to those    │
│  who denied the gods worshipped by the larger society. With the spread of   │
│  [[free thought]], [[skepticism]], and scientific criticism of              │
│  [[religion]], the term began to acquire a more positive meaning and was    │
│  first used to describe a self-avowed position in the 18th century.         │
│                                                                             │

│  The definition of atheism has varied over time and is still a subject of   │
│  some disagreement. In the past, atheism was often defined as a positive    │
│  assertion of disbelief in God or gods. However, with the rise of           │
│  [[analytic philosophy]] and the increasing recognition of the importance   │
│  of [[burden of proof]], many contemporary atheists prefer to define        │
│  atheism as simply the absence of belief in God or gods. This definition    │
│  places the burden of proof on those who assert the existence of God or     │
│  gods.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Some definitions of atheism also include a rejection of [[supernatural]]   │
│  beliefs in general, not just the belief in gods. Others argue that         │
│  atheism is strictly about the existence of gods, and that other            │
│  supernatural beliefs (such as [[ghost]]s or [[astrology]]) are separate    │
│  issues.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Arguments for atheism==                                                  │
│  Arguments for atheism can be broadly categorized into philosophical,       │
│  scientific, and historical arguments.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Philosophical arguments===                                              │
│  *'''The problem of evil:''' This argument states that the existence of     │
│  evil and suffering in the world is incompatible with the existence of an   │
│  [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], and [[omnibenevolent]] God. If such a God  │
│  existed, he would be able to prevent evil, know about evil, and want to    │
│  prevent evil. Since evil exists, such a God cannot exist.                  │
│  *'''The problem of divine hiddenness:''' This argument states that if God  │
│  exists and desires a relationship with humanity, he would make his         │
│  existence more obvious. The fact that many sincere seekers do not find     │
│  evidence of God's existence suggests that God does not exist.              │
│  *'''Incoherence of the concept of God:''' Some philosophers argue that     │
│  the concept of God, particularly the traditional Abrahamic God with        │
│  properties like omnipotence and omniscience, is inherently contradictory   │
│  or incoherent. For example, can an omnipotent God create a stone so heavy  │
│  that he cannot lift it?                                                    │
│  *'''Lack of evidence:''' Many atheists argue that there is simply no       │
│  compelling evidence for the existence of God or gods. They contend that    │
│  belief in God is based on faith, tradition, or personal experience, none   │
│  of which constitute objective evidence.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Scientific arguments===                                                 │
│  *'''Evolution:''' The theory of [[evolution by natural selection]]         │
│  provides a comprehensive explanation for the diversity of life on Earth    │
│  without the need for a divine creator.                                     │
│  *'''Cosmology:''' Modern [[cosmology]] offers explanations for the origin  │
│  and development of the universe that do not require a supernatural         │
│  intervention.                                                              │
│  *'''Neuroscience:''' Advances in [[neuroscience]] suggest that religious   │
│  experiences and beliefs can be explained by brain activity, rather than    │
│  by external divine influence.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Historical arguments===                                                 │
│  *'''Mythology and cultural relativism:''' The existence of numerous        │
│  diverse [[mythology|mythologies]] and religious beliefs across different   │
│  cultures and historical periods suggests that religions are human          │
│  constructs, rather than divinely revealed truths.                          │
│  *'''Historical criticism of religious texts:''' Critical analysis of       │
│  religious texts often reveals inconsistencies, historical inaccuracies,    │
│  and evidence of human authorship, undermining claims of divine             │
│  inspiration.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Types of atheism==                                                       │
│  Atheism can be further categorized based on the strength of the claim or   │
│  the reasoning behind it.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Strong atheism (positive atheism):''' The explicit affirmation that    │
│  gods do not exist. This is a positive claim about the non-existence of     │
│  gods.                                                                      │
│  *'''Weak atheism (negative atheism):''' The absence of belief in gods,     │
│  without explicitly asserting their non-existence. This is a lack of        │
│  belief, rather than a belief in non-existence.                             │
│  *'''Implicit atheism:''' The absence of theistic belief without a          │
│  conscious rejection of it. This applies to infants, or individuals who     │
│  have never encountered the concept of God.                                 │
│  *'''Explicit atheism:''' The conscious rejection of belief in God or       │
│  gods.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Atheism and related concepts==                                           │
│  *'''Agnosticism:''' The view that the existence of God, of the divine or   │
│  the supernatural is unknown or unknowable. Agnosticism is not a belief     │
│  system in itself, but rather a stance on knowledge. An individual can be   │
│  an agnostic atheist (does not believe in God, but does not claim to know   │
│  for sure that God does not exist) or an agnostic theist (believes in God,  │
│  but does not claim to know for sure that God exists).                      │
│  *'''Antitheism:''' Active opposition to theism. Antitheists may argue      │
│  that belief in God is harmful to individuals and society.                  │
│  *'''Secularism:''' The principle of the separation of government           │
│  institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious    │
│  institutions and religious dignitaries. Secularism does not necessarily    │
│  imply atheism, but many atheists support secularism.                       │
│  *'''Humanism:''' A philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the    │
│  value and agency of human beings, generally preferring critical thinking   │
│  and evidence over established doctrine or faith. Many atheists are         │
│  humanists.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Demographics==                                                           │
│  It is difficult to accurately measure the number of atheists worldwide,    │
│  as definitions vary and many individuals may not openly identify as        │
│  atheist due to social or political pressures. However, surveys and         │
│  studies suggest that atheism is more prevalent in certain regions, such    │
│  as [[Scandinavia]], [[East Asia]], and parts of [[Europe]].                │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Notable atheists==                                                       │
│  Throughout history, many prominent figures have been identified as         │
│  atheists or have expressed views consistent with atheism. These include    │
│  philosophers, scientists, writers, and activists.                          │
│                                                                             │

│  The '''aardvark''' (''Orycteropus afer'') is a medium-sized,               │
│  [[burrow]]ing, [[nocturnal]] [[mammal]] native to [[Africa]]. It is the    │
│  only surviving species of its order, [[Tubulidentata]]. The name           │
│  ''aardvark'' means &quot;earth pig&quot; in [[Afrikaans]] and earlier      │
│  [[Dutch language|Dutch]].                                                  │

│  The aardvark is the only surviving species of the order Tubulidentata,     │
│  though other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known.    │
│  The aardvarks are considered to be [[ungulate]]s. The closest living       │
│  relatives of the aardvark are the [[elephant shrew]]s, [[tenrec]]s and     │
│  [[golden mole]]s. The earliest known fossil remains of ''Orycteropus''     │
│  were found in [[Kenya]] and are 5 million years old, meaning that the      │
│  animal has changed very little since the [[Pliocene]].                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Characteristics==                                                        │
│  The aardvark is a stout, medium-sized animal with a strong body and a      │
│  pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It has a long, sticky     │
│  tongue and powerful claws, which allow it to dig into [[termite]] and      │
│  [[ant]] mounds. The aardvark is the only mammal that has teeth that lack   │
│  enamel and have no pulp cavity; they are composed of some 1500 hexagonal   │
│  prisms of modified [[dentine]], with vertical parallel pulp canals. The    │
│  teeth are continuously growing and are worn away by the animal's diet.     │
│  The aardvark has a keen sense of smell, but its eyesight is poor. It is a  │
│  nocturnal animal, and it is very shy.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  The aardvark is typically 1 to 1.3 meters (3.3 to 4.3 ft) long, with a     │
│  tail of about 70 cm (28 in), and weighs between 60 and 80 kg (130 and 180  │
│  lb). It is a pale yellowish-gray, often stained by soil. Its coat is       │
│  thin, and its skin is tough, which helps protect it from insect bites.     │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Behavior==                                                               │
│  Aardvarks are solitary animals. They emerge from their burrows at night    │
│  to feed. They are primarily [[insectivore]]s, feeding on ants and          │
│  termites. They use their powerful claws to dig into mounds, and their      │
│  long, sticky tongues to lap up the insects. Aardvarks are also known to    │
│  eat other insects, such as [[locust]]s, and occasionally [[fruit]].        │
│                                                                             │
│  Aardvarks are excellent diggers, and they create extensive burrow          │
│  systems. These burrows provide shelter from predators and the elements.    │
│  They are also used as nurseries for their young. Aardvarks typically have  │
│  one offspring per year, after a gestation period of about seven months.    │
│  The young are born in the burrow and remain there for several weeks.       │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Conservation status==                                                    │
│  The aardvark is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the             │
│  [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Although its    │
│  population is stable, it faces threats from [[habitat loss]] and           │
│  [[hunting]].                                                               │

│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│                                                                             │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │

│  Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)                      │

│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │
│  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of   │
│  a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]];    │
│  Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]]   │
│  (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of         │

│  In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years   │
│  later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes    │
│  called the 'First International', united some diverse European             │
│  revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to    │
│  active workers movements the International became signficiant.             │
│                                                                             │
│  From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International:    │
│  he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.     │
│  The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who    │
│  opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his  │
│  followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into    │
│  two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The      │
│  clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists    │
│  around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical     │
│  struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political          │
│  parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers        │
│  focused on parliamentary activity.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted     │
│  that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad    │
│  as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail       │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │

│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │

│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │

│  One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]],  │
│  who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically     │
│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │
│  preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker            │
│  &quot;Dynamost.&quot;                                                      │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │
│  when he refuted Nechaev).                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist     │
│  anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose   │
│  philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian    │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │
│                                                                             │
│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│  The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form    │
│  of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT     │
│  claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes   │

│  include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity    │
│  Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers  │
│  of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary     │
│  critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism       │
│  claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life      │
│  outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim            │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │
│  Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by        │
│  [[Nestor Makhno]]).                                                        │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │
│  International]].                                                           │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of    │
│  'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and     │

│  anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the                │
│  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided,    │
│  with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led   │
│  troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident    │

│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │

│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │

│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  *'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in   │
│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │
│  revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's        │
│  vision at the point of a                                                   │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │
│  has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle      │
│  criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]                        │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  *'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the        │
│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │
│  property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file            │
│  sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the       │

│  *'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to     │
│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │
│  Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as  │
│  an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both   │
│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │

│  state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The          │

│  [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes        │

│  bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The     │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture   │
│  is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as          │
│  anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous       │
│  living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are        │
│  examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:                     │
│                                                                             │

│  * the social historian [[Howard Zinn]]                                     │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │
│  non-capitalist ideas.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for  │
│  the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in   │
│  the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important        │
│  mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United       │
│  Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the      │
│  band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]]   │
│  ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further             │
│  exemplifies this expression.                                               │

│  The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture   │
│  is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as          │
│  anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous       │
│  living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are        │
│  examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:                     │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]]. Militant [[antifa|resistance to        │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │
│  non-capitalist ideas.                                                      │

│  In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity. Most famous for   │
│  the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in   │
│  the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important        │
│  mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message. In the [[United        │
│  Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the      │
│  band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]]   │
│  ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further             │

│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│                                                                             │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │

│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │

│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │
│  first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as               │
│  Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)                      │

│  [[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah  │
│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │
│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │
│  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of   │
│  a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]];    │
│  Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]]   │
│  (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of         │
│  value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]];   │
│  and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker       │
│  strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or     │

│  In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years   │
│  later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes    │
│  called the 'First International', united some diverse European             │
│  revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to    │
│  active workers movements the International became signficiant.             │
│                                                                             │
│  From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International:    │
│  he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.     │
│  The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who    │
│  opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his  │
│  followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into    │
│  two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The      │
│  clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists    │
│  around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical     │
│  struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political          │
│  parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers        │
│  focused on parliamentary activity.                                         │

│  Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted     │
│  that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad    │
│  as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail       │

│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │

│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │

│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │

│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │

│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │

│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │

│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │
│  [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and   │

│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │
│  [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for     │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │
│  has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle      │
│  criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]                        │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  *'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the        │
│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │
│  property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file            │
│  sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the       │

│  *'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to     │
│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │
│  Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as  │
│  an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both   │
│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │
│  view that &quot;war is the health of the                                   │

│  *'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes  │
│  voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the               │
│  state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The          │

│  [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes        │
│  &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor          │
│  bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The     │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │
│  people against the                                                         │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence   │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │

│  The actual *plain text continuation* that follows the prefix, *excluding*  │

│  anarchists. This includes many of their books and other publications.      │
│  Hundreds of anarchists are listed, with short bios, links & dedicated      │
│  pages at the Daily Bleed's Anarchist Encyclopedia. wikipedia page.         │
│  Industrial Workers of the World."                                          │

│  This interpretation removes all the Wikipedia-specific formatting and      │
│  structure, which aligns with "plain text continuation only (no markdown,   │
│  no analysis, no commentary). Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or     │
│  meta-text."                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Let's re-extract based on this strict interpretation.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  The prefix ends with: "The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]]     │
│  further exemplifies this expression."                                      │
│  I will find the index of the end of this string.                           │
│  Then, I will find the next occurrence of actual descriptive text,          │
│  skipping any meta-text, headings, or lists.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Looking at the text after the prefix:                                      │
│  1. `''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]]''` - This is               │
│  meta-text/formatting. Skip.                                                │
│  2. `==See also==` - This is a heading. Skip.                               │
│  3. `<!-- (Please take care in adding to this list that it not grow         │
│  excessively large, consider adding to the list of anarchist concepts       │
│  page) -->` - This is a comment/meta-text. Skip.                            │
│  4. `There are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism, this is a  │
│  brief summary. There is also a more extensive [[list of anarchist          │
│  concepts]].` - This is descriptive text. Start here.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  So the continuation should start with "There are many concepts relevant    │
│  to the topic of anarchism..." and continue for 100-200 words, while still  │
│  avoiding lists and headings.                                               │
│                                                                             │

│  reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist         │

│  accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the  │
│  institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propriété), where owners      │

│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│                                                                             │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

│  Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a        │
│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │

│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │
│  the proprietor of the thing.&quot;                                         │

│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │
│  thought are diverse.                                                       │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │
│  first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as               │
│  Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)                      │

│  [[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah  │
│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │
│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │
│  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of   │
│  a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]];    │
│  Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]]   │
│  (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of         │
│  value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]];   │
│  and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker       │
│  strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or     │

│  In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years   │
│  later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes    │
│  called the 'First International', united some diverse European             │
│  revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to    │
│  active workers movements the International became signficiant.             │
│                                                                             │
│  From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International:    │
│  he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.     │
│  The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who    │
│  opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his  │
│  followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into    │
│  two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The      │
│  clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists    │
│  around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical     │
│  struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political          │
│  parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers        │
│  focused on parliamentary activity.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted     │
│  that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad    │
│  as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail       │

│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │

│                                                                             │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │

│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │

│  Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist     │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │

│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │

│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an                │

│  assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right   │
│  of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is  │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │

│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │
│  [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and   │

│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  *'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in   │
│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │
│  revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's        │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │

│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │

│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │

│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │

│  *'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to     │
│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │

│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │

│  state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The          │

│  bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The     │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │
│  people against the                                                         │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  P. d'Hericourt]],                                                          │

│  dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence   │
│  the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism   │

│  anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like        │
│  [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm   │

│  by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate  │
│  coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third   │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │

│  &quot;without god(s)&quot;, used as a pejorative term to refer to those    │
│  who denied the gods worshipped by the larger society. With the spread of   │
│  [[free thought]], [[skepticism]], and scientific criticism of              │
│  [[religion]], the term began to acquire a more positive meaning and was    │
│  first used to describe a self-avowed position in the 18th century.         │

│  The definition of atheism has varied over time and is still a subject of   │
│  some disagreement. In the past, atheism was often defined as a positive    │
│  assertion of disbelief in God or gods. However, with the rise of           │
│  [[analytic philosophy]] and the increasing recognition of the importance   │
│  of [[burden of proof]], many contemporary atheists prefer to define        │
│  atheism as simply the absence of belief in God or gods. This definition    │
│  places the burden of proof on those who assert the existence of God or     │
│  gods.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Some definitions of atheism also include a rejection of [[supernatural]]   │
│  beliefs in general, not just the belief in gods. Others argue that         │
│  atheism is strictly about the existence of gods, and that other            │
│  supernatural beliefs (such as [[ghost]]s or [[astrology]]) are separate    │
│  issues.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Arguments for atheism==                                                  │
│  Arguments for atheism can be broadly categorized into philosophical,       │
│  scientific, and historical arguments.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Philosophical arguments===                                              │
│  *'''The problem of evil:''' This argument states that the existence of     │
│  evil and suffering in the world is incompatible with the existence of an   │
│  [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], and [[omnibenevolent]] God. If such a God  │
│  existed, he would be able to prevent evil, know about evil, and want to    │
│  prevent evil. Since evil exists, such a God cannot exist.                  │
│  *'''The problem of divine hiddenness:''' This argument states that if God  │
│  exists and desires a relationship with humanity, he would make his         │
│  existence more obvious. The fact that many sincere seekers do not find     │
│  evidence of God's existence suggests that God does not exist.              │
│  *'''Incoherence of the concept of God:''' Some philosophers argue that     │
│  the concept of God, particularly the traditional Abrahamic God with        │
│  properties like omnipotence and omniscience, is inherently contradictory   │
│  or incoherent. For example, can an omnipotent God create a stone so heavy  │
│  that he cannot lift it?                                                    │
│  *'''Lack of evidence:''' Many atheists argue that there is simply no       │
│  compelling evidence for the existence of God or gods. They contend that    │
│  belief in God is based on faith, tradition, or personal experience, none   │
│  of which constitute objective evidence.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Scientific arguments===                                                 │
│  *'''Evolution:''' The theory of [[evolution by natural selection]]         │
│  provides a comprehensive explanation for the diversity of life on Earth    │
│  without the need for a divine creator.                                     │
│  *'''Cosmology:''' Modern [[cosmology]] offers explanations for the origin  │
│  and development of the universe that do not require a supernatural         │
│  intervention.                                                              │
│  *'''Neuroscience:''' Advances in [[neuroscience]] suggest that religious   │
│  experiences and beliefs can be explained by brain activity, rather than    │
│  by external divine influence.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Historical arguments===                                                 │
│  *'''Mythology and cultural relativism:''' The existence of numerous        │
│  diverse [[mythology|mythologies]] and religious beliefs across different   │
│  cultures and historical periods suggests that religions are human          │
│  constructs, rather than divinely revealed truths.                          │
│  *'''Historical criticism of religious texts:''' Critical analysis of       │
│  religious texts often reveals inconsistencies, historical inaccuracies,    │
│  and evidence of human authorship, undermining claims of divine             │
│  inspiration.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Types of atheism==                                                       │
│  Atheism can be further categorized based on the strength of the claim or   │
│  the reasoning behind it.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Strong atheism (positive atheism):''' The explicit affirmation that    │
│  gods do not exist. This is a positive claim about the non-existence of     │
│  gods.                                                                      │
│  *'''Weak atheism (negative atheism):''' The absence of belief in gods,     │
│  without explicitly asserting their non-existence. This is a lack of        │
│  belief, rather than a belief in non-existence.                             │
│  *'''Implicit atheism:''' The absence of theistic belief without a          │
│  conscious rejection of it. This applies to infants, or individuals who     │
│  have never encountered the concept of God.                                 │
│  *'''Explicit atheism:''' The conscious rejection of belief in God or       │
│  gods.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Atheism and related concepts==                                           │
│  *'''Agnosticism:''' The view that the existence of God, of the divine or   │
│  the supernatural is unknown or unknowable. Agnosticism is not a belief     │
│  system in itself, but rather a stance on knowledge. An individual can be   │
│  an agnostic atheist (does not believe in God, but does not claim to know   │
│  for sure that God does not exist) or an agnostic theist (believes in God,  │
│  but does not claim to know for sure that God exists).                      │
│  *'''Antitheism:''' Active opposition to theism. Antitheists may argue      │
│  that belief in God is harmful to individuals and society.                  │
│  *'''Secularism:''' The principle of the separation of government           │
│  institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious    │
│  institutions and religious dignitaries. Secularism does not necessarily    │
│  imply atheism, but many atheists support secularism.                       │
│  *'''Humanism:''' A philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the    │
│  value and agency of human beings, generally preferring critical thinking   │
│  and evidence over established doctrine or faith. Many atheists are         │
│  humanists.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Demographics==                                                           │
│  It is difficult to accurately measure the number of atheists worldwide,    │
│  as definitions vary and many individuals may not openly identify as        │
│  atheist due to social or political pressures. However, surveys and         │
│  studies suggest that atheism is more prevalent in certain regions, such    │
│  as [[Scandinavia]], [[East Asia]], and parts of [[Europe]].                │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Notable atheists==                                                       │
│  Throughout history, many prominent figures have been identified as         │
│  atheists or have expressed views consistent with atheism. These include    │
│  philosophers, scientists, writers, and activists.                          │
│                                                                             │

│  The '''aardvark''' (''Orycteropus afer'') is a medium-sized,               │
│  [[burrow]]ing, [[nocturnal]] [[mammal]] native to [[Africa]]. It is the    │
│  only surviving species of its order, [[Tubulidentata]]. The name           │
│  ''aardvark'' means &quot;earth pig&quot; in [[Afrikaans]] and earlier      │
│  [[Dutch language|Dutch]].                                                  │

│  The aardvark is the only surviving species of the order Tubulidentata,     │
│  though other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known.    │
│  The aardvarks are considered to be [[ungulate]]s. The closest living       │
│  relatives of the aardvark are the [[elephant shrew]]s, [[tenrec]]s and     │
│  [[golden mole]]s. The earliest known fossil remains of ''Orycteropus''     │
│  were found in [[Kenya]] and are 5 million years old, meaning that the      │
│  animal has changed very little since the [[Pliocene]].                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Characteristics==                                                        │
│  The aardvark is a stout, medium-sized animal with a strong body and a      │
│  pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It has a long, sticky     │
│  tongue and powerful claws, which allow it to dig into [[termite]] and      │
│  [[ant]] mounds. The aardvark is the only mammal that has teeth that lack   │
│  enamel and have no pulp cavity; they are composed of some 1500 hexagonal   │
│  prisms of modified [[dentine]], with vertical parallel pulp canals. The    │
│  teeth are continuously growing and are worn away by the animal's diet.     │
│  The aardvark has a keen sense of smell, but its eyesight is poor. It is a  │
│  nocturnal animal, and it is very shy.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  The aardvark is typically 1 to 1.3 meters (3.3 to 4.3 ft) long, with a     │
│  tail of about 70 cm (28 in), and weighs between 60 and 80 kg (130 and 180  │
│  lb). It is a pale yellowish-gray, often stained by soil. Its coat is       │
│  thin, and its skin is tough, which helps protect it from insect bites.     │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Behavior==                                                               │
│  Aardvarks are solitary animals. They emerge from their burrows at night    │
│  to feed. They are primarily [[insectivore]]s, feeding on ants and          │
│  termites. They use their powerful claws to dig into mounds, and their      │
│  long, sticky tongues to lap up the insects. Aardvarks are also known to    │
│  eat other insects, such as [[locust]]s, and occasionally [[fruit]].        │
│                                                                             │
│  Aardvarks are excellent diggers, and they create extensive burrow          │
│  systems. These burrows provide shelter from predators and the elements.    │
│  They are also used as nurseries for their young. Aardvarks typically have  │
│  one offspring per year, after a gestation period of about seven months.    │
│  The young are born in the burrow and remain there for several weeks.       │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Conservation status==                                                    │
│  The aardvark is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the             │
│  [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Although its    │
│  population is stable, it faces threats from [[habitat loss]] and           │
│  [[hunting]].                                                               │

│  The aardvark is a well-known animal in Africa, and it is often featured    │
│  in [[folklore]] and [[children's literature]]. It is also the subject of   │
│  the popular [[cartoon]] character [[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur Read]].      │

│                                                                             │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │

│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │

│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │

│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │
│  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of   │
│  a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]];    │
│  Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]]   │
│  (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of         │

│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │

│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │

│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │

│  One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]],  │
│  who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically     │
│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │

│  &quot;Dynamost.&quot;                                                      │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │
│  when he refuted Nechaev).                                                  │

│  Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist     │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │
│                                                                             │
│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │
│  Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by        │
│  [[Nestor Makhno]]).                                                        │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │

│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │
│  Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy   │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  *'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in   │
│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │
│  revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's        │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │
│  has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle      │
│  criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]                        │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  *'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the        │
│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │
│  property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file            │

│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │
│  Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as  │
│  an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both   │
│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │

│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │

│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │

│  The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture   │
│  is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as          │
│  anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous       │
│  living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are        │
│  examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:                     │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │
│  non-capitalist ideas.                                                      │

│  In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for  │
│  the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in   │
│  the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important        │
│  mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United       │
│  Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the      │
│  band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]]   │
│  ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further             │

│  The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture   │
│  is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as          │
│  anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous       │
│  living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are        │
│  examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:                     │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]]. Militant [[antifa|resistance to        │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │
│  non-capitalist ideas.                                                      │

│  In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity. Most famous for   │
│  the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in   │
│  the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important        │
│  mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message. In the [[United        │
│  Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the      │
│  band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]]   │
│  ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further             │

│  [[working class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English  │
│  Revolution]] and the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French    │
│  Revolution]].[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.  │

│  ''&quot;any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of     │
│  society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zhis  │

│  Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also     │
│  been taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.              │

│  Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]], is the belief that ''rulers''     │
│  are unnecessary and should be abolished, although there are differing      │
│  interpretations of what this means. Anarchism also refers to related       │
│  [[social movement]]s) that advocate the elimination of authoritarian       │
│  institutions, particularly the                                             │

│  [[chaos]], [[nihilism]], or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious            │
│  [[anti-authoritarian]] society. In place of what are regarded as           │

│  While anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists   │
│  also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free        │
│  society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary     │

│  But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term          │

│  published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term                  │

│  reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist         │

│  accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the  │
│  institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propriété), where owners      │

│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│                                                                             │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

│  Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a        │
│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │
│  interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see   │

│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │
│  the proprietor of the thing.&quot;                                         │

│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │
│  first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as               │
│  Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)                      │

│  [[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah  │
│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │
│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │
│  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of   │
│  a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]];    │
│  Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]]   │
│  (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of         │
│  value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]];   │
│  and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker       │
│  strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or     │

│  In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years   │
│  later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes    │
│  called the 'First International', united some diverse European             │
│  revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to    │
│  active workers movements the International became signficiant.             │
│                                                                             │
│  From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International:    │
│  he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.     │
│  The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who    │
│  opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his  │
│  followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into    │
│  two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The      │
│  clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists    │
│  around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical     │
│  struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political          │
│  parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers        │
│  focused on parliamentary activity.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted     │
│  that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad    │
│  as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail       │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │

│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │

│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │

│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │

│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │

│  [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no      │
│  higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as        │
│  [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus'          │
│  teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when                │
│  &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome.       │

│  Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's       │
│  birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such  │
│  as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the     │
│  Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth    │
│  century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic     │
│  organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure   │
│  capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in    │
│  theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists  │
│  in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the          │

│  as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.           │

│  though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de       │
│  Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an                │
│  individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to      │
│  assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right   │
│  of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is  │
│  annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant        │
│  competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always    │
│  exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish  │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │

│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │

│  [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions.  │
│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │
│  [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for     │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in   │
│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │
│  revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's        │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │
│  has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle      │
│  criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]                        │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  *'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the        │
│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │
│  property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file            │

│  *'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to     │
│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │
│  Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as  │
│  an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both   │
│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │

│  state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.h  │

│  *'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes  │
│  voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the               │
│  state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The          │

│  bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The     │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │
│  people against the                                                         │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in   │
│  the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important        │
│  mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United       │
│  Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the      │
│  band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]]   │
│  ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further             │
│  exemplifies this expression.                                               │

│  The actual *plain text continuation* that follows the prefix, *excluding*  │

│                                                                             │

│  The following is a sample of books that have been referenced in this       │

│  anarchists. This includes many of their books and other publications.      │
│  Hundreds of anarchists are listed, with short bios, links & dedicated      │
│  pages at the Daily Bleed's Anarchist Encyclopedia. wikipedia page.         │
│  Industrial Workers of the World."                                          │

│  This interpretation removes all the Wikipedia-specific formatting and      │
│  structure, which aligns with "plain text continuation only (no markdown,   │
│  no analysis, no commentary). Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or     │
│  meta-text."                                                                │

│  Let's re-extract based on this strict interpretation.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  The prefix ends with: "The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]]     │
│  further exemplifies this expression."                                      │
│  I will find the index of the end of this string.                           │
│  Then, I will find the next occurrence of actual descriptive text,          │
│  skipping any meta-text, headings, or lists.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Looking at the text after the prefix:                                      │
│  1. `''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]]''` - This is               │
│  meta-text/formatting. Skip.                                                │
│  2. `==See also==` - This is a heading. Skip.                               │
│  3. `<!-- (Please take care in adding to this list that it not grow         │
│  excessively large, consider adding to the list of anarchist concepts       │
│  page) -->` - This is a comment/meta-text. Skip.                            │
│  4. `There are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism, this is a  │
│  brief summary. There is also a more extensive [[list of anarchist          │
│  concepts]].` - This is descriptive text. Start here.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  So the continuation should start with "There are many concepts relevant    │
│  to the topic of anarchism..." and continue for 100-200 words, while still  │
│  avoiding lists and headings.                                               │
│                                                                             │

│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│                                                                             │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │

│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │

│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │
│  first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as               │
│  Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)                      │

│  [[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah  │
│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │
│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │
│  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of   │
│  a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]];    │
│  Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]]   │
│  (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of         │
│  value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]];   │
│  and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker       │
│  strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or     │

│  In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years   │
│  later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes    │
│  called the 'First International', united some diverse European             │
│  revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to    │
│  active workers movements the International became signficiant.             │
│                                                                             │
│  From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International:    │
│  he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.     │
│  The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who    │
│  opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his  │
│  followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into    │
│  two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The      │
│  clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists    │
│  around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical     │
│  struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political          │
│  parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers        │
│  focused on parliamentary activity.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted     │
│  that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad    │
│  as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail       │

│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │

│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │

│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │

│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │

│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │

│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │

│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │

│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │

│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │

│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │

│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │
│  people against the                                                         │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │

│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate  │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │

In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no gods.\n\nThe term ''atheism'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#940;&amp;#952;&amp;#949;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;|&amp;#940;&amp;#952;&amp;#949;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;]]'' (''atheos''), meaning &quot;without god(s)&quot;, used as a pejorative term to refer to those who denied the gods worshipped by the larger society. With the spread of [[free thought]], [[skepticism]], and scientific criticism of [[religion]], the term began to acquire a more positive meaning and was first used to describe a self-avowed position in the 18th century.\n\n==Scope and definitions==\n[[Image:Bertrand Russell.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Bertrand Russell]] (1872-1970)]]\nThe definition of atheism has varied over time and is still a subject of some disagreement. In the past, atheism was often defined as a positive assertion of disbelief in God or gods. However, with the rise of [[analytic philosophy]] and the increasing recognition of the importance of [[burden of proof]], many contemporary atheists prefer to define atheism as simply the absence of belief in God or gods. This definition places the burden of proof on those who assert the existence of God or gods.\n\nSome definitions of atheism also include a rejection of [[supernatural]] beliefs in general, not just the belief in gods. Others argue that atheism is strictly about the existence of gods, and that other supernatural beliefs (such as [[ghost]]s or [[astrology]]) are separate issues.\n\n==Arguments for atheism==\nArguments for atheism can be broadly categorized into philosophical, scientific, and historical arguments.\n\n===Philosophical arguments===\n*'''The problem of evil:''' This argument states that the existence of evil and suffering in the world is incompatible with the existence of an [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], and [[omnibenevolent]] God. If such a God existed, he would be able to prevent evil, know about evil, and want to prevent evil. Since evil exists, such a God cannot exist.\n*'''The problem of divine hiddenness:''' This argument states that if God exists and desires a relationship with humanity, he would make his existence more obvious. The fact that many sincere seekers do not find evidence of God's existence suggests that God does not exist.\n*'''Incoherence of the concept of God:''' Some philosophers argue that the concept of God, particularly the traditional Abrahamic God with properties like omnipotence and omniscience, is inherently contradictory or incoherent. For example, can an omnipotent God create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it?\n*'''Lack of evidence:''' Many atheists argue that there is simply no compelling evidence for the existence of God or gods. They contend that belief in God is based on faith, tradition, or personal experience, none of which constitute objective evidence.\n\n===Scientific arguments===\n*'''Evolution:''' The theory of [[evolution by natural selection]] provides a comprehensive explanation for the diversity of life on Earth without the need for a divine creator.\n*'''Cosmology:''' Modern [[cosmology]] offers explanations for the origin and development of the universe that do not require a supernatural intervention.\n*'''Neuroscience:''' Advances in [[neuroscience]] suggest that religious experiences and beliefs can be explained by brain activity, rather than by external divine influence.\n\n===Historical arguments===\n*'''Mythology and cultural relativism:''' The existence of numerous diverse [[mythology|mythologies]] and religious beliefs across different cultures and historical periods suggests that religions are human constructs, rather than divinely revealed truths.\n*'''Historical criticism of religious texts:''' Critical analysis of religious texts often reveals inconsistencies, historical inaccuracies, and evidence of human authorship, undermining claims of divine inspiration.\n\n==Types of atheism==\nAtheism can be further categorized based on the strength of the claim or the reasoning behind it.\n\n*'''Strong atheism (positive atheism):''' The explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. This is a positive claim about the non-existence of gods.\n*'''Weak atheism (negative atheism):''' The absence of belief in gods, without explicitly asserting their non-existence. This is a lack of belief, rather than a belief in non-existence.\n*'''Implicit atheism:''' The absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it. This applies to infants, or individuals who have never encountered the concept of God.\n*'''Explicit atheism:''' The conscious rejection of belief in God or gods.\n\n==Atheism and related concepts==\n*'''Agnosticism:''' The view that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable. Agnosticism is not a belief system in itself, but rather a stance on knowledge. An individual can be an agnostic atheist (does not believe in God, but does not claim to know for sure that God does not exist) or an agnostic theist (believes in God, but does not claim to know for sure that God exists).\n*'''Antitheism:''' Active opposition to theism. Antitheists may argue that belief in God is harmful to individuals and society.\n*'''Secularism:''' The principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institutions and religious dignitaries. Secularism does not necessarily imply atheism, but many atheists support secularism.\n*'''Humanism:''' A philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, generally preferring critical thinking and evidence over established doctrine or faith. Many atheists are humanists.\n\n==Demographics==\nIt is difficult to accurately measure the number of atheists worldwide, as definitions vary and many individuals may not openly identify as atheist due to social or political pressures. However, surveys and studies suggest that atheism is more prevalent in certain regions, such as [[Scandinavia]], [[East Asia]], and parts of [[Europe]].\n\n==Notable atheists==\nThroughout history, many prominent figures have been identified as atheists or have expressed views consistent with atheism.

It is the only surviving species of its order, [[Tubulidentata]]. The name ''aardvark'' means &quot;earth pig&quot; in [[Afrikaans]] and earlier [[Dutch language|Dutch]].\n\nThe aardvark is the only surviving species of the order Tubulidentata, though other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. The aardvarks are considered to be [[ungulate]]s. The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the [[elephant shrew]]s, [[tenrec]]s and [[golden mole]]s. The earliest known fossil remains of ''Orycteropus'' were found in [[Kenya]] and are 5 million years old, meaning that the animal has changed very little since the [[Pliocene]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe aardvark is a stout, medium-sized animal with a strong body and a pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It has a long, sticky tongue and powerful claws, which allow it to dig into [[termite]] and [[ant]] mounds. The aardvark is the only mammal that has teeth that lack enamel and have no pulp cavity; they are composed of some 1500 hexagonal prisms of modified [[dentine]], with vertical parallel pulp canals. The teeth are continuously growing and are worn away by the animal's diet. The aardvark has a keen sense of smell, but its eyesight is poor. It is a nocturnal animal, and it is very shy.\n\nThe aardvark is typically 1 to 1.3 meters (3.3 to 4.3 ft) long, with a tail of about 70 cm (28 in), and weighs between 60 and 80 kg (130 and 180 lb). It is a pale yellowish-gray, often stained by soil. Its coat is thin, and its skin is tough, which helps protect it from insect bites.\n\n==Behavior==\nAardvarks are solitary animals. They emerge from their burrows at night to feed. They are primarily [[insectivore]]s, feeding on ants and termites. They use their powerful claws to dig into mounds, and their long, sticky tongues to lap up the insects. Aardvarks are also known to eat other insects, such as [[locust]]s, and occasionally [[fruit]].\n\nAardvarks are excellent diggers, and they create extensive burrow systems. These burrows provide shelter from predators and the elements. They are also used as nurseries for their young. Aardvarks typically have one offspring per year, after a gestation period of about seven months. The young are born in the burrow and remain there for several weeks.\n\n==Conservation status==\nThe aardvark is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Although its population is stable, it faces threats from [[habitat loss]] and [[hunting]].\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe aardvark is a well-known animal in Africa, and it is often featured in [[folklore]] and [[children's literature]]. It is also the subject of the popular [[cartoon]] character [[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur Read]].\n\n[[Category:Mammals of Africa]]\n[[Category:Monotypic mammal genera]]\n[[Category:Tubulidentata]]\n[[Category:IUCN Red List least concern species]]\n\n[[af:Aardvark]]\n[[ar:\u062e\u0646\u0632\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636]]\n[[bg:\u0422\u0440\u044a\u0431\u043e\u0437\u044a\u0431]]\n[[ca:Orict\u00e8rop]]\n[[cs:Hraba\u010d]]\n[[da:Jordsvin]]\n[[de:Erdferkel]]\n[[es:Orycteropus afer]]\n[[eo:Termitoman\u011dulo]]\n[[fr:Oryct\u00e9rope]]\n[[gl:Orict\u00e9ropo]]\n[[ko:\ub545\ub3fc\uc9c0]]\n[[hr:Aardvark]]\n[[id:Aardvark]]\n[[it:Orycteropus afer]]\n[[he:\u05e9\u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05d1]]\n[[hu:F\u00f6ldimalac]]\n[[nl:Aardvarken]]\n[[ja:\u30c4\u30c1\u30d6\u30bf]]\n[[no:Jordsvin]]\n[[pl:Mr\u00f3wnik]]\n[[pt:Orict\u00e9ropo]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043a\u043e\u0437\u0443\u0431]]\n[[simple:Aardvark]]\n[[sk:Hraba\u010d]]\n[[sr:\u0410\u0440\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043a]]\n[[fi:Maasika]]\n[[sv:Jordsvin]]\n[[th:\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e14\u0e27\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e01]]\n[[tr:Aardvark]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u8c5a]]</text>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>Anarchism</title>\n    <id>43</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>42136831</id>\n      <timestamp>2006-03-04T01:41:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>CJames745</username>\n        <id>832382</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor />\n      <comment>/* Anarchist Communism */  too many brackets</comment>\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">{{Anarchism}}\n'''Anarchism''' originated as a term of abuse first used against early [[working class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English Revolution]] and the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French Revolution]].[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html] Whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe ''&quot;any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zhistorintpolency.html History of International Police Cooperation], from the final protocols of the &quot;International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also been taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.\n\nThe word '''anarchism''' is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;|&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;]]'' (&quot;without [[archon]]s (ruler, chief, king)&quot;). Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]], is the belief that ''rulers'' are unnecessary and should be abolished, although there are differing interpretations of what this means. Anarchism also refers to related [[social movement]]s) that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions, particularly the [[state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Definitions_of_anarchism Definitions of anarchism] on Wikiquote, accessed 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[anarchy]],&quot; as most anarchists use it, does not imply [[chaos]], [[nihilism]], or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious [[anti-authoritarian]] society. In place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions, anarchists advocate social relations based upon [[voluntary association]] of autonomous individuals, [[mutual aid]], and [[self-governance]]. \n    \nWhile anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics; there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about. \n\n== Origins and predecessors ==\n\n[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], and others, argue that before recorded [[history]], human society was organized on anarchist principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter.

[[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''History of Western Philosophy'', writes that the Anabaptists &quot;repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by [[the Holy Spirit]]...[f]rom this premise they arrive at [[communism]]....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], Bertrand.

[[Russell Means]], a [[libertarian]] and leader in the [[American Indian Movement]], has repeatedly stated that he is &quot;an anarchist, and so are all [his] ancestors.&quot;\n\nIn 1793, in the thick of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] published ''An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html]. Although Godwin did not use the word ''anarchism'', many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism.&quot; But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term ''anarchiste'' was known mainly as an insult hurled by the [[bourgeois]] [[Girondins]] at more radical elements in the [[French revolution]].\n\n==The first self-labelled anarchist==\n[[Image:Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.jpg|110px|thumb|left|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]\n{{main articles|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]}}\n\nIt is commonly held that it wasn't until [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propri\u00e9t\u00e9), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called 'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources, capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice. \n\nProudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]] (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.\n\nProudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|here]].''\n\n==Max Stirner's Egoism==\n{{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}\n\nIn his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;\n\nStirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.\n\n==American individualist anarchism==\n[[Image:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]\n{{main articles|[[Individualist anarchism]] and [[American individualist anarchism]]}}\n\nIn 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]] experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)\n\n[[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty'' from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]]; Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]] (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]]; and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]], Benjamin.

He argued that in a truly free market system without the state, the abundance of  competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor. \n\nOther 19th century individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], and [[Victor Yarros]].\n\n==The First International==\n[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin 1814-1876]]]]\n{{main articles|[[International Workingmen's Association]], [[Anarchism and Marxism]]}}\n\nIn Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes called the 'First International', united some diverse European revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to active workers movements the International became signficiant. \n\nFrom the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International: he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.   The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity.\n\nBakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], Mikhail. ''&quot;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/adpage.php?id=1969 Statism and Anarchy]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]]. This is often cited as the origin of the [[Anarchist_objections_to_marxism|conflict between anarchists and Marxists]]. From this moment the ''[[Social democracy|social democratic]]'' and ''[[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]]'' currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival [[List of left-wing internationals|'internationals'.]]\n\n==Anarchist Communism==\n{{main|Anarchist communism}}\n[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]\n\nProudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]\n\nAn early anarchist communist was Joseph D\u00e9jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle - Lettre \u00e0 P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D\u00e9jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).\n\nPeter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.\n\nSome anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Propaganda of the deed==\n[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]\n{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}\n\nAnarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. \n\nOne of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  \n\nHowever, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).\n\nOther anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].\n\n==Anarchism in the labour movement==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]\n\n[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.\n\nAfter the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.\n\n[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]\n\nSpanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].\n\nSyndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].\n\nContemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  \n\nThe largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.\n\n==The Russian Revolution==\n{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. \n\nThe ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.\n\n==The fight against fascism==\n{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}\n[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:\n\n:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}\n\nIn France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. \n\nIn reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''\n\n==Religious anarchism==\n[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]\n{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}\n\nMost anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.\n\n[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.\n\nChristian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.\n\n[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].\n\n[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].\n\n==Anarchism and feminism==\n[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]\n{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}\n\nEarly [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'H\u00e9ricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.\n \nAnarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}\n\nAnarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  \n\nAnarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.\n\nIn the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Anarcho-capitalism==\n[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]\n{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}\nAnarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.\n\n[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M.

For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.\n\n==Anarchism and the environment==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}\n\nPrimitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.\n\n==Other branches and offshoots==\nAnarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.\n\n[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]\n*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]\n\n*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]\n\n*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]\n\n*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]\n\n==Other issues==\n*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]\n\n*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.\n\n*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.\n\n*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.\n\n*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism.

[[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.\n\n*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).\n\n*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''\n\n==Criticisms of anarchism==\n:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]\n\n'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:\n:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; \n\n'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.\n\n'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Hypocrisy.'''

While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists.

class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English Revolution]] and the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French Revolution]].[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html] Whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe ''&quot;any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zhistorintpolency.html History of International Police Cooperation], from the final protocols of the &quot;International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also been taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.\n\nThe word '''anarchism''' is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;|&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;]]'' (&quot;without [[archon]]s (ruler, chief, king)&quot;). Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]], is the belief that ''rulers'' are unnecessary and should be abolished, although there are differing interpretations of what this means. Anarchism also refers to related [[social movement]]s) that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions, particularly the [[state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Definitions_of_anarchism Definitions of anarchism] on Wikiquote, accessed 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[anarchy]],&quot; as most anarchists use it, does not imply [[chaos]], [[nihilism]], or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious [[anti-authoritarian]] society. In place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions, anarchists advocate social relations based upon [[voluntary association]] of autonomous individuals, [[mutual aid]], and [[self-governance]]. \n    \nWhile anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics; there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about. \n\n== Origins and predecessors ==\n\n[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], and others, argue that before recorded [[history]], human society was organized on anarchist principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter. ''&quot;[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]&quot;'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthropologists follow Kropotkin and Engels in believing that hunter-gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour, accumulated wealth, or decreed law, and had equal access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Freidrich. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]&quot;'', 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|William Godwin]]\n\nAnarchists including the [[The Anarchy Organisation]] and [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] find anarchist attitudes in [[Taoism]] from [[History of China|Ancient China]].&lt;ref&gt;The Anarchy Organization (Toronto).

According to Kropotkin, Zeno &quot;repudiated the omnipotence of the state, its intervention and regimentation, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html Anarchism], written by Peter Kropotkin, from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe [[Anabaptist]]s of 16th century Europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism. [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''History of Western Philosophy'', writes that the Anabaptists &quot;repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by [[the Holy Spirit]]...[f]rom this premise they arrive at [[communism]]....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], Bertrand. ''&quot;Ancient philosophy&quot;'' in ''A History of Western Philosophy, and its connection with political and social circumstances from the earliest times to the present day'', 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diggers (True Levellers)|The Diggers]] or &quot;True Levellers&quot; were an early communistic movement during the time of the [[English Civil War]], and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zpub.com/notes/aan-hist.html An Anarchist Timeline], from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the [[modern era]], the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan]] in his ''Nouveaux voyages dans l'Am\u00e9rique septentrionale'', (1703), where he described the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous American]] society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-12 Dictionary of the History of Ideas - ANARCHISM]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Russell Means]], a [[libertarian]] and leader in the [[American Indian Movement]], has repeatedly stated that he is &quot;an anarchist, and so are all [his] ancestors.&quot;\n\nIn 1793, in the thick of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] published ''An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html]. Although Godwin did not use the word ''anarchism'', many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism.&quot; But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term ''anarchiste'' was known mainly as an insult hurled by the [[bourgeois]] [[Girondins]] at more radical elements in the [[French revolution]].\n\n==The first self-labelled anarchist==\n[[Image:Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.jpg|110px|thumb|left|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]\n{{main articles|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]}}\n\nIt is commonly held that it wasn't until [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propri\u00e9t\u00e9), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called 'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources, capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice. \n\nProudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]] (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.\n\nProudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|here]].''\n\n==Max Stirner's Egoism==\n{{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}\n\nIn his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;\n\nStirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.\n\n==American individualist anarchism==\n[[Image:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]\n{{main articles|[[Individualist anarchism]] and [[American individualist anarchism]]}}\n\nIn 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]] experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)\n\n[[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty'' from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]]; Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]] (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]]; and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]], Benjamin.

He argued that in a truly free market system without the state, the abundance of  competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor. \n\nOther 19th century individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], and [[Victor Yarros]].\n\n==The First International==\n[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin 1814-1876]]]]\n{{main articles|[[International Workingmen's Association]], [[Anarchism and Marxism]]}}\n\nIn Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes called the 'First International', united some diverse European revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to active workers movements the International became signficiant. \n\nFrom the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International: he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.   The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity.\n\nBakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], Mikhail. ''&quot;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/adpage.php?id=1969 Statism and Anarchy]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]]. This is often cited as the origin of the [[Anarchist_objections_to_marxism|conflict between anarchists and Marxists]]. From this moment the ''[[Social democracy|social democratic]]'' and ''[[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]]'' currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival [[List of left-wing internationals|'internationals'.]]\n\n==Anarchist Communism==\n{{main|Anarchist communism}}\n[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]\n\nProudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]\n\nAn early anarchist communist was Joseph D\u00e9jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle - Lettre \u00e0 P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D\u00e9jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).\n\nPeter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.\n\nSome anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Propaganda of the deed==\n[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]\n{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}\n\nAnarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. \n\nOne of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  \n\nHowever, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).\n\nOther anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].\n\n==Anarchism in the labour movement==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]\n\n[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.\n\nAfter the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.\n\n[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]\n\nSpanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].\n\nSyndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].\n\nContemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  \n\nThe largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.\n\n==The Russian Revolution==\n{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. \n\nThe ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.\n\n==The fight against fascism==\n{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}\n[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:\n\n:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}\n\nIn France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. \n\nIn reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''\n\n==Religious anarchism==\n[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]\n{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}\n\nMost anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.\n\n[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.\n\nChristian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.\n\n[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].\n\n[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].\n\n==Anarchism and feminism==\n[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]\n{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}\n\nEarly [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'H\u00e9ricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.\n \nAnarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}\n\nAnarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  \n\nAnarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.\n\nIn the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Anarcho-capitalism==\n[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]\n{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}\nAnarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.\n\n[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de.

For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.\n\n==Anarchism and the environment==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}\n\nPrimitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.\n\n==Other branches and offshoots==\nAnarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.\n\n[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]\n*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]\n\n*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]\n\n*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]\n\n*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]\n\n==Other issues==\n*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]\n\n*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.\n\n*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.\n\n*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.\n\n*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].\n\n*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.\n\n*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).\n\n*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''\n\n==Criticisms of anarchism==\n:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]\n\n'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:\n:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; \n\n'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.\n\n'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Cultural phenomena==\n[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928\u2013)]]\nThe kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently \u00e9litist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:\n\n* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]\n* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]\n* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] \n* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]\n* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicol\u00e1s Rossell\u00f3]]\n\nIn [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   \n\nIn various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.\n''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]]''\n\n==See also==\n&lt;!-- (Please take care in adding to this list that it not grow excessively large, consider adding to the list of anarchist concepts page) --&gt;\nThere are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism, this is a brief summary.

class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English Revolution]] and the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French Revolution]].[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html] Whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe ''&quot;any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zhistorintpolency.html History of International Police Cooperation], from the final protocols of the &quot;International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also been taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.\n\nThe word '''anarchism''' is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;|&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;]]'' (&quot;without [[archon]]s (ruler, chief, king)&quot;). Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]], is the belief that ''rulers'' are unnecessary and should be abolished, although there are differing interpretations of what this means. Anarchism also refers to related [[social movement]]s) that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions, particularly the [[state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Definitions_of_anarchism Definitions of anarchism] on Wikiquote, accessed 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[anarchy]],&quot; as most anarchists use it, does not imply [[chaos]], [[nihilism]], or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious [[anti-authoritarian]] society. In place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions, anarchists advocate social relations based upon [[voluntary association]] of autonomous individuals, [[mutual aid]], and [[self-governance]]. \n    \nWhile anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics; there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about. \n\n== Origins and predecessors ==\n\n[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], and others, argue that before recorded [[history]], human society was organized on anarchist principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter. ''&quot;[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]&quot;'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthropologists follow Kropotkin and Engels in believing that hunter-gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour, accumulated wealth, or decreed law, and had equal access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Freidrich. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]&quot;'', 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|William Godwin]]\n\nAnarchists including the [[The Anarchy Organisation]] and [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] find anarchist attitudes in [[Taoism]] from [[History of China|Ancient China]].&lt;ref&gt;The Anarchy Organization (Toronto).

According to Kropotkin, Zeno &quot;repudiated the omnipotence of the state, its intervention and regimentation, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html Anarchism], written by Peter Kropotkin, from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe [[Anabaptist]]s of 16th century Europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism. [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''History of Western Philosophy'', writes that the Anabaptists &quot;repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by [[the Holy Spirit]]...[f]rom this premise they arrive at [[communism]]....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], Bertrand. ''&quot;Ancient philosophy&quot;'' in ''A History of Western Philosophy, and its connection with political and social circumstances from the earliest times to the present day'', 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diggers (True Levellers)|The Diggers]] or &quot;True Levellers&quot; were an early communistic movement during the time of the [[English Civil War]], and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zpub.com/notes/aan-hist.html An Anarchist Timeline], from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the [[modern era]], the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan]] in his ''Nouveaux voyages dans l'Am\u00e9rique septentrionale'', (1703), where he described the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous American]] society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-12 Dictionary of the History of Ideas - ANARCHISM]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Russell Means]], a [[libertarian]] and leader in the [[American Indian Movement]], has repeatedly stated that he is &quot;an anarchist, and so are all [his] ancestors.&quot;\n\nIn 1793, in the thick of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] published ''An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html]. Although Godwin did not use the word ''anarchism'', many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism.&quot; But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term ''anarchiste'' was known mainly as an insult hurled by the [[bourgeois]] [[Girondins]] at more radical elements in the [[French revolution]].\n\n==The first self-labelled anarchist==\n[[Image:Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.jpg|110px|thumb|left|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]\n{{main articles|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]}}\n\nIt is commonly held that it wasn't until [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propri\u00e9t\u00e9), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called 'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources, capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice. \n\nProudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]] (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.\n\nProudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|here]].''\n\n==Max Stirner's Egoism==\n{{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}\n\nIn his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;\n\nStirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.\n\n==American individualist anarchism==\n[[Image:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]\n{{main articles|[[Individualist anarchism]] and [[American individualist anarchism]]}}\n\nIn 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]] experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)\n\n[[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty'' from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]]; Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]] (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]]; and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]], Benjamin. ''&quot;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/tucker/tucker37.htm Labor and Its Pay]&quot;'' Individual Liberty: Selections From the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker, Vanguard Press, New York, 1926, Kraus Reprint Co., Millwood, NY, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;[[market economy]] for trading this property. He argued that in a truly free market system without the state, the abundance of  competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor. \n\nOther 19th century individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], and [[Victor Yarros]].\n\n==The First International==\n[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin 1814-1876]]]]\n{{main articles|[[International Workingmen's Association]], [[Anarchism and Marxism]]}}\n\nIn Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes called the 'First International', united some diverse European revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to active workers movements the International became signficiant. \n\nFrom the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International: he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.   The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity.\n\nBakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], Mikhail. ''&quot;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/adpage.php?id=1969 Statism and Anarchy]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]]. This is often cited as the origin of the [[Anarchist_objections_to_marxism|conflict between anarchists and Marxists]]. From this moment the ''[[Social democracy|social democratic]]'' and ''[[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]]'' currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival [[List of left-wing internationals|'internationals'.]]\n\n==Anarchist Communism==\n{{main|Anarchist communism}}\n[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]\n\nProudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]\n\nAn early anarchist communist was Joseph D\u00e9jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle - Lettre \u00e0 P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D\u00e9jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).\n\nPeter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.\n\nSome anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Propaganda of the deed==\n[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]\n{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}\n\nAnarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. \n\nOne of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  \n\nHowever, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).\n\nOther anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].\n\n==Anarchism in the labour movement==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]\n\n[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.\n\nAfter the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.\n\n[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]\n\nSpanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].\n\nSyndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].\n\nContemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  \n\nThe largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.\n\n==The Russian Revolution==\n{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. \n\nThe ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.\n\n==The fight against fascism==\n{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}\n[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:\n\n:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}\n\nIn France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. \n\nIn reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''\n\n==Religious anarchism==\n[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]\n{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}\n\nMost anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.\n\n[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.\n\nChristian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.\n\n[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].\n\n[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].\n\n==Anarchism and feminism==\n[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]\n{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}\n\nEarly [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'H\u00e9ricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.\n \nAnarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}\n\nAnarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  \n\nAnarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.\n\nIn the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Anarcho-capitalism==\n[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]\n{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}\nAnarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.\n\n[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M.

For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.\n\n==Anarchism and the environment==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}\n\nPrimitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.\n\n==Other branches and offshoots==\nAnarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.\n\n[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]\n*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]\n\n*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]\n\n*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]\n\n*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]\n\n==Other issues==\n*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]\n\n*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.\n\n*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.\n\n*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.\n\n*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism.

[[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.\n\n*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).\n\n*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''\n\n==Criticisms of anarchism==\n:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]\n\n'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:\n:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; \n\n'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.\n\n'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Cultural phenomena==\n[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928\u2013)]]\nThe kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently \u00e9litist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:\n\n* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]\n* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]\n* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] \n* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]\n* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicol\u00e1s Rossell\u00f3]]\n\nIn [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   \n\nIn various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.\n''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]]''\n\n==See also==\n&lt;!-- (Please take care in adding to this list that it not grow excessively large, consider adding to the list of anarchist concepts page) --&gt;\nThere are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism, this is a brief summary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Atheism}}
'''Atheism''' is, in a broad sense, the absence of belief in the existence of [[God]]s. In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no gods.

The term ''atheism'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#940;&amp;#952;&amp;#949;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;|&amp;#940;&amp;#952;&amp;#949;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;]]'' (''atheos''), meaning &quot;without god(s)&quot;, used as a pejorative term to refer to those who denied the gods worshipped by the larger society. With the spread of [[free thought]], [[skepticism]], and scientific criticism of [[religion]], the term began to acquire a more positive meaning and was first used to describe a self-avowed position in the 18th century.

==Scope and definitions==
[[Image:Bertrand Russell.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Bertrand Russell]] (1872-1970)]]
The definition of atheism has varied over time and is still a subject of some disagreement. In the past, atheism was often defined as a positive assertion of disbelief in God or gods. However, with the rise of [[analytic philosophy]] and the increasing recognition of the importance of [[burden of proof]], many contemporary atheists prefer to define atheism as simply the absence of belief in God or gods. This definition places the burden of proof on those who assert the existence of God or gods.

Some definitions of atheism also include a rejection of [[supernatural]] beliefs in general, not just the belief in gods. Others argue that atheism is strictly about the existence of gods, and that other supernatural beliefs (such as [[ghost]]s or [[astrology]]) are separate issues.

==Arguments for atheism==
Arguments for atheism can be broadly categorized into philosophical, scientific, and historical arguments.

===Philosophical arguments===
*'''The problem of evil:''' This argument states that the existence of evil and suffering in the world is incompatible with the existence of an [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], and [[omnibenevolent]] God. If such a God existed, he would be able to prevent evil, know about evil, and want to prevent evil. Since evil exists, such a God cannot exist.
*'''The problem of divine hiddenness:''' This argument states that if God exists and desires a relationship with humanity, he would make his existence more obvious. The fact that many sincere seekers do not find evidence of God's existence suggests that God does not exist.
*'''Incoherence of the concept of God:''' Some philosophers argue that the concept of God, particularly the traditional Abrahamic God with properties like omnipotence and omniscience, is inherently contradictory or incoherent. For example, can an omnipotent God create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it?
*'''Lack of evidence:''' Many atheists argue that there is simply no compelling evidence for the existence of God or gods. They contend that belief in God is based on faith, tradition, or personal experience, none of which constitute objective evidence.

===Scientific arguments===
*'''Evolution:''' The theory of [[evolution by natural selection]] provides a comprehensive explanation for the diversity of life on Earth without the need for a divine creator.
*'''Cosmology:''' Modern [[cosmology]] offers explanations for the origin and development of the universe that do not require a supernatural intervention.
*'''Neuroscience:''' Advances in [[neuroscience]] suggest that religious experiences and beliefs can be explained by brain activity, rather than by external divine influence.

===Historical arguments===
*'''Mythology and cultural relativism:''' The existence of numerous diverse [[mythology|mythologies]] and religious beliefs across different cultures and historical periods suggests that religions are human constructs, rather than divinely revealed truths.
*'''Historical criticism of religious texts:''' Critical analysis of religious texts often reveals inconsistencies, historical inaccuracies, and evidence of human authorship, undermining claims of divine inspiration.

==Types of atheism==
Atheism can be further categorized based on the strength of the claim or the reasoning behind it.

*'''Strong atheism (positive atheism):''' The explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. This is a positive claim about the non-existence of gods.
*'''Weak atheism (negative atheism):''' The absence of belief in gods, without explicitly asserting their non-existence. This is a lack of belief, rather than a belief in non-existence.
*'''Implicit atheism:''' The absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it. This applies to infants, or individuals who have never encountered the concept of God.
*'''Explicit atheism:''' The conscious rejection of belief in God or gods.

==Atheism and related concepts==
*'''Agnosticism:''' The view that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable. Agnosticism is not a belief system in itself, but rather a stance on knowledge. An individual can be an agnostic atheist (does not believe in God, but does not claim to know for sure that God does not exist) or an agnostic theist (believes in God, but does not claim to know for sure that God exists).
*'''Antitheism:''' Active opposition to theism. Antitheists may argue that belief in God is harmful to individuals and society.
*'''Secularism:''' The principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institutions and religious dignitaries. Secularism does not necessarily imply atheism, but many atheists support secularism.
*'''Humanism:''' A philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, generally preferring critical thinking and evidence over established doctrine or faith. Many atheists are humanists.

==Demographics==
It is difficult to accurately measure the number of atheists worldwide, as definitions vary and many individuals may not openly identify as atheist due to social or political pressures. However, surveys and studies suggest that atheism is more prevalent in certain regions, such as [[Scandinavia]], [[East Asia]], and parts of [[Europe]].

==Notable atheists==
Throughout history, many prominent figures have been identified as atheists or have expressed views consistent with atheism. These include philosophers, scientists, writers, and activists.

* [[Epicurus]]
* [[Baruch Spinoza]]
* [[David Hume]]
* [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]
* [[Karl Marx]]
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
* [[Bertrand Russell]]
* [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]
* [[Richard Dawkins]]
* [[Christopher Hitchens]]

The '''aardvark''' (''Orycteropus afer'') is a medium-sized, [[burrow]]ing, [[nocturnal]] [[mammal]] native to [[Africa]]. It is the only surviving species of its order, [[Tubulidentata]]. The name ''aardvark'' means &quot;earth pig&quot; in [[Afrikaans]] and earlier [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

The aardvark is the only surviving species of the order Tubulidentata, though other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. The aardvarks are considered to be [[ungulate]]s. The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the [[elephant shrew]]s, [[tenrec]]s and [[golden mole]]s. The earliest known fossil remains of ''Orycteropus'' were found in [[Kenya]] and are 5 million years old, meaning that the animal has changed very little since the [[Pliocene]].

==Characteristics==
The aardvark is a stout, medium-sized animal with a strong body and a pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It has a long, sticky tongue and powerful claws, which allow it to dig into [[termite]] and [[ant]] mounds. The aardvark is the only mammal that has teeth that lack enamel and have no pulp cavity; they are composed of some 1500 hexagonal prisms of modified [[dentine]], with vertical parallel pulp canals. The teeth are continuously growing and are worn away by the animal's diet. The aardvark has a keen sense of smell, but its eyesight is poor. It is a nocturnal animal, and it is very shy.

The aardvark is typically 1 to 1.3 meters (3.3 to 4.3 ft) long, with a tail of about 70 cm (28 in), and weighs between 60 and 80 kg (130 and 180 lb). It is a pale yellowish-gray, often stained by soil. Its coat is thin, and its skin is tough, which helps protect it from insect bites.

==Behavior==
Aardvarks are solitary animals. They emerge from their burrows at night to feed. They are primarily [[insectivore]]s, feeding on ants and termites. They use their powerful claws to dig into mounds, and their long, sticky tongues to lap up the insects. Aardvarks are also known to eat other insects, such as [[locust]]s, and occasionally [[fruit]].

Aardvarks are excellent diggers, and they create extensive burrow systems. These burrows provide shelter from predators and the elements. They are also used as nurseries for their young. Aardvarks typically have one offspring per year, after a gestation period of about seven months. The young are born in the burrow and remain there for several weeks.

==Conservation status==
The aardvark is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Although its population is stable, it faces threats from [[habitat loss]] and [[hunting]].

==Cultural references==
The aardvark is a well-known animal in Africa, and it is often featured in [[folklore]] and [[children's literature]]. It is also the subject of the popular [[cartoon]] character [[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur Read]].

'''Anarchism''' originated as a term of abuse first used against early [[working class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English Revolution]] and the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French Revolution]].[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html] Whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe ''&quot;any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zhistorintpolency.html History of International Police Cooperation], from the final protocols of the &quot;International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also been taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.

The word '''anarchism''' is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;|&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;]]'' (&quot;without [[archon]]s (ruler, chief, king)&quot;). Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]], is the belief that ''rulers'' are unnecessary and should be abolished, although there are differing interpretations of what this means. Anarchism also refers to related [[social movement]]s) that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions, particularly the [[state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Definitions_of_anarchism Definitions of anarchism] on Wikiquote, accessed 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[anarchy]],&quot; as most anarchists use it, does not imply [[chaos]], [[nihilism]], or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious [[anti-authoritarian]] society. In place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions, anarchists advocate social relations based upon [[voluntary association]] of autonomous individuals, [[mutual aid]], and [[self-governance]]. 
    
While anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics; there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about. 

== Origins and predecessors ==

[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], and others, argue that before recorded [[history]], human society was organized on anarchist principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter. ''&quot;[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]&quot;'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthropologists follow Kropotkin and Engels in believing that hunter-gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour, accumulated wealth, or decreed law, and had equal access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Freidrich. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]&quot;'', 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchists including the [[The Anarchy Organisation]] and [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] find anarchist attitudes in [[Taoism]] from [[History of China|Ancient China]].&lt;ref&gt;The Anarchy Organization (Toronto). ''Taoism and Anarchy.'' [[April 14]] [[2002]] [http://www.toxicpop.co.uk/library/taoism.htm Toxicpop mirror] [http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/5705/taoan.html Vanity site mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], Murray. ''&quot;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ancient-chinese.html The Ancient Chinese Libertarian Tradition]&quot;'', an extract from ''&quot;[http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf Concepts of the Role of Intellectuals in Social Change Toward Laissez Faire]&quot;'', The Journal of Libertarian Studies, 9 (2) Fall 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] found similar ideas in [[stoicism|stoic]] [[Zeno of Citium]]. According to Kropotkin, Zeno &quot;repudiated the omnipotence of the state, its intervention and regimentation, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html Anarchism], written by Peter Kropotkin, from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anabaptist]]s of 16th century Europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism. [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''History of Western Philosophy'', writes that the Anabaptists &quot;repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by [[the Holy Spirit]]...[f]rom this premise they arrive at [[communism]]....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], Bertrand. ''&quot;Ancient philosophy&quot;'' in ''A History of Western Philosophy, and its connection with political and social circumstances from the earliest times to the present day'', 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diggers (True Levellers)|The Diggers]] or &quot;True Levellers&quot; were an early communistic movement during the time of the [[English Civil War]], and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zpub.com/notes/aan-hist.html An Anarchist Timeline], from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern era]], the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan]] in his ''Nouveaux voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale'', (1703), where he described the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous American]] society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-12 Dictionary of the History of Ideas - ANARCHISM]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Russell Means]], a [[libertarian]] and leader in the [[American Indian Movement]], has repeatedly stated that he is &quot;an anarchist, and so are all [his] ancestors.&quot;

In 1793, in the thick of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] published ''An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html]. Although Godwin did not use the word ''anarchism'', many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism.&quot; But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term ''anarchiste'' was known mainly as an insult hurled by the [[bourgeois]] [[Girondins]] at more radical elements in the [[French revolution]].

==The first self-labelled anarchist==
[[Image:Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.jpg|110px|thumb|left|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]
{{main articles|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]}}

It is commonly held that it wasn't until [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propriété), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called 'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources, capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice. 

Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]] (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.

Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|here]].''

==Max Stirner's Egoism==
{{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}

In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;

Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.

==American individualist anarchism==
[[Image:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]
{{main articles|[[Individualist anarchism]] and [[American individualist anarchism]]}}

In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]] experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)

[[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty'' from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]]; Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]] (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]]; and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]], Benjamin. ''&quot;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/tucker/tucker37.htm Labor and Its Pay]&quot;'' Individual Liberty: Selections From the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker, Vanguard Press, New York, 1926, Kraus Reprint Co., Millwood, NY, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;[[market economy]] for trading this property. He argued that in a truly free market system without the state, the abundance of  competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor. 

Other 19th century individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], and [[Victor Yarros]].

==The First International==
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin 1814-1876]]]]
{{main articles|[[International Workingmen's Association]], [[Anarchism and Marxism]]}}

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes called the 'First International', united some diverse European revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to active workers movements the International became signficiant. 

From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International: he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.   The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity.

Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], Mikhail. ''&quot;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/adpage.php?id=1969 Statism and Anarchy]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]]. This is often cited as the origin of the [[Anarchist_objections_to_marxism|conflict between anarchists and Marxists]]. From this moment the ''[[Social democracy|social democratic]]'' and ''[[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]]'' currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival [[List of left-wing internationals|'internationals'.]]

==Anarchist Communism==
{{main|Anarchist communism}}
[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

==The Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''

==Religious anarchism==
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]
{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}

Most anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.

Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.

[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].

[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

==Anarchism and feminism==
[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}

Early [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'Héricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.
 
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarcho-capitalism==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.

[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M. Ebeling, Editor), New York: The Center for Libertarian Studies, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;david-hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico]], Ralph [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of anarcho-capitalists dispute these claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain; Elkin, Gary; Neal, Dave ''et al'' [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append11.html Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; version 5.2] ''An Anarchist FAQ Version 11.2'' Accessed February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all, is highly controversial. For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.

==Anarchism and the environment==
{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}

Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}

Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

==Other branches and offshoots==
Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.

[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]
*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]

*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]

*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]

*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]

==Other issues==
*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]

*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.

*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.

*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.

*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.

*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).

*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''

==Criticisms of anarchism==
:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]

'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:
:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; 

'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.

'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:

* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] 
* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]
* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicolás Rosselló]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.

Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity. Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression."

I will find the index of the end of this prefix and then extract the next 100-200 words.
The prefix ends with: "The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression."
I will search for this exact string and then take the text that follows.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Anarchism}}
'''Anarchism''' originated as a term of abuse first used against early [[working class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English Revolution]] and the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French Revolution]].[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html] Whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe ''&quot;any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zhistorintpolency.html History of International Police Cooperation], from the final protocols of the &quot;International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also been taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.

The word '''anarchism''' is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;|&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;]]'' (&quot;without [[archon]]s (ruler, chief, king)&quot;). Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]], is the belief that ''rulers'' are unnecessary and should be abolished, although there are differing interpretations of what this means. Anarchism also refers to related [[social movement]]s) that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions, particularly the [[state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Definitions_of_anarchism Definitions of anarchism] on Wikiquote, accessed 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[anarchy]],&quot; as most anarchists use it, does not imply [[chaos]], [[nihilism]], or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious [[anti-authoritarian]] society. In place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions, anarchists advocate social relations based upon [[voluntary association]] of autonomous individuals, [[mutual aid]], and [[self-governance]]. 
    
While anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics; there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about. 

== Origins and predecessors ==

[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], and others, argue that before recorded [[history]], human society was organized on anarchist principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter. ''&quot;[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]&quot;'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthropologists follow Kropotkin and Engels in believing that hunter-gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour, accumulated wealth, or decreed law, and had equal access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Freidrich. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]&quot;'', 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|William Godwin]]

Anarchists including the [[The Anarchy Organisation]] and [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] find anarchist attitudes in [[Taoism]] from [[History of China|Ancient China]].&lt;ref&gt;The Anarchy Organization (Toronto). ''Taoism and Anarchy.'' [[April 14]] [[2002]] [http://www.toxicpop.co.uk/library/taoism.htm Toxicpop mirror] [http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/5705/taoan.html Vanity site mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], Murray. ''&quot;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ancient-chinese.html The Ancient Chinese Libertarian Tradition]&quot;'', an extract from ''&quot;[http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf Concepts of the Role of Intellectuals in Social Change Toward Laissez Faire]&quot;'', The Journal of Libertarian Studies, 9 (2) Fall 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] found similar ideas in [[stoicism|stoic]] [[Zeno of Citium]]. According to Kropotkin, Zeno &quot;repudiated the omnipotence of the state, its intervention and regimentation, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html Anarchism], written by Peter Kropotkin, from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anabaptist]]s of 16th century Europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism. [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''History of Western Philosophy'', writes that the Anabaptists &quot;repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by [[the Holy Spirit]]...[f]rom this premise they arrive at [[communism]]....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], Bertrand. ''&quot;Ancient philosophy&quot;'' in ''A History of Western Philosophy, and its connection with political and social circumstances from the earliest times to the present day'', 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diggers (True Levellers)|The Diggers]] or &quot;True Levellers&quot; were an early communistic movement during the time of the [[English Civil War]], and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zpub.com/notes/aan-hist.html An Anarchist Timeline], from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern era]], the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan]] in his ''Nouveaux voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale'', (1703), where he described the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous American]] society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-12 Dictionary of the History of Ideas - ANARCHISM]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Russell Means]], a [[libertarian]] and leader in the [[American Indian Movement]], has repeatedly stated that he is &quot;an anarchist, and so are all [his] ancestors.&quot;

In 1793, in the thick of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] published ''An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html]. Although Godwin did not use the word ''anarchism'', many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism.&quot; But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term ''anarchiste'' was known mainly as an insult hurled by the [[bourgeois]] [[Girondins]] at more radical elements in the [[French revolution]].

==The first self-labelled anarchist==
[[Image:Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.jpg|110px|thumb|left|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]
{{main articles|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]}}

It is commonly held that it wasn't until [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propriété), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called 'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources, capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice. 

Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]] (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.

Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|here]].''

==Max Stirner's Egoism==
{{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}

In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;

Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.

==American individualist anarchism==
[[Image:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]
{{main articles|[[Individualist anarchism]] and [[American individualist anarchism]]}}

In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]] experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)

[[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty'' from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]]; Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]] (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]]; and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]], Benjamin. ''&quot;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/tucker/tucker37.htm Labor and Its Pay]&quot;'' Individual Liberty: Selections From the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker, Vanguard Press, New York, 1926, Kraus Reprint Co., Millwood, NY, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;[[market economy]] for trading this property. He argued that in a truly free market system without the state, the abundance of  competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor. 

Other 19th century individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], and [[Victor Yarros]].

==The First International==
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin 1814-1876]]]]
{{main articles|[[International Workingmen's Association]], [[Anarchism and Marxism]]}}

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes called the 'First International', united some diverse European revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to active workers movements the International became signficiant. 

From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International: he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.   The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity.

Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], Mikhail. ''&quot;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/adpage.php?id=1969 Statism and Anarchy]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]]. This is often cited as the origin of the [[Anarchist_objections_to_marxism|conflict between anarchists and Marxists]]. From this moment the ''[[Social democracy|social democratic]]'' and ''[[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]]'' currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival [[List of left-wing internationals|'internationals'.]]

==Anarchist Communism==
{{main|Anarchist communism}}
[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism.

==Religious anarchism==
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]
{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}

Most anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.

Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.

[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].

[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

==Anarchism and feminism==
[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}

Early [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'Héricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.
 
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarcho-capitalism==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.

[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M. Ebeling, Editor), New York: The Center for Libertarian Studies, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;david-hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico]], Ralph [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of anarcho-capitalists dispute these claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain; Elkin, Gary; Neal, Dave ''et al'' [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append11.html Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; version 5.2] ''An Anarchist FAQ Version 11.2'' Accessed February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all, is highly controversial. For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.

==Anarchism and the environment==
{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}

Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}

Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

==Other branches and offshoots==
Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.

[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]
*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]

*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]

*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]

*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]

==Other issues==
*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]

*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.

*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.

*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.

*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.

*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).

*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''

==Criticisms of anarchism==
:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]

'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:
:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; 

'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.

'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:

* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] 
* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]
* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicolás Rosselló]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.

The instruction "Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text" is very strict. This means I should not include "''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]]''", "==See also==", the comment `<!-- ... -->`, or the bulleted lists.

The actual *plain text continuation* that follows the prefix, *excluding* meta-text, headings, and lists, would be:

"There are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism, this is a brief summary. There is also a more extensive list of anarchist concepts. The following is a sample of books that have been referenced in this page, a more complete list can be found at the list of anarchist books. These notes have no corresponding reference in the article. They might be re-used. The overwhelming diversity and number of links relating to anarchism is extensively covered on the links subpage. Blogs by Anarchists. extensively archives information relating to famous anarchists. This includes many of their books and other publications. Hundreds of anarchists are listed, with short bios, links & dedicated pages at the Daily Bleed's Anarchist Encyclopedia. wikipedia page. Industrial Workers of the World."

This interpretation removes all the Wikipedia-specific formatting and structure, which aligns with "plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis, no commentary). Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text."

Let's re-extract based on this strict interpretation.

The prefix ends with: "The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression."
I will find the index of the end of this string.
Then, I will find the next occurrence of actual descriptive text, skipping any meta-text, headings, or lists.

Looking at the text after the prefix:
1. `''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]]''` - This is meta-text/formatting. Skip.
2. `==See also==` - This is a heading. Skip.
3. `<!-- (Please take care in adding to this list that it not grow excessively large, consider adding to the list of anarchist concepts page) -->` - This is a comment/meta-text. Skip.
4. `There are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism, this is a brief summary. There is also a more extensive [[list of anarchist concepts]].` - This is descriptive text. Start here.

So the continuation should start with "There are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism..." and continue for 100-200 words, while still avoiding lists and headings.

Let's refine the extraction.

'''Anarchism''' originated as a term of abuse first used against early [[working class]] [[radical]]s including the [[Diggers]] of the [[English Revolution]] and the [[sans-culotte|''sans-culottes'']] of the [[French Revolution]].[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770/Anarchism.html] Whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe ''&quot;any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zhistorintpolency.html History of International Police Cooperation], from the final protocols of the &quot;International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists&quot;, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;, it has also been taken up as a positive label by self-defined anarchists.

The word '''anarchism''' is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;|&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;]]'' (&quot;without [[archon]]s (ruler, chief, king)&quot;). Anarchism as a [[political philosophy]], is the belief that ''rulers'' are unnecessary and should be abolished, although there are differing interpretations of what this means. Anarchism also refers to related [[social movement]]s) that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions, particularly the [[state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Definitions_of_anarchism Definitions of anarchism] on Wikiquote, accessed 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[anarchy]],&quot; as most anarchists use it, does not imply [[chaos]], [[nihilism]], or [[anomie]], but rather a harmonious [[anti-authoritarian]] society. In place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions, anarchists advocate social relations based upon [[voluntary association]] of autonomous individuals, [[mutual aid]], and [[self-governance]]. 
    
While anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against, anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society. However, ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics; there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about. 

== Origins and predecessors ==

[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], and others, argue that before recorded [[history]], human society was organized on anarchist principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter. ''&quot;[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]&quot;'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthropologists follow Kropotkin and Engels in believing that hunter-gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour, accumulated wealth, or decreed law, and had equal access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Freidrich. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]&quot;'', 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|William Godwin]]

Anarchists including the [[The Anarchy Organisation]] and [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] find anarchist attitudes in [[Taoism]] from [[History of China|Ancient China]].&lt;ref&gt;The Anarchy Organization (Toronto). ''Taoism and Anarchy.'' [[April 14]] [[2002]] [http://www.toxicpop.co.uk/library/taoism.htm Toxicpop mirror] [http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/5705/taoan.html Vanity site mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], Murray. ''&quot;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ancient-chinese.html The Ancient Chinese Libertarian Tradition]&quot;'', an extract from ''&quot;[http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf Concepts of the Role of Intellectuals in Social Change Toward Laissez Faire]&quot;'', The Journal of Libertarian Studies, 9 (2) Fall 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] found similar ideas in [[stoicism|stoic]] [[Zeno of Citium]]. According to Kropotkin, Zeno &quot;repudiated the omnipotence of the state, its intervention and regimentation, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/britt1910.html Anarchism], written by Peter Kropotkin, from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anabaptist]]s of 16th century Europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism. [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''History of Western Philosophy'', writes that the Anabaptists &quot;repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by [[the Holy Spirit]]...[f]rom this premise they arrive at [[communism]]....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], Bertrand. ''&quot;Ancient philosophy&quot;'' in ''A History of Western Philosophy, and its connection with political and social circumstances from the earliest times to the present day'', 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diggers (True Levellers)|The Diggers]] or &quot;True Levellers&quot; were an early communistic movement during the time of the [[English Civil War]], and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zpub.com/notes/aan-hist.html An Anarchist Timeline], from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern era]], the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan]] in his ''Nouveaux voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale'', (1703), where he described the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous American]] society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-12 Dictionary of the History of Ideas - ANARCHISM]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Russell Means]], a [[libertarian]] and leader in the [[American Indian Movement]], has repeatedly stated that he is &quot;an anarchist, and so are all [his] ancestors.&quot;

In 1793, in the thick of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] published ''An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pjtp.html]. Although Godwin did not use the word ''anarchism'', many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism.&quot; But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term ''anarchiste'' was known mainly as an insult hurled by the [[bourgeois]] [[Girondins]] at more radical elements in the [[French revolution]].

==The first self-labelled anarchist==
[[Image:Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.jpg|110px|thumb|left|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]
{{main articles|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]}}

It is commonly held that it wasn't until [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propriété), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called 'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources, capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice. 

Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]] (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.

Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|here]].''

==Max Stirner's Egoism==
{{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}

In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;

Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.

==American individualist anarchism==
[[Image:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]
{{main articles|[[Individualist anarchism]] and [[American individualist anarchism]]}}

In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]] experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)

[[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty'' from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]]; Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]] (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]]; and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]], Benjamin. ''&quot;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/tucker/tucker37.htm Labor and Its Pay]&quot;'' Individual Liberty: Selections From the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker, Vanguard Press, New York, 1926, Kraus Reprint Co., Millwood, NY, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;[[market economy]] for trading this property. He argued that in a truly free market system without the state, the abundance of  competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor. 

Other 19th century individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], and [[Victor Yarros]].

==The First International==
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin 1814-1876]]]]
{{main articles|[[International Workingmen's Association]], [[Anarchism and Marxism]]}}

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes called the 'First International', united some diverse European revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to active workers movements the International became signficiant. 

From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International: he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.   The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity.

Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], Mikhail. ''&quot;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/adpage.php?id=1969 Statism and Anarchy]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]]. This is often cited as the origin of the [[Anarchist_objections_to_marxism|conflict between anarchists and Marxists]]. From this moment the ''[[Social democracy|social democratic]]'' and ''[[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]]'' currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival [[List of left-wing internationals|'internationals'.]]

==Anarchist Communism==
{{main|Anarchist communism}}
[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

==The Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''

==Religious anarchism==
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]
{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}

Most anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.

Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.

[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].

[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

==Anarchism and feminism==
[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}

Early [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'Héricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.
 
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarcho-capitalism==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.

[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M. Ebeling, Editor), New York: The Center for Libertarian Studies, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;david-hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico]], Ralph [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of anarcho-capitalists dispute these claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain; Elkin, Gary; Neal, Dave ''et al'' [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append11.html Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; version 5.2] ''An Anarchist FAQ Version 11.2'' Accessed February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all, is highly controversial. For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.

==Anarchism and the environment==
{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}

Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}

Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

==Other branches and offshoots==
Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.

*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]

*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]

*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]

*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]

==Other issues==
*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]

*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.

*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.

*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.

*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.

*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).

*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''

==Criticisms of anarchism==
:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]

'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:
:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; 

'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.

'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:

* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] 
* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]
* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicolás Rosselló]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.
