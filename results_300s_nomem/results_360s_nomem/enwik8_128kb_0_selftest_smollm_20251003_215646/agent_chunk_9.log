│  In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years   │
│  later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes    │
│  called the 'First International', united some diverse European             │
│  revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to    │
│  active workers movements the International became signficiant.             │
│  From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International:    │
│  he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.     │
│  The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who    │
│  opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his  │
│  followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into    │
│  two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The      │
│  clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists    │
│  around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical     │
│  struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political          │
│  parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers        │
│  focused on parliamentary activity.                                         │

│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

│  [[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah  │
│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │
│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │
│  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas      │
│                                                                             │

│  1.  **Objective Reiteration:** My primary goal is to minimize future       │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context        │
│  through strategic tool usage and learned patterns, operating under the     │
│  Sink-Inclusive Description Length (SIMDL) framework.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Initial Task Requirement:** The prompt explicitly states, "Start by  │
│  analyzing the directory and then use the tools correctly to solve the      │
│  task." The specified directory is `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This     │
│  analysis is critical for identifying potential entropy sinks and           │
│  understanding the available external information sources.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Tool Analysis and Limitation Identification:**                       │
│      *   I have been provided with the following Python library:            │
│  `default_api`.                                                             │
│      *   Within `default_api`, the only available function is               │
│  `create_reasoning_plan(plan: str, ready: bool)`.                           │
│      *   This function is designed solely for creating or refining a        │
│  reasoning plan and indicating readiness. It does not provide any           │
│  capabilities for interacting with a file system, such as listing           │
│  directory contents, reading files, or searching for information within a   │
│  specified path.                                                            │
│      *   Therefore, I currently lack any tool that can perform the          │
│  required "analysis of the directory /C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink" or       │
│  access any "external information sources" (entropy sinks) that might       │
│  reside within it.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Impact on Operational Strategy:** My operational strategy is         │
│  fundamentally dependent on querying external knowledge sources. Without a  │
│  tool to access the specified directory, I cannot perform this crucial      │
│  initial step. Consequently, I am unable to:                                │
│      *   Infer domain, authorship, structural patterns, or likely source    │
│  material from the contents of the sink directory.                          │
│      *   Locate exact matching content or highly relevant contextual        │
│  material within the designated entropy sink.                               │
│      *   Extract verbatim continuations or synthesize high-confidence       │
│  predictions based on external data from the sink.                          │
│      *   Prioritize information-dense elements from external sources, as I  │
│  cannot access them.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Conclusion on Readiness:** Given the absence of any tool capable of  │
│  interacting with the file system to analyze the                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, I am unable to perform the       │
│  foundational step required to begin the task of minimizing future token    │
│  prediction entropy by leveraging external information sources. I cannot    │
│  proceed with the core operational strategy without the ability to access   │
│  the specified entropy sink.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` contains    │
│  three subdirectories: `cantrbry`, `enwik8_samples`, and `synthetic`. The   │
│  current text prefix is about anarchism, its history, and key figures like  │
│  Proudhon, Stirner, and American individualist anarchists. The previous     │
│  chunks also discussed these topics, including references to Wikipedia      │
│  articles and specific texts.                                               │
│  Given the nature of the text (historical and theoretical discussion of     │
│  anarchism, with many references), it is highly probable that the source    │
│  document is a Wikipedia article or a similar encyclopedic text. The        │
│  `enwik8_samples` directory contains files named `enwik8_128kb_0` through   │
│  `enwik8_128kb_23`. `enwik8` is a common dataset derived from Wikipedia     │
│  for compression research. It is very likely that the source document for   │
│  the current prefix is one of these `enwik8_128kb_` files.                  │
│  I need to search for the exact text of the prefix within these             │
│  `enwik8_128kb_` files to find the source and its continuation. I will      │
│  start by searching for a distinctive part of the prefix in the             │
│  `enwik8_samples` directory. A good query would be "Benjamin Tucker became  │
│  interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and William B.       │
│  Greene."                                                                   │

│  Thought: Thought: My initial search for the exact phrase "Benjamin Tucker  │
│  became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and William   │
│  B. Greene." within the `enwik8_samples` directory yielded no results.      │
│  This could mean a few things:                                              │
│  1. The exact phrase might not be present in the `enwik8_samples` files,    │
│  even if the content is there. There might be slight variations.            │
│  2. The source document might not be in the `enwik8_samples` directory, or  │
│  it might be in a different format or location within the allowed           │
│  directories.                                                               │
│  Given that `enwik8` is a Wikipedia dump, and the text has many             │
│  Wikipedia-style references (`<ref>...</ref>`, `[[...]]`), it's still       │
│  highly probable that the source is a Wikipedia article. The                │
│  `enwik8_samples` are likely chunks of a larger Wikipedia dump.             │
│  I need to broaden my search. Instead of a very long, exact phrase, I will  │
│  try a shorter, more distinctive phrase from the *end* of the prefix, as    │
│  that's where the continuation would immediately follow. A good candidate   │
│  is "Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the        │
│  ideas". This phrase is unique enough to likely pinpoint the exact          │
│  location.                                                                  │

│  In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years   │
│  later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes    │
│  called the 'First International', united some diverse European             │
│  revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to    │
│  active workers movements the International became signficiant.             │
│  From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International:    │
│  he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.     │
│  The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who    │
│  opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his  │
│  followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into    │
│  two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The      │
│  clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists    │
│  around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical     │
│  struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political          │
│  parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers        │
│  focused on parliamentary activity.                                         │
│  Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted     │
│  that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad    │
│  as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail       │

│  split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague          │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;  │
│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │
│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │

│  om d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan in his Nouveaux voyages dans      │
│  l'Amérique septentrionale, (1703), where he described the indigenous       │
│  American society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private   │
│  property, as being in anarchy. Russell Means, a libertarian and leader in  │
│  the American Indian Movement, has repeatedly stated that he is "an         │
│  anarchist, and so are all his ancestors."                                  │
│  In 1793, in the thick of the French Revolution, William Godwin published   │
│  An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice. Although Godwin did not use the   │
│  word anarchism, many later anarchists have regarded this book as the       │
│  first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the "founder of philosophical    │
│  anarchism." But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the   │
│  term anarchiste was known mainly as an insult hurled by the bourgeois      │
│  Girondins at more radical elements in the French revolution.               │

│  reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which       │
│  individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in   │
│  their self interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about         │
│  through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to   │
│  him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is    │

│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │
│  thought are diverse.                                                       │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property. Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist       │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │

│  [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godw  │

│  later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist      │
│  text, and Godwin as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism.&quot;    │
│  But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term          │
│  ''anarchiste'' was known mainly as an insult hurled by the [[bourgeois]]   │

│  published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term                  │
│  &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this    │
│  reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist         │
│  theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous          │
│  accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the  │
│  institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propriété), where owners      │
│  have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they   │
│  wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref                        │

│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│                                                                             │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

│  Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a        │
│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │
│  interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see   │

│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │

│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │
│  first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as               │
│  Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)                      │

│  [[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah  │
│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │
│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │

│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]\nAn early anarchist communist was Joseph D\u00e9jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle - Lettre \u00e0 P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D\u00e9jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).\nPeter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.\nSome anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref\n\n# chunk:6\nom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan in his Nouveaux voyages dans l'Am\u00e9rique septentrionale, (1703), where he described the indigenous American society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy. Russell Means, a libertarian and leader in the American Indian Movement, has repeatedly stated that he is \"an anarchist, and so are all his ancestors.\"\nIn 1793, in the thick of the French Revolution, William Godwin published An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice. Although Godwin did not use the word anarchism, many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the \"founder of philosophical anarchism.\" But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term anarchiste was known mainly as an insult hurled by the bourgeois Girondins at more radical elements in the French revolution.\n\n# chunk:8\nin the mind, saying of society that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;\nStirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'.

It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propri\u00e9t\u00e9), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph.

This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.\n\nProudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas.

This is often cited as the origin of the [[Anarchist_objections_to_marxism|conflict between anarchists and Marxists]].

==Anarchist Communism==

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]
An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).
Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.
Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref

om d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan in his Nouveaux voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale, (1703), where he described the indigenous American society, which had no state, laws, prisons, priests, or private property, as being in anarchy. Russell Means, a libertarian and leader in the American Indian Movement, has repeatedly stated that he is "an anarchist, and so are all his ancestors."
In 1793, in the thick of the French Revolution, William Godwin published An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice. Although Godwin did not use the word anarchism, many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text, and Godwin as the "founder of philosophical anarchism." But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term anarchiste was known mainly as an insult hurled by the bourgeois Girondins at more radical elements in the French revolution.

in the mind, saying of society that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;
Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.

==The first self-labelled anarchist==
[[Image:Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.jpg|110px|thumb|left|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]
{{main articles|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]}}

It is commonly held that it wasn't until [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] published ''[[What is Property?]]'' in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. In [[What is Property?]] Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (propriété), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish, such as exploiting workers for profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called 'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources, capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice. 

Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]] (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in France.

Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|here]].''

==Max Stirner's Egoism==
{{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}

In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists' only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;

Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label 'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse.

[[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah Warren and [[William B. Greene]].
