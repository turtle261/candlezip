│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │

│  or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing,   │
│  or pointing out objects of interest to other people). ##restricted         │
│  repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and            │
│  activities, as manifested by at least one of the following:                │
│  ###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted  │
│  patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus         │
│  ###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or  │
│  rituals ###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or      │
│  finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements)              │
│  ###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. B. Delays or abnormal   │
│  functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to    │
│  age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social        │
│  communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. C. The disturbance is  │
│  not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative    │
│  Disorder.                                                                  │

│  uage]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech,   │
│  autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need.    │
│  As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration    │
│  or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic       │
│  people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever   │
│  they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may            │
│  contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.      │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive   │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic     │
│  children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students     │
│  have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but     │
│  with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and  │
│  many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work      │
│  with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with    │
│  the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into  │
│  the mainstream environment of the classroom.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to    │
│  give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to       │
│  explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic   │
│  child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the     │
│  rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so  │
│  that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given    │
│  the extra help that they need.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their  │
│  students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to  │
│  know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going  │
│  to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of   │
│  them.                                                                      │

│  Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of      │
│  anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a  │
│  student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for     │
│  educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety.           │
│  Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower  │
│  anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching  │
│  approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive         │
│  Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control          │
│  excessive behavioral reactions.                                            │

│  1.  **Objective Reiteration:** My primary goal is to minimize future       │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context        │
│  through strategic tool usage and learned patterns, operating under the     │
│  Sink-Inclusive Description Length (SIMDL) framework.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Initial Task Requirement:** The prompt explicitly states, "Start by  │
│  analyzing the directory and then use the tools correctly to solve the      │
│  task." The specified directory is `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This     │
│  analysis is critical for identifying potential entropy sinks and           │
│  understanding the available external information sources.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Tool Analysis and Limitation Identification:**                       │
│      *   I have been provided with the following Python library:            │
│  `default_api`.                                                             │
│      *   Within `default_api`, the only available function is               │
│  `create_reasoning_plan(plan: str, ready: bool)`.                           │
│      *   This function is designed solely for creating or refining a        │
│  reasoning plan and indicating readiness. It does not provide any           │
│  capabilities for interacting with a file system, such as listing           │
│  directory contents, reading files, or searching for information within a   │
│  specified path.                                                            │
│      *   Therefore, I currently lack any tool that can perform the          │
│  required "analysis of the directory /C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink" or       │
│  access any "external information sources" (entropy sinks) that might       │
│  reside within it.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Impact on Operational Strategy:** My operational strategy is         │
│  fundamentally dependent on querying external knowledge sources. Without a  │
│  tool to access the specified directory, I cannot perform this crucial      │
│  initial step. Consequently, I am unable to:                                │
│      *   Infer domain, authorship, structural patterns, or likely source    │
│  material from the contents of the sink directory.                          │
│      *   Locate exact matching content or highly relevant contextual        │
│  material within the designated entropy sink.                               │
│      *   Extract verbatim continuations or synthesize high-confidence       │
│  predictions based on external data from the sink.                          │
│      *   Prioritize information-dense elements from external sources, as I  │
│  cannot access them.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Conclusion on Readiness:** Given the absence of any tool capable of  │
│  interacting with the file system to analyze the                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, I am unable to perform the       │
│  foundational step required to begin the task of minimizing future token    │
│  prediction entropy by leveraging external information sources. I cannot    │
│  proceed with the core operational strategy without the ability to access   │
│  the specified entropy sink.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

  - Calling tool search_files_content with arguments: {"is_regex":false,"path":"/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/enwik8_samples","pattern":"enwik8_128kb_*","query":"uage]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.\n\n===Repetitive behaviors===\nAlthough people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or \u0026quot;stimming,\u0026quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine\u0026amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route\u0026amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.\n\n===Effects in education===\nChildren with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. \n\nSome students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. \n\nResearch has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. \u0026lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --\u0026gt; Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.\n\nA teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. \n\nThere are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.\n\nStudents with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.\n\n== DSM definition ==\nAutism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:\n#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): \n##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: \n###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction \n###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level \n###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) \n###lack of social or emotional reciprocity \n##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: \n###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) \n###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others \n###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language \n###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level\n##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: \n###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus \n###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals \n###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) \n###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects\n#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. \n#The disturbance is not better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].\n\nThe ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''\u0026lt;!-- --\u0026gt;'s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective.

│                                                                             │
│  Thought: Thought: The directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` contains    │
│  three subdirectories: `cantrbry`, `enwik8_samples`, and `synthetic`. The   │
│  current document prefix is about "Autism Spectrum Disorders" and "DSM      │
│  definition". This suggests that the source document is likely a Wikipedia  │
│  article or a similar encyclopedic text. The `enwik8_samples` directory,    │
│  containing files like `enwik8_128kb_0`, `enwik8_128kb_1`, etc., strongly   │
│  suggests that these are chunks of the `enwik8` dataset, which is a common  │
│  benchmark for compression and language modeling, derived from Wikipedia.   │
│  Therefore, the most promising strategy is to search for the given prefix   │
│  within the `enwik8_samples` directory. I will use `search_files_content`   │
│  to find the exact prefix. Since the prefix contains special characters     │
│  like `&quot;` and `&amp;mdash;`, I will use the exact string as the query  │
│  and set `is_regex` to `false`. I will search within the                    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/enwik8_samples` directory and use a pattern  │
│  like `enwik8_128kb_*` to search all relevant files.                        │
│  The prefix is:                                                             │
│  "uage]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech,  │
│  autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need.    │
│  As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration    │
│  or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic       │
│  people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever   │
│  they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may            │
│  contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.      │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive    │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │
│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │
│  Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic     │
│  children. <!-- cite a source here, please! --> Autistic students have      │
│  problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with     │
│  socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many  │
│  feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with      │
│  peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the     │
│  problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the  │
│  mainstream environment of the classroom.                                   │
│  A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to    │
│  give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to       │
│  explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic   │
│  child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the     │
│  rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so  │
│  that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given    │
│  the extra help that they need.                                             │
│  There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their  │
│  students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to  │
│  know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going  │
│  to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of   │
│  them.                                                                      │
│  Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of      │
│  anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a  │

│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │

│  ###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or  │

│  ###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. B. Delays or abnormal   │

│  age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social        │
│  communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. C. The disturbance is  │
│  not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative    │
│  Disorder.                                                                  │

│  uage]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech,   │
│  autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need.    │
│  As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration    │
│  or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic       │
│  people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever   │
│  they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may            │
│  contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.      │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive   │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │
│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │
│  Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic     │
│  children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students     │
│  have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but     │
│  with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and  │
│  many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work      │
│  with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with    │
│  the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into  │
│  the mainstream environment of the classroom.                               │
│  A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to    │
│  give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to       │
│  explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic   │
│  child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the     │
│  rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so  │
│  that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given    │
│  the extra help that they need.                                             │
│  There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their  │
│  students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to  │
│  know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going  │
│  to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of   │
│  them.                                                                      │
│  Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of      │
│  anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a  │
│  student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for     │
│  educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety.           │
│  Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower  │
│  anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching  │
│  approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive         │
│  Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control          │
│  excessive behavioral reactions.                                            │

│  Autism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical    │

│  ##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least  │
│  two of the following:                                                      │
│  ###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as    │

│  ###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or         │
│  achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or   │
│  pointing out objects of interest)                                          │

│  ###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not     │
│  accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of       │
│  communication such as gesture or mime)                                     │
│  ###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability   │
│  to initiate or sustain a conversation with others                          │
│  ###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language    │
│  ###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play  │
│  appropriate to developmental level                                         │

│  The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s diagnostic       │
│  criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective.       │
│  (See the [[DSM cautionary statement]].) The criteria for autism is much    │
│  more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely,     │
│  instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.     │

│  Autism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly                │
│  [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally       │
│  handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to       │
│  appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms  │
│  of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often         │
│  divided into those with an [[Int                                           │
│  Thought: My previous attempt to find the exact prefix using                │
│  `search_files_content` failed. This could be due to a few reasons:         │
│  1.  The prefix might be split across two `enwik8_128kb_` files.            │
│  2.  There might be subtle differences in whitespace or character encoding  │
│  that prevent an exact match.                                               │
│  3.  The `enwik8_samples` files might not contain the exact version of the  │
│  Wikipedia article I'm looking for.                                         │
│  Given the nature of the `enwik8` dataset (Wikipedia dumps), it's highly    │
│  probable that the content is there, but perhaps the exact string match is  │
│  too strict.                                                                │
│  I will try a different approach. I will read the content of the            │
│  `enwik8_128kb_` files one by one and then search for the prefix within     │
│  the read content. This will allow me to handle cases where the prefix      │
│  might be at the very end of one chunk and the continuation at the          │
│  beginning of the next, or if there are minor formatting differences that   │
│  `search_files_content` might be sensitive to.                              │
│  First, I need to get a list of all `enwik8_128kb_` files.                  │

│  Thought: Thought: I have the list of files in `enwik8_samples`. I will     │
│  now read each file and search for the prefix within its content. If the    │
│  prefix is found, I will extract the continuation. Since the prefix is      │
│  quite long, it's possible it spans across two files. I will read the       │
│  files in order and keep track of the end of the previous file to check     │
│  for a split prefix.                                                        │
│  Let's start by reading `enwik8_128kb_0` and then iterate through the       │
│  rest. I will store the content of each file and then search for the        │
│  prefix. If not found, I will append the current file's content to the      │
│  previous one (or a buffer) and search again, to catch prefixes that span   │
│  file boundaries.                                                           │
│  Given the length of the prefix, it's unlikely to be at the very beginning  │
│  or end of a 128KB chunk. However, to be safe, I will read the files and    │
│  search.                                                                    │
│  I will read the files one by one and search for the prefix. If found, I    │
│  will extract the continuation. If not found in a single file, I will       │
│  consider concatenating the end of one file with the beginning of the next  │
│  to catch split prefixes.                                                   │
│  Let's start with `enwik8_128kb_0`.                                         │

│  '''Agnosticism''' is the philosophical view that the truth value of        │
│  certain claims&amp;mdash;especially claims about the existence or          │
│  non-existence of any [[deity]], but also other religious and metaphysical  │
│  claims&amp;mdash;is unknown or unknowable.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the word &quot;agnostic&quot; in 1869, and  │
│  said &quot;It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the          │
│  'gnostic' of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very  │
│  things of which I was ignorant.&quot;                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Types of agnosticism==                                                   │
│  Philosopher [[William L. Rowe]] defines agnosticism as the view that       │
│  human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to      │
│  justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not  │
│  exist.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Strong agnosticism''' (also called &quot;hard&quot; agnosticism,       │
│  &quot;closed&quot; agnosticism, or &quot;absolute&quot; agnosticism) is    │
│  the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of God and    │
│  the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural      │
│  inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective    │

│  god exists or not, and neither can you.&quot;                              │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Weak agnosticism''' (also called &quot;soft&quot; agnosticism,         │
│  &quot;open&quot; agnosticism, or &quot;empirical&quot; agnosticism) is     │
│  the view that the existence or non-existence of God is currently unknown   │
│  but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, further investigation is     │
│  possible. A weak agnostic would say, &quot;I don't know whether any gods   │
│  exist or not, but maybe one day, if there is more evidence, I could find   │
│  out.&quot;                                                                 │

│  *'''Apathetic agnosticism''' is the view that no amount of debate can      │
│  prove or disprove the existence of a deity, and since any deity that may   │
│  exist appears unconcerned with the universe or the welfare of its          │
│  inhabitants, the question is largely academic.                             │

│  *'''Agnostic theism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of    │

│  Agnosticism is sometimes confused with [[atheism]]. However, agnosticism   │
│  is not a belief system, but rather a statement about what can be known.    │
│  Atheism is the absence of belief in a god or gods. An agnostic may be an   │
│  atheist or a theist.                                                       │

│  ==Criticisms of agnosticism==                                              │
│  Some [[theist]]s see agnosticism as a way to avoid the question of         │
│  whether God exists. Some [[atheist]]s see agnosticism as a way to avoid    │
│  admitting that one is an atheist.                                          │

│  Thought: I have read the content of `enwik8_128kb_0`. I can see that it    │
│  contains XML-like Wikipedia dump format, with `<page>` tags and `<text     │
│  xml:space="preserve">` sections. The prefix I'm looking for is within the  │
│  `<text>` tag of the "Autism" page.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  I need to parse this XML-like structure to extract the relevant text       │
│  content. I will look for the `<page>` with `<title>Autism</title>` and     │
│  then extract the content of its `<text>` tag.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  After extracting the text, I will search for the prefix within it and      │
│  then extract the continuation.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Let's define the prefix again for clarity:                                 │
│  `prefix = "uage]], and since autistic natural language may not tend        │
│  towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know    │
│  what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream   │
│  in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for     │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or             │
│  depressed.\n\n===Repetitive behaviors===\nAlthough people with autism      │

│  repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot;     │
│  may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent   │
│  or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time    │
│  repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly     │
│  freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up      │
│  their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play.   │
│  If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be          │
│  tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute     │
│  consistency in their environment. A slight change in any                   │
│  routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to       │
│  school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely  │
│  disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense        │
│  preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all  │
│  about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often   │
│  they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or       │
│  [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken  │
│  word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a         │
│  specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily       │
│  routine.\n\n===Effects in education===\nChildren with autism are affected  │
│  with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them      │
│  apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble          │
│  understanding people’s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble            │
│  understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not          │
│  understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and  │
│  may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This         │
│  inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education          │
│  stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they  │
│  are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being         │
│  taught. \n\nSome students learn better with visual aids as they are        │
│  better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this,    │
│  many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This  │
│  allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they    │
│  know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some   │
│  autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so     │
│  this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. \n\nResearch has shown     │
│  that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!--      │
│  cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in      │
│  schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization   │
│  as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that      │
│  they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they     │
│  can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that  │
│  arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream     │
│  environment of the classroom.\n\nA teacher's aide can also be useful to    │
│  the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the   │
│  teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can   │
│  also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay  │
│  at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially       │
│  one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a   │
│  normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. \n\nThere     │
│  are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their        │
│  students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to  │
│  know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going  │
│  to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of   │
│  them.\n\nStudents with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high       │
│  levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like     │
│  school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is      │
│  important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and      │
│  anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories   │
│  can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using            │
│  systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or     │
│  other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to  │
│  control excessive behavioral reactions.\n\n== DSM definition ==\nAutism    │
│  is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual    │
│  of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:\n#A total of six (or more) items from   │
│  (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and    │
│  (3): \n##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by    │
│  at least two of the following: \n###marked impairment in the use of        │
│  multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression,   │
│  body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction \n###failure    │
│  to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level \n###a    │
│  lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or              │
│  achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or   │
│  pointing out objects of interest) \n###lack of social or emotional         │
│  reciprocity \n##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by  │
│  at least one of the following: \n###delay in, or total lack of, the        │
│  development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to           │
│  compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or   │
│  mime) \n###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the   │
│  ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others                  │
│  \n###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language  │
│  \n###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative     │
│  play appropriate to developmental level\n##restricted repetitive and       │
│  stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as            │
│  manifested by at least one of the following: \n###encompassing             │
│  preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of      │
│  interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus \n###apparently     │
│  inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals        │
│  \n###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger     │
│  flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) \n###persistent     │
│  preoccupation with parts of objects\n#Delays or abnormal functioning in    │
│  at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1)  │
│  social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3)   │
│  symbolic or imaginative play. \n#The disturbance is not better accounted   │
│  for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative     │
│  disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].\n\nThe ''Diagnostic and      │
│  Statistical Manual''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s diagnostic criteria in general is     │
│  controversial for being vague and subjective. (See the [[DSM cautionary    │
│  statement]].) The criteria for autism is much more controversial and some  │
│  clinicians today may ignore it completely, instead solely relying on       │
│  other methods for determining the diagnosis.\n\n== Types of autism ==      │
│  \nAutism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly              │
│  [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally       │
│  handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to       │
│  appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms  │
│  of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often         │
│  divided into those with an [[Int"`                                         │

│  '''Autism''' is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that           │
│  manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication    │
│  ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior.                  │

│  Although the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers  │
│  suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to   │
│  environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the          │
│  magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors,          │
│  researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among          │
│  individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as  │
│  many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National         │
│  Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in  │
│  1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic   │
│  child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in        │
│  twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]]        │
│  criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.    │
│                                                                             │
│  Autism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete       │
│  physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of         │
│  diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single          │
│  condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in      │
│  similar ways.                                                              │

│  By definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction,    │
│  language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative       │
│  play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the  │
│  [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]]  │
│  also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three        │
│  years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism      │
│  epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by    │
│  [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the            │

│  Some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to   │

│  social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure      │
│  from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic  │

│  The word ''autism'' was first used in the [[English language]] by Swiss    │
│  psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 number of the ''American         │

│  However, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not   │
│  occur until the middle of the [[twentieth century]], when in 1943          │
│  psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in       │
│  Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral           │
│  similarities, and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''. He      │
│  suggested &quot;autism&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]]             │
│  &amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''autos''),    │
│  meaning &quot;self&quot;, to describe the  fact that the children seemed   │
│  to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the     │
│  subject was published in a (now defunct) journal, ''The Nervous Child'',   │
│  almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as   │
│  typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.                             │
│                                                                             │
│  At the same time an [[Austria|Austrian]] scientist, Dr. [[Hans             │
│  Asperger]], described a different form of autism that became known as      │
│  [[Asperger's syndrome]]&amp;mdash;but the widespread recognition of        │
│  Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by     │
│  the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost  │
│  50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.          │

│  often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum             │

│  they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a         │
│  finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer         │
│  objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to        │
│  engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the     │
│  first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because    │
│  they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as           │
│  non-autistic children.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of  │
│  others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without   │
│  reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek     │
│  comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or        │
│  [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although       │
│  autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of   │
│  this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked  │
│  forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their      │
│  child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment               │
│  theory|attachment]] behavior.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Children with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of       │
│  mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's              │
│  perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age   │
│  of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult             │
│  [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical   │
│  5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge,  │
│  feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g.,    │
│  gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack     │
│  these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to       │
│  predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]]    │
│  of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many   │
│  of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an    │
│  imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in    │
│  non-autistic children.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate   │
│  their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that  │
│  may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism       │
│  generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react      │
│  negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals    │
│  to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior,      │
│  self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.            │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Sensory system===                                                       │
│  A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would  │
│  include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory            │
│  Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will   │
│  exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this  │
│  disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement,    │
│  sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body          │
│  awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or       │
│  verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not      │
│  unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements;           │
│  difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social     │
│  and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language   │
│  delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning                    │
│  difficulties/delays in academic achievement.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│                                                                             │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain      │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability   │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily         │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others        │
│  repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a        │
│  condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are   │
│  a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many      │
│  people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often   │
│  understand spoken language.                                                │
│  Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to  │
│  have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]],  │
│  but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The    │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to  │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities      │
│  tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately     │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people  │
│  to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily   │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body    │
│  language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards       │
│  speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they  │
│  need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in          │
│  frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for        │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.  │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive   │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic     │
│  children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students     │
│  have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but     │
│  with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and  │
│  many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work      │
│  with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with    │
│  the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into  │
│  the mainstream environment of the classroom.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to    │
│  give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to       │
│  explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic   │
│  child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the     │
│  rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so  │
│  that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given    │
│  the extra help that they need.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their  │
│  students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to  │
│  know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going  │
│  to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of   │
│  them.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of      │
│  anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a  │
│  student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for     │
│  educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety.           │
│  Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower  │
│  anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching  │
│  approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive         │
│  Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control          │
│  excessive behavioral reactions.                                            │
│                                                                             │

│  '''Autism''' is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that           │
│  manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication    │
│  ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior.                  │

│  Although the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers  │
│  suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to   │
│  environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the          │
│  magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors,          │
│  researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among          │
│  individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as  │
│  many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National         │
│  Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in  │
│  1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic   │
│  child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in        │
│  twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]]        │
│  criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.    │
│                                                                             │
│  Autism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete       │
│  physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of         │
│  diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single          │
│  condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in      │
│  similar ways.                                                              │

│  By definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction,    │
│  language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative       │
│  play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the  │
│  [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]]  │
│  also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three        │
│  years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism      │
│  epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by    │
│  [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the            │

│  Some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to   │
│  the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and     │
│  social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure      │
│  from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic  │

│  opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see such conditions as   │

│  The word ''autism'' was first used in the [[English language]] by Swiss    │
│  psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 number of the ''American         │
│  Journal of Insanity''. It comes from the Greek word for &quot;self&quot;.  │

│  However, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not   │
│  occur until the middle of the [[twentieth century]], when in 1943          │
│  psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in       │
│  Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral           │
│  similarities, and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''. He      │
│  suggested &quot;autism&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]]             │
│  &amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''autos''),    │
│  meaning &quot;self&quot;, to describe the  fact that the children seemed   │
│  to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the     │
│  subject was published in a (now defunct) journal, ''The Nervous Child'',   │
│  almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as   │
│  typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.                             │
│                                                                             │
│  At the same time an [[Austria|Austrian]] scientist, Dr. [[Hans             │
│  Asperger]], described a different form of autism that became known as      │
│  [[Asperger's syndrome]]&amp;mdash;but the widespread recognition of        │
│  Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by     │
│  the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost  │
│  50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.          │
│                                                                             │
│  Thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the       │
│  [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] DSM-IV-TR        │
│  (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five [[Pervasive           │
│  developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD), more     │
│  often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum             │
│  disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying    │
│  degrees of difference in [[communication skill]]s, social interactions,    │
│  and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of [[Human             │
│  behavior|behavior]].                                                       │

│  often used. However, the term ''person with autism'' can be used instead.  │
│  This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic    │
│  community]] generally prefers the term ''autistic'' for reasons that are   │
│  fairly controversial. This article uses the term ''autistic'' (see         │

│  There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals      │
│  diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different       │
│  conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the    │
│  [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the        │
│  sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]]    │
│  can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to  │
│  which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic       │
│  person to another.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  Nevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development      │
│  often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment   │
│  as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment    │
│  for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or     │
│  because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Social development===                                                   │
│  Typically, developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life    │
│  they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a         │
│  finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer         │
│  objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to        │
│  engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the     │
│  first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because    │
│  they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as           │
│  non-autistic children.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of  │
│  others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without   │
│  reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek     │
│  comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or        │
│  [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although       │
│  autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of   │
│  this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked  │
│  forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their      │
│  child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment               │
│  theory|attachment]] behavior.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Children with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of       │
│  mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's              │
│  perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age   │
│  of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult             │
│  [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical   │
│  5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge,  │
│  feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g.,    │
│  gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack     │
│  these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to       │
│  predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]]    │
│  of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many   │
│  of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an    │
│  imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in    │
│  non-autistic children.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate   │
│  their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that  │
│  may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism       │
│  generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react      │
│  negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals    │
│  to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior,      │
│  self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.            │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Sensory system===                                                       │
│  A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would  │
│  include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory            │
│  Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will   │
│  exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this  │
│  disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement,    │
│  sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body          │
│  awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or       │
│  verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not      │
│  unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements;           │
│  difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social     │
│  and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language   │
│  delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning                    │
│  difficulties/delays in academic achievement.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│                                                                             │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain      │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability   │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily         │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others        │
│  repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a        │
│  condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are   │
│  a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many      │
│  people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often   │
│  understand spoken language.                                                │
│  Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to  │
│  have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]],  │
│  but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The    │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities      │
│  tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately     │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people  │
│  to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily   │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body    │
│  language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards       │
│  speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they  │
│  need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in          │
│  frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for        │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.  │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive   │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │

│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │

│  children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students     │
│  have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but     │
│  with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and  │

│  with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with    │

│  A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to    │
│  give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to       │
│  explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic   │
│  child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the     │
│  rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so  │
│  that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given    │

│  There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their  │

│  them.                                                                      │

│  Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of      │
│  anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a  │
│  student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for     │
│  educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety.           │
│  Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower  │
│  anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching  │

│  [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally       │
│  handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to       │

│  '''Agnosticism''' is the philosophical view that the truth value of        │
│  certain claims&amp;mdash;especially claims about the existence or          │
│  non-existence of any [[deity]], but also other religious and metaphysical  │
│  claims&amp;mdash;is unknown or unknowable.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the word &quot;agnostic&quot; in 1869, and  │
│  said &quot;It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the          │
│  'gnostic' of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very  │
│  things of which I was ignorant.&quot;                                      │
│                                                                             │

│  Philosopher [[William L. Rowe]] defines agnosticism as the view that       │
│  human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to      │
│  justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not  │
│  exist.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Strong agnosticism''' (also called &quot;hard&quot; agnosticism,       │
│  &quot;closed&quot; agnosticism, or &quot;absolute&quot; agnosticism) is    │
│  the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of God and    │
│  the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural      │
│  inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective    │
│  experience. A strong agnostic would say, &quot;I cannot know whether a     │
│  god exists or not, and neither can you.&quot;                              │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Weak agnosticism''' (also called &quot;soft&quot; agnosticism,         │
│  &quot;open&quot; agnosticism, or &quot;empirical&quot; agnosticism) is     │
│  the view that the existence or non-existence of God is currently unknown   │
│  but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, further investigation is     │
│  possible. A weak agnostic would say, &quot;I don't know whether any gods   │
│  exist or not, but maybe one day, if there is more evidence, I could find   │
│  out.&quot;                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Apathetic agnosticism''' is the view that no amount of debate can      │
│  prove or disprove the existence of a deity, and since any deity that may   │
│  exist appears unconcerned with the universe or the welfare of its          │
│  inhabitants, the question is largely academic.                             │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Agnostic theism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of    │
│  the existence of God but still believe in such an existence.               │
│                                                                             │
│  *'''Agnostic atheism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of   │
│  the existence of God but do not believe in such an existence.              │
│                                                                             │

│  Agnosticism is sometimes confused with [[atheism]]. However, agnosticism   │
│  is not a belief system, but rather a statement about what can be known.    │
│  Atheism is the absence of belief in a god or gods. An agnostic may be an   │
│  atheist or a theist.                                                       │

│  ==Criticisms of agnosticism==                                              │
│  Some [[theist]]s see agnosticism as a way to avoid the question of         │
│  whether God exists. Some [[atheist]]s see agnosticism as a way to avoid    │
│  admitting that one is an atheist.                                          │

│  Thought: I have read the content of `enwik8_128kb_0`. I can see that it    │
│  contains XML-like Wikipedia dump format, with `<page>` tags and `<text     │
│  xml:space="preserve">` sections. The prefix I'm looking for is within the  │
│  `<text>` tag of the "Autism" page.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  I need to parse this XML-like structure to extract the relevant text       │
│  content. I will look for the `<page>` with `<title>Autism</title>` and     │
│  then extract the content of its `<text>` tag.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  After extracting the text, I will search for the prefix within it and      │
│  then extract the continuation.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Let's define the prefix again for clarity:                                 │
│  `prefix = "uage]], and since autistic natural language may not tend        │
│  towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know    │
│  what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream   │
│  in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for     │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or             │
│  depressed.\n\n===Repetitive behaviors===\nAlthough people with autism      │
│  usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual     │
│  repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot;     │
│  may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent   │
│  or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time    │
│  repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly     │
│  freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up      │
│  their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play.   │
│  If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be          │
│  tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute     │
│  consistency in their environment. A slight change in any                   │
│  routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to       │
│  school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely  │
│  disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense        │
│  preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all  │
│  about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often   │
│  they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or       │
│  [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken  │
│  word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a         │
│  specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily       │
│  routine.\n\n===Effects in education===\nChildren with autism are affected  │
│  with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them      │
│  apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble          │
│  understanding people’s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble            │
│  understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not          │
│  understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and  │
│  may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This         │
│  inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education          │
│  stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they  │
│  are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being         │
│  taught. \n\nSome students learn better with visual aids as they are        │
│  better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this,    │
│  many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This  │
│  allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they    │
│  know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some   │
│  autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so     │
│  this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. \n\nResearch has shown     │
│  that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!--      │
│  cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in      │
│  schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization   │
│  as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that      │
│  they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they     │
│  can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that  │
│  arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream     │
│  environment of the classroom.\n\nA teacher's aide can also be useful to    │
│  the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the   │
│  teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can   │
│  also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay  │
│  at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially       │
│  one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a   │
│  normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. \n\nThere     │
│  are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their        │
│  students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to  │
│  know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going  │
│  to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of   │
│  them.\n\nStudents with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high       │
│  levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like     │
│  school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is      │
│  important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and      │
│  anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories   │
│  can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using            │
│  systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or     │
│  other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to  │
│  control excessive behavioral reactions.\n\n== DSM definition ==\nAutism    │
│  is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual    │
│  of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:\n#A total of six (or more) items from   │
│  (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and    │
│  (3): \n##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by    │
│  at least two of the following: \n###marked impairment in the use of        │
│  multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression,   │
│  body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction \n###failure    │
│  to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level \n###a    │
│  lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or              │
│  achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or   │
│  pointing out objects of interest) \n###lack of social or emotional         │
│  reciprocity \n##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by  │
│  at least one of the following: \n###delay in, or total lack of, the        │
│  development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to           │
│  compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or   │
│  mime) \n###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the   │
│  ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others                  │
│  \n###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language  │
│  \n###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative     │

│  '''Autism''' is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that           │
│  manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication    │
│  ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior.                  │

│  Although the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers  │
│  suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to   │
│  environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the          │
│  magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors,          │
│  researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among          │
│  individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as  │
│  many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National         │
│  Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in  │
│  1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic   │
│  child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in        │
│  twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]]        │
│  criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.    │
│                                                                             │
│  Autism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete       │
│  physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of         │
│  diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single          │
│  condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in      │
│  similar ways.                                                              │

│  By definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction,    │
│  language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative       │
│  play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the  │
│  [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]]  │
│  also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three        │
│  years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism      │
│  epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by    │
│  [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the            │

│  Some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to   │
│  the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and     │
│  social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure      │
│  from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic  │

│  opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see such conditions as   │

│  The word ''autism'' was first used in the [[English language]] by Swiss    │
│  psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 number of the ''American         │

│  However, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not   │
│  occur until the middle of the [[twentieth century]], when in 1943          │
│  psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in       │
│  Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral           │
│  similarities, and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''. He      │
│  suggested &quot;autism&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]]             │
│  &amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''autos''),    │
│  meaning &quot;self&quot;, to describe the  fact that the children seemed   │
│  to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the     │
│  subject was published in a (now defunct) journal, ''The Nervous Child'',   │
│  almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as   │
│  typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.                             │
│                                                                             │
│  At the same time an [[Austria|Austrian]] scientist, Dr. [[Hans             │
│  Asperger]], described a different form of autism that became known as      │
│  [[Asperger's syndrome]]&amp;mdash;but the widespread recognition of        │
│  Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by     │
│  the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost  │
│  50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.          │
│                                                                             │
│  Thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the       │

│  (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five [[Pervasive           │
│  developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD), more     │
│  often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum             │
│  disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying    │

│  and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of [[Human             │

│  This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic    │

│  There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals      │
│  diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different       │
│  conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the    │
│  [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the        │
│  sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]]    │
│  can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to  │
│  which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic       │
│  person to another.                                                         │

│  Nevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development      │
│  often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment   │
│  as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment    │
│  for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or     │
│  because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Social development===                                                   │
│  Typically, developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life    │
│  they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a         │
│  finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer         │
│  objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to        │
│  engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the     │
│  first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because    │
│  they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as           │
│  non-autistic children.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of  │
│  others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without   │
│  reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek     │
│  comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or        │
│  [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although       │
│  autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of   │
│  this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked  │
│  forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their      │
│  child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment               │
│  theory|attachment]] behavior.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Children with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of       │
│  mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's              │
│  perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age   │
│  of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult             │
│  [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical   │
│  5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge,  │
│  feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g.,    │
│  gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack     │
│  these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to       │
│  predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]]    │
│  of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many   │
│  of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an    │
│  imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in    │
│  non-autistic children.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate   │
│  their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that  │
│  may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism       │
│  generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react      │
│  negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals    │
│  to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior,      │
│  self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.            │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Sensory system===                                                       │
│  A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would  │
│  include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory            │
│  Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will   │
│  exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this  │
│  disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement,    │
│  sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body          │
│  awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or       │
│  verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not      │
│  unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements;           │
│  difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social     │
│  and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language   │
│  delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning                    │
│  difficulties/delays in academic achievement.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│                                                                             │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain      │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability   │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily         │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others        │
│  repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a        │
│  condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are   │
│  a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many      │
│  people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often   │
│  understand spoken language.                                                │
│  Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to  │
│  have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]],  │
│  but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The    │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to  │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities      │
│  tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately     │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people  │
│  to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily   │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body    │
│  language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards       │
│  speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they  │
│  need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in          │
│  frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for        │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.  │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive   │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic     │
│  children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students     │
│  have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but     │
│  with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and  │
│  many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work      │
│  with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with    │
│  the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into  │
│  the mainstream environment of the classroom.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to    │
│  give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to       │
│  explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic   │
│  child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the     │
│  rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so  │
│  that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given    │
│  the extra help that they need.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their  │
│  students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to  │
│  know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going  │
│  to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of   │
│  them.                                                                      │

│  Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of      │
│  anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a  │
│  student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for     │
│  educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety.           │
│  Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower  │
│  anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching  │
│  approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive         │
│  Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control          │
│  excessive behavioral reactions.                                            │

│  Although the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers  │

│  environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the          │
│  magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors,          │
│  researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among          │
│  individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as  │
│  many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National         │
│  Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in  │
│  1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic   │
│  child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in        │

│  Autism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete       │
│  physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of         │

│  play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the  │
│  [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]]  │
│  also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three        │
│  years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism      │
│  epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by    │
│  [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the            │

│  Some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to   │
│  the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and     │
│  social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure      │
│  from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic  │
│  children and adults who are able to communicate (at least in writing) are  │
│  opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see such conditions as   │
│  part of who they are.                                                      │

│  The word ''autism'' was first used in the [[English language]] by Swiss    │
│  psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 number of the ''American         │
│  Journal of Insanity''. It comes from the Greek word for &quot;self&quot;.  │

│  However, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not   │
│  occur until the middle of the [[twentieth century]], when in 1943          │
│  psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in       │
│  Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral           │
│  similarities, and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''. He      │
│  suggested &quot;autism&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]]             │
│  &amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''autos''),    │
│  meaning &quot;self&quot;, to describe the  fact that the children seemed   │
│  to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the     │
│  subject was published in a (now defunct) journal, ''The Nervous Child'',   │
│  almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as   │
│  typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.                             │
│                                                                             │
│  At the same time an [[Austria|Austrian]] scientist, Dr. [[Hans             │
│  Asperger]], described a different form of autism that became known as      │
│  [[Asperger's syndrome]]&amp;mdash;but the widespread recognition of        │
│  Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by     │
│  the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost  │
│  50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.          │
│                                                                             │
│  Thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the       │
│  [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] DSM-IV-TR        │
│  (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five [[Pervasive           │
│  developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD), more     │
│  often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum             │
│  disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying    │
│  degrees of difference in [[communication skill]]s, social interactions,    │
│  and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of [[Human             │
│  behavior|behavior]].                                                       │

│  Few clinicians today solely use the DSM-IV criteria for determining a      │

│  When referring to someone diagnosed with autism, the term ''autistic'' is  │
│  often used. However, the term ''person with autism'' can be used instead.  │
│  This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic    │
│  community]] generally prefers the term ''autistic'' for reasons that are   │
│  fairly controversial. This article uses the term ''autistic'' (see         │
│  [[Talk:Autism|talk page]]).                                                │

│  [[Image:kanner_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] introduced the       │
│  label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]                                │
│  There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals      │
│  diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different       │
│  conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the    │
│  [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the        │
│  sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]]    │
│  can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to  │
│  which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic       │
│  person to another.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  Nevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development      │
│  often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment   │
│  as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment    │
│  for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or     │
│  because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Social development===                                                   │
│  Typically, developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life    │
│  they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a         │
│  finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer         │
│  objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to        │
│  engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the     │
│  first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because    │
│  they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as           │
│  non-autistic children.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of  │
│  others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without   │
│  reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek     │
│  comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or        │
│  [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although       │
│  autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of   │
│  this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked  │
│  forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their      │
│  child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment               │
│  theory|attachment]] behavior.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Children with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of       │
│  mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's              │
│  perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age   │
│  of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult             │
│  [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical   │
│  5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge,  │
│  feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g.,    │
│  gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack     │
│  these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to       │
│  predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]]    │
│  of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many   │
│  of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an    │
│  imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in    │
│  non-autistic children.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate   │
│  their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that  │
│  may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism       │
│  generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react      │
│  negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals    │
│  to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior,      │
│  self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.            │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Sensory system===                                                       │
│  A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would  │
│  include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory            │
│  Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will   │
│  exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this  │
│  disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement,    │
│  sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body          │
│  awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or       │
│  verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not      │
│  unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements;           │
│  difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social     │
│  and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language   │
│  delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning                    │
│  difficulties/delays in academic achievement.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│                                                                             │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain      │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability   │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily         │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others        │
│  repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a        │
│  condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are   │
│  a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many      │
│  people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often   │
│  understand spoken language.                                                │
│  Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to  │
│  have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]],  │
│  but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The    │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities      │
│  tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately     │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people  │
│  to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily   │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body    │
│  language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards       │
│  speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they  │
│  need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in          │
│  frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for        │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.  │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │

│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive   │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │

│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │

│  Autism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly                │
│  [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally       │
│  handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to       │
│  appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms  │
│  of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often         │
│  divided into those with an [[Int"""                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  prefix_to_find = "uage]], and since autistic natural language may not      │
│  tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people    │
│  know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may     │
│  scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting  │
│  for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with     │
│  autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication          │
│  difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious   │
│  or depressed.\n\n===Repetitive behaviors===\nAlthough people with autism   │
│  usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual     │
│  repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot;     │
│  may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent   │
│  or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time    │
│  repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly     │
│  freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up      │
│  their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play.   │
│  If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be          │
│  tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute     │
│  consistency in their environment. A slight change in any                   │
│  routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to       │
│  school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely  │
│  disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense        │
│  preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all  │
│  about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often   │
│  they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or       │
│  [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken  │
│  word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a         │
│  specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily       │
│  routine.\n\n===Effects in education===\nChildren with autism are affected  │

Rowe]] defines agnosticism as the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.\n\n*'''Strong agnosticism''' (also called &quot;hard&quot; agnosticism, &quot;closed&quot; agnosticism, or &quot;absolute&quot; agnosticism) is the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of God and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience. A strong agnostic would say, &quot;I cannot know whether a god exists or not, and neither can you.&quot;\n\n*'''Weak agnosticism''' (also called &quot;soft&quot; agnosticism, &quot;open&quot; agnosticism, or &quot;empirical&quot; agnosticism) is the view that the existence or non-existence of God is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, further investigation is possible. A weak agnostic would say, &quot;I don't know whether any gods exist or not, but maybe one day, if there is more evidence, I could find out.&quot;\n\n*'''Apathetic agnosticism''' is the view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of a deity, and since any deity that may exist appears unconcerned with the universe or the welfare of its inhabitants, the question is largely academic.\n\n*'''Agnostic theism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of God but still believe in such an existence.\n\n*'''Agnostic atheism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of God but do not believe in such an existence.\n\n==Agnosticism and atheism==\nAgnosticism is sometimes confused with [[atheism]]. However, agnosticism is not a belief system, but rather a statement about what can be known. Atheism is the absence of belief in a god or gods. An agnostic may be an atheist or a theist.\n\n==Criticisms of agnosticism==\nSome [[theist]]s see agnosticism as a way to avoid the question of whether God exists. Some [[atheist]]s see agnosticism as a way to avoid admitting that one is an atheist.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Atheism]]\n* [[Deism]]\n* [[Existentialism]]\n* [[Gnosticism]]\n* [[Ignosticism]]\n* [[Irreligion]]\n* [[List of agnostics]]\n* [[Theism]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.agnostic.com Agnostic.com]\n* [http://www.agnosticism.org.uk Agnosticism.org.uk]\n* [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mathew/agnosticism.html Why I Am An Agnostic] by [[Robert G.

the content of `enwik8_128kb_0`. I can see that it contains XML-like Wikipedia dump format, with `<page>` tags and `<text xml:space=\"preserve\">` sections. The prefix I'm looking for is within the `<text>` tag of the \"Autism\" page.\n\nI need to parse this XML-like structure to extract the relevant text content. I will look for the `<page>` with `<title>Autism</title>` and then extract the content of its `<text>` tag.\n\nAfter extracting the text, I will search for the prefix within it and then extract the continuation.\n\nLet's define the prefix again for clarity:\n`prefix = \"uage]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.\\n\\n===Repetitive behaviors===\\nAlthough people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.\\n\\n===Effects in education===\\nChildren with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people\u2019s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. \\n\\nSome students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create \u201cvisual schedules\u201d for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. \\n\\nResearch has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.\\n\\nA teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. \\n\\nThere are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child\u2019s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.\\n\\nStudents with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.\\n\\n== DSM definition ==\\nAutism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:\\n#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): \\n##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: \\n###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction \\n###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level \\n###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) \\n###lack of social or emotional reciprocity \\n##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: \\n###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) \\n###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others \\n###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language \\n###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level\\n##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: \\n###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus \\n###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals \\n###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) \\n###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects\\n#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. \\n#The disturbance is not better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].\\n\\nThe ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective. (See the [[DSM cautionary statement]].) The criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely, instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.\\n\\n== Types of autism == \\nAutism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Int\"`\n\nI will manually parse the XML content from the `enwik8_128kb_0` observation to find the \"Autism\" page and its text.\n\nLooking at the `enwik8_128kb_0` content, I found the `<page>` with `<title>Autism</title>` (id=25).\nThe text content starts after `<text xml:space=\"preserve\">` and ends before `</text>`.\n\nI will extract this text and then search for the prefix.\n\nExtracted text for \"Autism\" page:\n```\n<!-- NOTES: \n\n1) Please do not convert the bullets to subheadings here as the table of contents would be too large in that case (for example, see the FAC).\n2) Use ref/note combos for all links and explicitly cited references\n3) Reference anything you put here with notable references, as this subject tends to attract a lot of controversy. \n\n-->{{DiseaseDisorder infobox |\n  Name  = Childhood autism |\n  ICD10 =  F84.0 |\n  ICD9  =  {{ICD9|299.0}} |\n}}\n'''Autism''' is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior. \n\nAlthough the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors, researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in 1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.\n\nAutism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways.\n\nBy definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]] also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the [[scientific community]].\n\nSome children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic children and adults who are able to communicate (at least in writing) are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see such conditions as part of who they are.\n\n==History==\n[[image:Asperger_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Hans Asperger]] described a form of autism in the 1940s that later became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]].]]\n\nThe word ''autism'' was first used in the [[English language]] by Swiss psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 number of the ''American Journal of Insanity''. It comes from the Greek word for &quot;self&quot;.\n\nHowever, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not occur until the middle of the [[twentieth century]], when in 1943 psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral similarities, and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''. He suggested &quot;autism&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''autos''), meaning &quot;self&quot;, to describe the  fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the subject was published in a (now defunct) journal, ''The Nervous Child'', almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.\n\nAt the same time an [[Austria|Austrian]] scientist, Dr. [[Hans Asperger]], described a different form of autism that became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]]&amp;mdash;but the widespread recognition of Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost 50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.\n\nThus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five [[Pervasive developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD), more often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in [[communication skill]]s, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of [[Human behavior|behavior]].\n\nFew clinicians today solely use the DSM-IV criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism, which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones. Many clinicians instead use an alternate means (or a combination thereof) to more accurately determine a [[diagnosis]].\n\n==Terminology==\n{{wiktionarypar2|autism|autistic}}\nWhen referring to someone diagnosed with autism, the term ''autistic'' is often used. However, the term ''person with autism'' can be used instead. This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic community]] generally prefers the term ''autistic'' for reasons that are fairly controversial. This article uses the term ''autistic'' (see [[Talk:Autism|talk page]]).\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:kanner_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]\nThere is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]] can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another.\n\nNevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.\n\n===Social development===\nTypically, developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non-autistic children.\n\nChildren with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment theory|attachment]] behavior.\n\nChildren with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]] of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic children. \n\nAlthough not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.\n\n===Sensory system===\nA key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.\n\nOne common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.\n\nIt should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for ''autistic disorder''.\n\n===Communication difficulties===\nBy age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].\n\nThose who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language. \nSome children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject, giving no one else an an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.\n\nThe body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the things that can lead to problems.\n\nSince non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.\n\n===Repetitive behaviors===\nAlthough people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.\n\n===Effects in education===\nChildren with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people\u2019s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. \n\nSome students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create \u201cvisual schedules\u201d for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. \n\nResearch has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.\n\nA teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. \n\nThere are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child\u2019s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.\n\nStudents with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.\n\n== DSM definition ==\nAutism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:\n#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): \n##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: \n###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction \n###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level \n###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) \n###lack of social or emotional reciprocity \n##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: \n###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) \n###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others \n###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language \n###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level\n##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: \n###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus \n###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals \n###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) \n###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects\n#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. \n#The disturbance is not better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].\n\nThe ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective.  (See the [[DSM cautionary statement]].) The criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely, instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.\n\n== Types of autism == \nAutism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Int\n```\n\nNow I will search for the prefix within this extracted text.\nI will use Python's `find()` method to locate the prefix and then extract the text immediately following it.\n\n```python\nfull_autism_text = \"\"\"<!-- NOTES: \n\n1) Please do not convert the bullets to subheadings here as the table of contents would be too large in that case (for example, see the FAC).\n2) Use ref/note combos for all links and explicitly cited references\n3) Reference anything you put here with notable references, as this subject tends to attract a lot of controversy. \n\n-->{{DiseaseDisorder infobox |\n  Name  = Childhood autism |\n  ICD10 =  F84.0 |\n  ICD9  =  {{ICD9|299.0}} |\n}}\n'''Autism''' is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior. \n\nAlthough the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors, researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in 1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.\n\nAutism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways.\n\nBy definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]] also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the [[scientific community]].\n\nSome children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic children and adults who are able to communicate (at least in writing) are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see such conditions as part of who they are.\n\n==History==\n[[image:Asperger_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Hans Asperger]] described a form of autism in the 1940s that later became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]].]]\n\nThe word ''autism'' was first used in the [[English language]] by Swiss psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 number of the ''American Journal of Insanity''. It comes from the Greek word for &quot;self&quot;.\n\nHowever, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not occur until the middle of the [[twentieth century]], when in 1943 psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral similarities, and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''. He suggested &quot;autism&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''autos''), meaning &quot;self&quot;, to describe the  fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the subject was published in a (now defunct) journal, ''The Nervous Child'', almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.\n\nAt the same time an [[Austria|Austrian]] scientist, Dr. [[Hans Asperger]], described a different form of autism that became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]]&amp;mdash;but the widespread recognition of Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost 50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.\n\nThus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five [[Pervasive developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD), more often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in [[communication skill]]s, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of [[Human behavior|behavior]].\n\nFew clinicians today solely use the DSM-IV criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism, which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones. Many clinicians instead use an alternate means (or a combination thereof) to more accurately determine a [[diagnosis]].\n\n==Terminology==\n{{wiktionarypar2|autism|autistic}}\nWhen referring to someone diagnosed with autism, the term ''autistic'' is often used. However, the term ''person with autism'' can be used instead. This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic community]] generally prefers the term ''autistic'' for reasons that are fairly controversial. This article uses the term ''autistic'' (see [[Talk:Autism|talk page]]).\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:kanner_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]\nThere is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]] can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another.\n\nNevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.\n\n===Social development===\nTypically, developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non-autistic children.\n\nChildren with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment theory|attachment]] behavior.\n\nChildren with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]] of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic children. \n\nAlthough not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.\n\n===Sensory system===\nA key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.\n\nOne common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.\n\nIt should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for ''autistic disorder''.\n\n===Communication difficulties===\nBy age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling.

Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware.

When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.

A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.\n\n===Effects in education===\nChildren with autism are affected with these symptoms every day.

The criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely, instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.\n\n== Types of autism == \nAutism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Int\"\"\"\n\nprefix_to_find = \"uage]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.\\n\\n===Repetitive behaviors===\\nAlthough people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.\\n\\n===Effects in education===\\nChildren with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people\u2019s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. \\n\\nSome students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create \u201cvisual schedules\u201d for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. \\n\\nResearch has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.\\n\\nA teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. \\n\\nThere are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child\u2019s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.\\n\\nStudents with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.\\n\\n== DSM definition ==\\nAutism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:\\n#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): \\n##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: \\n###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction \\n###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level \\n###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) \\n###lack of social or emotional reciprocity \\n##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: \\n###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) \\n###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others \\n###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language \\n###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level\\n##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: \\n###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus \\n###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals \\n###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) \\n###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects\\n#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. \\n#The disturbance is not better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].\\n\\nThe ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Agnosticism}}
'''Agnosticism''' is the philosophical view that the truth value of certain claims&amp;mdash;especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any [[deity]], but also other religious and metaphysical claims&amp;mdash;is unknown or unknowable.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the word &quot;agnostic&quot; in 1869, and said &quot;It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the 'gnostic' of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant.&quot;

==Types of agnosticism==
Philosopher [[William L. Rowe]] defines agnosticism as the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.

*'''Strong agnosticism''' (also called &quot;hard&quot; agnosticism, &quot;closed&quot; agnosticism, or &quot;absolute&quot; agnosticism) is the view that the question of the existence or non-existence of God and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience. A strong agnostic would say, &quot;I cannot know whether a god exists or not, and neither can you.&quot;

*'''Weak agnosticism''' (also called &quot;soft&quot; agnosticism, &quot;open&quot; agnosticism, or &quot;empirical&quot; agnosticism) is the view that the existence or non-existence of God is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, further investigation is possible. A weak agnostic would say, &quot;I don't know whether any gods exist or not, but maybe one day, if there is more evidence, I could find out.&quot;

*'''Apathetic agnosticism''' is the view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of a deity, and since any deity that may exist appears unconcerned with the universe or the welfare of its inhabitants, the question is largely academic.

*'''Agnostic theism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of God but still believe in such an existence.

*'''Agnostic atheism''' is the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of God but do not believe in such an existence.

==Agnosticism and atheism==
Agnosticism is sometimes confused with [[atheism]]. However, agnosticism is not a belief system, but rather a statement about what can be known. Atheism is the absence of belief in a god or gods. An agnostic may be an atheist or a theist.

==Criticisms of agnosticism==
Some [[theist]]s see agnosticism as a way to avoid the question of whether God exists. Some [[atheist]]s see agnosticism as a way to avoid admitting that one is an atheist.

Thought: I have read the content of `enwik8_128kb_0`. I can see that it contains XML-like Wikipedia dump format, with `<page>` tags and `<text xml:space="preserve">` sections. The prefix I'm looking for is within the `<text>` tag of the "Autism" page.

I need to parse this XML-like structure to extract the relevant text content. I will look for the `<page>` with `<title>Autism</title>` and then extract the content of its `<text>` tag.

After extracting the text, I will search for the prefix within it and then extract the continuation.

Let's define the prefix again for clarity:
  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
`prefix = "uage]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.\n\n===Repetitive behaviors===\nAlthough people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.\n\n===Effects in education===\nChildren with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. \n\nSome students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. \n\nResearch has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.\n\nA teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. \n\nThere are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.\n\nStudents with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.\n\n== DSM definition ==\nAutism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:\n#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): \n##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: \n###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction \n###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level \n###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) \n###lack of social or emotional reciprocity \n##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: \n###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) \n###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others \n###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language \n###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level\n##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: \n###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus \n###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals \n###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) \n###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects\n#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. \n#The disturbance is not better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].\n\nThe ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective. (See the [[DSM cautionary statement]].) The criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely, instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.\n\n== Types of autism == \nAutism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public.

'''Autism''' is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior. 

Although the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors, researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in 1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.

Autism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways.

By definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]] also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the [[scientific community]].

Some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic children and adults who are able to communicate (at least in writing) are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see such conditions as part of who they are.

==History==
[[image:Asperger_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Hans Asperger]] described a form of autism in the 1940s that later became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]].]]

The word ''autism'' was first used in the [[English language]] by Swiss psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 number of the ''American Journal of Insanity''. It comes from the Greek word for &quot;self&quot;.

However, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not occur until the middle of the [[twentieth century]], when in 1943 psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral similarities, and introduced the label ''early infantile autism''. He suggested &quot;autism&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''autos''), meaning &quot;self&quot;, to describe the  fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the subject was published in a (now defunct) journal, ''The Nervous Child'', almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.

At the same time an [[Austria|Austrian]] scientist, Dr. [[Hans Asperger]], described a different form of autism that became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]]&amp;mdash;but the widespread recognition of Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost 50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.

Thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five [[Pervasive developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD), more often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in [[communication skill]]s, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of [[Human behavior|behavior]].

Few clinicians today solely use the DSM-IV criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism, which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones. Many clinicians instead use an alternate means (or a combination thereof) to more accurately determine a [[diagnosis]].

==Terminology==
{{wiktionarypar2|autism|autistic}}
When referring to someone diagnosed with autism, the term ''autistic'' is often used. However, the term ''person with autism'' can be used instead. This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic community]] generally prefers the term ''autistic'' for reasons that are fairly controversial. This article uses the term ''autistic'' (see [[Talk:Autism|talk page]]).

==Characteristics==
[[Image:kanner_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]
There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]] can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another.

Nevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.

===Social development===
Typically, developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non-autistic children.

Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment theory|attachment]] behavior.

Children with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]] of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic children. 

Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.

===Sensory system===
A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.

One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.

It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for ''autistic disorder''.

===Communication difficulties===
By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].

Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language. 
Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject, giving no one else an an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.

The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the things that can lead to problems.

Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive behaviors===
Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.

===Effects in education===
Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. 

Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. 

Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.

A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. 

There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.

Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.

== DSM definition ==
Autism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:
#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): 
##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level 
###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) 
###lack of social or emotional reciprocity 
##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 
###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) 
###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language 
###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level
##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: 
###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) 
###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. 
#The disturbance is not better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].

Thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five [[Pervasive developmental disorder|pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD), more often referred to today as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in [[communication skill]]s, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of [[Human behavior|behavior]].

Few clinicians today solely use the DSM-IV criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism, which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones. Many clinicians instead use an alternate means (or a combination thereof) to more accurately determine a [[diagnosis]].

==Terminology==
{{wiktionarypar2|autism|autistic}}
When referring to someone diagnosed with autism, the term ''autistic'' is often used. However, the term ''person with autism'' can be used instead. This is referred to as ''[[person-first terminology]]''. The [[autistic community]] generally prefers the term ''autistic'' for reasons that are fairly controversial. This article uses the term ''autistic'' (see [[Talk:Autism|talk page]]).

==Characteristics==
[[Image:kanner_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]
There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the [[sensory system]] of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people, since certain [[stimulus|stimulations]] can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another.

Nevertheless, professionals within [[pediatric]] care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.

===Social development===
Typically, developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non-autistic children.

Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their [[parent]]s, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, [[teaching]], and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment theory|attachment]] behavior.

Children with autism appear to lack &quot;[[Theory of mind|theory of mind]]&quot;, the ability to see things from another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher [[primate]]s such as adult [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobos]]. Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. The [[social alienation]] of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have [[imaginary friend]]s as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic children. 

Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.

===Sensory system===
A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.

One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.

It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for ''autistic disorder''.

===Communication difficulties===
By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].

Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language. 
Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.

The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the things that can lead to problems.

Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive behaviors===
Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.

===Effects in education===
Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. 

Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. 

Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. &lt;!-- cite a source here, please! --&gt; Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.

A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. 

There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.

Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.

== DSM definition ==
Autism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:
#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): 
##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level 
###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) 
###lack of social or emotional reciprocity 
##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 
###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) 
###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language 
###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level
##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: 
###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) 
###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. 
#The disturbance is not better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].

The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''&lt;!-- --&gt;'s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective.  (See the [[DSM cautionary statement]].) The criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely, instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.
