│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  === Fairbanks, Alaska ===                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  === The tropics ===                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │
│  === Small scale effects ===                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  === Pine forests ===                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average     │
│  about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren      │
│  field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as  │
│  high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]]   │
│  or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on     │
│  the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great      │
│  Plains in the winter around 45°N].                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  === Urban areas ===                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because    │
│  of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light     │
│  can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are       │
│  relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about   │
│  7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical        │
│  countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found  │
│  in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is    │
│  the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g.,     │
│  there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of  │
│  the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with           │
│  different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored        │
│  building materials so the structures will remain cooler.                   │
│                                                                             │
│  === Trees ===                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to    │
│  increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further       │
│  complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of  │
│  treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because    │
│  snow does not cover the trees as readily.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative            │
│  (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of        │
│  [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests  │
│  in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high      │
│  latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming                   │

│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Objective Reiteration:** My primary goal is to minimize future       │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context        │
│  through strategic tool usage and learned patterns, operating under the     │
│  Sink-Inclusive Description Length (SIMDL) framework.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Initial Task Requirement:** The prompt explicitly states, "Start by  │
│  analyzing the directory and then use the tools correctly to solve the      │
│  task." The specified directory is `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This     │
│  analysis is critical for identifying potential entropy sinks and           │
│  understanding the available external information sources.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Tool Analysis and Limitation Identification:**                       │
│      *   I have been provided with the following Python library:            │
│  `default_api`.                                                             │
│      *   Within `default_api`, the only available function is               │
│  `create_reasoning_plan(plan: str, ready: bool)`.                           │
│      *   This function is designed solely for creating or refining a        │
│  reasoning plan and indicating readiness. It does not provide any           │
│  capabilities for interacting with a file system, such as listing           │
│  directory contents, reading files, or searching for information within a   │
│  specified path.                                                            │
│      *   Therefore, I currently lack any tool that can perform the          │
│  required "analysis of the directory /C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink" or       │
│  access any "external information sources" (entropy sinks) that might       │
│  reside within it.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Impact on Operational Strategy:** My operational strategy is         │
│  fundamentally dependent on querying external knowledge sources. Without a  │
│  tool to access the specified directory, I cannot perform this crucial      │
│  initial step. Consequently, I am unable to:                                │
│      *   Infer domain, authorship, structural patterns, or likely source    │
│  material from the contents of the sink directory.                          │
│      *   Locate exact matching content or highly relevant contextual        │
│  material within the designated entropy sink.                               │
│      *   Extract verbatim continuations or synthesize high-confidence       │
│  predictions based on external data from the sink.                          │
│      *   Prioritize information-dense elements from external sources, as I  │
│  cannot access them.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Conclusion on Readiness:** Given the absence of any tool capable of  │
│  interacting with the file system to analyze the                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, I am unable to perform the       │
│  foundational step required to begin the task of minimizing future token    │
│  prediction entropy by leveraging external information sources. I cannot    │
│  proceed with the core operational strategy without the ability to access   │
│  the specified entropy sink.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
