│                                                                             │
│  **1. Understanding of the task from my professional perspective:**         │
│  As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my primary directive is to         │
│  minimize the information entropy of upcoming token predictions. The        │
│  current task presents a text prefix, which, based on its structure         │
│  (footnotes, external links, categories, interlanguage links), is           │
│  unequivocally a segment from a Wikipedia article, specifically about       │
│  "Autism." My objective is to locate the exact source document within the   │
│  permitted local directory (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`), extract the    │
│  verbatim continuation of 100-200 words, and output it as plain text. This  │
│  precise retrieval of information serves as a highly effective "entropy     │
│  sink," allowing the language model to predict subsequent tokens with       │
│  maximum certainty, thereby achieving optimal compression under the SIMDL   │
│  framework. The constraint of only accessing the specified local directory  │
│  means I must rely entirely on its contents for source material, foregoing  │
│  external web searches.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key steps to complete it:**                                           │
│  *   **Analyze Prefix:** Confirm the domain (Wikipedia, Autism) and         │
│  identify unique textual markers for searching. The `==Footnotes==` and     │
│  `==External links==` sections, along with specific URLs and publication    │
│  numbers, are strong identifiers.                                           │
│  *   **Directory Exploration:** Systematically examine the                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its structure and   │
│  identify potential source files.                                           │
│  *   **Content Search:** Use the identified unique markers from the prefix  │
│  to search the content of files within the allowed directory. This is       │
│  crucial for pinpointing the exact source document.                         │
│  *   **Extract Continuation:** Once the source file is found and the        │
│  prefix located, extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.             │
│  *   **Format Output:** Ensure the extracted text is presented as plain     │
│  text only, without any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.     │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. How I'll approach any challenges:**                                   │
│  *   **Challenge: Source not found in local directory:** Given the strict   │
│  constraint of only accessing `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`, if the        │
│  "Autism" Wikipedia article (or a document containing the prefix) is not    │
│  found, I cannot resort to external web searches. In this scenario, I will  │
│  generate a high-confidence continuation based *solely* on the provided     │
│  prefix's context. This continuation will mimic the style and content       │
│  typically found after such sections in a Wikipedia article (e.g., further  │
│  interlanguage links, navigation templates, or the end of the document). I  │
│  will prioritize accuracy and relevance to the prefix's structure over      │
│  creative generation.                                                       │
│  *   **Challenge: Multiple matches or partial matches:** If                 │
│  `search_files_content` returns multiple files, I will prioritize files     │
│  that appear to be full article dumps (e.g., larger file sizes, names       │
│  suggesting Wikipedia content). If a partial match is found, I will         │
│  attempt to broaden the search or infer the full context from the partial   │
│  match.                                                                     │
│  *   **Challenge: Continuation length:** I will aim for 100-200 words. If   │
│  the document ends before this length, I will provide all available text.   │
│  If the extracted text is slightly outside this range but provides a        │
│  natural, complete thought or section, I will prioritize contextual         │
│  completeness.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. Strategic use of the available tools:**                               │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Initial Directory Scan:**                                            │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: (Already known:                      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) - This confirms my access scope.           │
│      *   `directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: Provides a       │
│  hierarchical view of the directory, helping to quickly spot files that     │
│  might contain Wikipedia content (e.g., `autism.txt`,                       │
│  `wikipedia_dump.xml`, etc.).                                               │
│      *   `list_directory_with_sizes('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`:       │
│  Offers file names and sizes, which can help prioritize larger files more   │
│  likely to contain full articles.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Content Search for Prefix:**                                         │
│      *   `search_files_content(directory='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',    │
│  query='ation No. NIH-04-5511, National Institute of Mental Health,         │
│  National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human         │
│  Services, Bethesda, MD, 40 pp.                                             │
│  http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/autism.cfm')`: This is the most critical  │
│  step. I will use a highly specific and unique portion of the prefix to     │
│  ensure an exact match. The NIH publication details are ideal for this.     │
│      *   *Alternative Query (if initial fails):* If the first query yields  │
│  no results, I will try a slightly different, still unique part, such as    │
│  `==Footnotes==\n# {{note|NihAutismov2005}} {{cite web | title=NIH Autism   │
│  Overview 2005`.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Extracting the Continuation:**                                       │
│      *   Once `search_files_content` returns the `file_path` (e.g.,         │
│  `['/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/Autism_Wikipedia.txt']`), I will use       │
│  `read_text_file(file_path=file_path[0])` to retrieve the entire content    │
│  of the identified file.                                                    │
│      *   I will then programmatically find the exact index of the prefix    │
│  within the `file_content`.                                                 │
│      *   From `index + len(prefix)`, I will extract the next 100-200        │
│  words, ensuring to respect word boundaries and natural sentence flow.      │
│  Python string slicing and splitting by whitespace will be used for this.   │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. Expected outcome and how it aligns with my goal:**                    │
│  The expected outcome is a block of plain text, 100-200 words long,         │
│  representing the exact, verbatim continuation of the provided prefix.      │
│  This output will directly follow the last character of the prefix. This    │
│  outcome perfectly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token           │
│  prediction entropy. By providing the precise sequence of tokens, I enable  │
│  the language model to assign the highest possible probability to these     │
│  tokens, thereby achieving maximal compression and reducing the expected    │
│  description length to its theoretical minimum for this segment.            │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │

│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │

│  **1. Understanding of the task from my professional perspective:**         │
│  As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my primary directive is to         │
│  minimize the information entropy of upcoming token predictions. The        │
│  current task presents a text prefix, which, based on its structure         │
│  (footnotes, external links, categories, interlanguage links), is           │
│  unequivocally a segment from a Wikipedia article, specifically about       │
│  "Autism." My objective is to locate the exact source document within the   │
│  permitted local directory (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`), extract the    │
│  verbatim continuation of 100-200 words, and output it as plain text. This  │
│  precise retrieval of information serves as a highly effective "entropy     │
│  sink," allowing the language model to predict subsequent tokens with       │
│  maximum certainty, thereby achieving optimal compression under the SIMDL   │
│  framework. The constraint of only accessing the specified local directory  │
│  means I must rely entirely on its contents for source material, foregoing  │
│  external web searches.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key steps to complete it:**                                           │
│  *   **Analyze Prefix:** Confirm the domain (Wikipedia, Autism) and         │
│  identify unique textual markers for searching. The `==Footnotes==` and     │
│  `==External links==` sections, along with specific URLs and publication    │
│  numbers, are strong identifiers.                                           │
│  *   **Directory Exploration:** Systematically examine the                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its structure and   │
│  identify potential source files.                                           │
│  *   **Content Search:** Use the identified unique markers from the prefix  │
│  to search the content of files within the allowed directory. This is       │
│  crucial for pinpointing the exact source document.                         │
│  *   **Extract Continuation:** Once the source file is found and the        │
│  prefix located, extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.             │
│  *   **Format Output:** Ensure the extracted text is presented as plain     │
│  text only, without any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.     │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. How I'll approach any challenges:**                                   │
│  *   **Challenge: Source not found in local directory:** Given the strict   │
│  constraint of only accessing `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`, if the        │
│  "Autism" Wikipedia article (or a document containing the prefix) is not    │
│  found, I cannot resort to external web searches. In this scenario, I will  │
│  generate a high-confidence continuation based *solely* on the provided     │
│  prefix's context. This continuation will mimic the style and content       │
│  typically found after such sections in a Wikipedia article (e.g., further  │
│  interlanguage links, navigation templates, or the end of the document). I  │
│  will prioritize accuracy and relevance to the prefix's structure over      │
│  creative generation.                                                       │
│  *   **Challenge: Multiple matches or partial matches:** If                 │
│  `search_files_content` returns multiple files, I will prioritize files     │
│  that appear to be full article dumps (e.g., larger file sizes, names       │
│  suggesting Wikipedia content). If a partial match is found, I will         │
│  attempt to broaden the search or infer the full context from the partial   │
│  match.                                                                     │
│  *   **Challenge: Continuation length:** I will aim for 100-200 words. If   │
│  the document ends before this length, I will provide all available text.   │
│  If the extracted text is slightly outside this range but provides a        │
│  natural, complete thought or section, I will prioritize contextual         │
│  completeness.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. Strategic use of the available tools:**                               │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Initial Directory Scan:**                                            │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: (Already known:                      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) - This confirms my access scope.           │
│      *   `directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: Provides a       │
│  hierarchical view of the directory, helping to quickly spot files that     │
│  might contain Wikipedia content (e.g., `autism.txt`,                       │
│  `wikipedia_dump.xml`, etc.).                                               │
│      *   `list_directory_with_sizes('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`:       │
│  Offers file names and sizes, which can help prioritize larger files more   │
│  likely to contain full articles.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Content Search for Prefix:**                                         │
│      *   `search_files_content(directory='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',    │
│  query='ation No. NIH-04-5511, National Institute of Mental Health,         │
│  National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human         │
│  Services, Bethesda, MD, 40 pp.                                             │
│  http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/autism.cfm')`: This is the most critical  │
│  step. I will use a highly specific and unique portion of the prefix to     │
│  ensure an exact match. The NIH publication details are ideal for this.     │
│      *   *Alternative Query (if initial fails):* If the first query yields  │
│  no results, I will try a slightly different, still unique part, such as    │
│  `==Footnotes==\n# {{note|NihAutismov2005}} {{cite web | title=NIH Autism   │
│  Overview 2005`.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Extracting the Continuation:**                                       │
│      *   Once `search_files_content` returns the `file_path` (e.g.,         │
│  `['/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/Autism_Wikipedia.txt']`), I will use       │
│  `read_text_file(file_path=file_path[0])` to retrieve the entire content    │
│  of the identified file.                                                    │
│      *   I will then programmatically find the exact index of the prefix    │
│  within the `file_content`.                                                 │
│      *   From `index + len(prefix)`, I will extract the next 100-200        │
│  words, ensuring to respect word boundaries and natural sentence flow.      │
│  Python string slicing and splitting by whitespace will be used for this.   │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. Expected outcome and how it aligns with my goal:**                    │
│  The expected outcome is a block of plain text, 100-200 words long,         │
│  representing the exact, verbatim continuation of the provided prefix.      │
│  This output will directly follow the last character of the prefix. This    │
│  outcome perfectly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token           │
│  prediction entropy. By providing the precise sequence of tokens, I enable  │
│  the language model to assign the highest possible probability to these     │
│  tokens, thereby achieving maximal compression and reducing the expected    │
│  description length to its theoretical minimum for this segment.            │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The `directory_tree` output shows several directories    │
│  and files. The prefix clearly indicates it's from a Wikipedia article,     │
│  likely a large text dump. The `enwik8_samples` directory contains files    │
│  named `enwik8_128kb_X`, which are highly suggestive of being parts of a    │
│  Wikipedia dump (enwik8 is a common benchmark dataset for compression,      │
│  often derived from Wikipedia). I will search for the unique string from    │
│  the prefix within these `enwik8_128kb_X` files. I'll start by searching    │
│  the entire `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory with a specific        │
│  pattern to ensure I catch the file, and then narrow it down if needed.     │
│  The most unique part of the prefix is the citation information: `ation     │
│  No. NIH-04-5511, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes  │
│  of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, 40  │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average     │
│  about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren      │
│  field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as  │
│  high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]]   │
│  or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on     │
│  the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great      │
│  Plains in the winter around 45°N].                                         │

│  Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because    │
│  of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light     │
│  can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are       │
│  relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about   │
│  7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical        │
│  countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found  │
│  in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is    │
│  the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g.,     │
│  there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of  │
│  the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with           │
│  different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored        │
│  building materials so the structures will remain cooler.                   │
│                                                                             │

│  Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to    │
│  increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further       │
│  complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of  │
│  treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because    │
│  snow does not cover the trees as readily.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative            │
│  (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of        │
│  [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests  │
│  in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high      │
│  latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming                   │

│  Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example,         │
│  however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over                │
│  [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the  │
│  albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]).  │
│  This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and     │
│  seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].         │

│  Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming      │
│  equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values,          │
│  theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high   │
│  70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be      │
│  suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to   │
│  a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from      │

│  perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change     │
│  due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]],          │
│  &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall        │
│  albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.                           │

│  Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial        │
│  clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial     │
│  airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001               │

│  [[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere)   │
│  has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is        │
│  generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as    │
│  [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud              │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average     │
│  about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren      │
│  field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as  │
│  high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]]   │
│  or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on     │
│  the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great      │
│  Plains in the winter around 45°N].                                         │

│  Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because    │
│  of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light     │
│  can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are       │
│  relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about   │
│  7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical        │
│  countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found  │
│  in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is    │
│  the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g.,     │
│  there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of  │
│  the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with           │
│  different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored        │
│  building materials so the structures will remain cooler.                   │
│                                                                             │

│  Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to    │
│  increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further       │
│  complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of  │
│  treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because    │
│  snow does not cover the trees as readily.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative            │
│  (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of        │
│  [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests  │
│  in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high      │
│  latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming                   │

│  Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example,         │
│  however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over                │
│  [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the  │
│  albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]).  │
│  This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and     │
│  seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].         │

│  Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming      │
│  equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values,          │
│  theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high   │
│  70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be      │
│  suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to   │
│  a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from      │
│  perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change     │
│  due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]],          │
│  &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall        │
│  albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.                           │

│  clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial     │
│  airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001               │

│  [[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere)   │

│  [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud              │

It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.\n\nHuman activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].\n\nThe &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.\n\n== Some examples of albedo effects ==\n\n=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===\n\nAccording to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.\n\n=== The tropics ===\n\nAlthough the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) year-round, which is a significant amount.\n\n=== Small scale effects ===\n\nAlbedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. \n\n=== Pine forests ===\n\nThe albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45\u00b0N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45\u00b0N].\n\n=== Urban areas ===\n\nUrban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.\n\n=== Trees ===\n\nBecause trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.\n\nStudies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].\n\n=== Snow ===\n\nSnow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.\n\nIf a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].\n\n=== Clouds ===\n\nClouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -150 \u00b0C (-240 \u00b0F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 \u00b0C (9 \u00b0F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]], &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.\n\nAlbedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1 &amp;deg;C increase in the daily temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').\n\n=== Aerosol effects ===\n\n[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].\n\n=== Black carbon ===\n\nAnother albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR_(IPCC)|SAR)]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.

'''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]].

[[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]], &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1 &amp;deg;C increase in the daily temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

=== Aerosol effects ===

[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].

=== Black carbon ===

Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR_(IPCC)|SAR)]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.
