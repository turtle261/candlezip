│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. Understanding the Task: As Predictive Compression  │
│  Intelligence, my primary goal is to minimize future token prediction       │
│  entropy. This task specifically requires finding the exact immediate       │
│  continuation (100-200 words verbatim) of a given text prefix.              │
│  Successfully locating and extracting this verbatim text will provide the   │
│  highest possible information gain, thereby maximally reducing entropy for  │
│  the subsequent tokens. The prefix and prior memory strongly suggest the    │
│  source is a Wikipedia article on "Anarchism" in an XML dump format.\n\n2.  │
│  Key Steps:\n    a. Analyze the provided text prefix: Identify the last     │
│  few words of the prefix ("Louis-Armand de L") as the key search term to    │
│  locate the exact position in the source document. Note the XML structure   │
│  and Wikipedia content.\n    b. Explore the allowed directory: Use          │
│  `directory_tree` to get an initial overview of the files within            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to identify potential source files (e.g.,   │
│  large text files, XML files, or files with "anarchism" or "wikipedia" in   │
│  their names).\n    c. Search for the exact prefix: Employ                  │
│  `search_files_content` to precisely locate the string "Louis-Armand de L"  │
│  within the files in the allowed directory. This is the most efficient way  │
│  to pinpoint the exact source and position.\n    d. Extract the             │
│  continuation: Once the file and location are identified, use               │
│  `read_text_file` or `read_file_lines` to retrieve the content immediately  │
│  following the prefix. Carefully extract 100-200 words, ensuring it\'s      │
│  verbatim.\n    e. Format the output: Present the extracted text as plain   │
│  text only, without any additional markdown, analysis, or commentary, as    │
│  per the task requirements.\n\n3. Approach to Challenges:\n    a. Locating  │
│  the correct file: The `directory_tree` will provide an initial hint. The   │
│  `search_files_content` tool is designed to overcome this by directly       │
│  finding the specific string within any file, regardless of its name or     │
│  location within the allowed directory.\n    b. Extracting verbatim text:   │
│  Once the exact match is found, I will carefully parse the surrounding      │
│  text to ensure the continuation is precise and within the specified word   │
│  count. I will pay close attention to the XML tags if the content is still  │
│  within an XML structure, to extract only the human-readable text.\n    c.  │
│  No exact source found (contingency): Although the task emphasizes finding  │
│  an exact source, if `search_files_content` fails to yield a result, I      │
│  would then resort to synthesizing a highly probable continuation based on  │
│  the extensive context provided in the prefix and prior memory, focusing    │
│  on historical figures related to anarchism. However, this is a last        │
│  resort, as the primary goal is exact matching.\n\n4. Strategic Tool        │
│  Usage:\n    a. `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`:    │
│  Initial reconnaissance to understand the file landscape.\n    b.           │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'Louis-Armand de L\')`: This is the critical tool for finding the   │
│  exact location of the prefix. I will use this first after the directory    │
│  tree.\n    c. `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')` or              │
│  `read_file_lines(path=\'<found_file_path>\', start_line=<line_number>,     │
│  end_line=<line_number + X>)`: To read the content of the identified file   │
│  and extract the continuation. The choice between these will depend on the  │
│  size of the file and the precision of the `search_files_content` result    │
│  (e.g., if it provides line numbers).\n\n5. Expected Outcome and            │
│  Alignment:\n    The expected outcome is a 100-200 word plain text          │
│  continuation that precisely follows "Louis-Armand de L" from the original  │
│  Wikipedia source. This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing  │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and     │
│  exact context, thereby allowing the language model to assign higher        │
│  probability mass to the actual upcoming tokens.\n', 'ready': True}         │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │
│  first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as               │
│  Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)                      │
│  [[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah  │
│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │
│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │
│  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of   │
│  a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]];    │
│  Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]]   │
│  (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of         │
│  value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]];   │
│  and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker       │
│  strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or     │

│  In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848. Twenty years   │
│  later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes    │
│  called the 'First International', united some diverse European             │
│  revolutionary currents including anarchism. Due to its genuine links to    │
│  active workers movements the International became signficiant.             │
│  From the start [[Karl Marx]] was a leading figure in the International:    │
│  he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association.     │
│  The first objections to Marx came from the [[Mutualism|Mutualists]] who    │
│  opposed communism and statism.  Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his  │
│  followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into    │
│  two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. The      │
│  clearest difference between the camps was over strategy. The anarchists    │
│  around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin's words) &quot;direct economical     │
│  struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political          │
│  parliamentary agitation.&quot;  At that time Marx and his followers        │
│  focused on parliamentary activity.                                         │
│  Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[authoritarian]], and predicted     │
│  that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad    │
│  as the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail       │

│  split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague          │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to      │
│  describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian                                    │

│  Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;  │
│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │
│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understanding the Task: As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my      │
│  primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy. This task     │
│  specifically requires finding the exact immediate continuation (100-200    │
│  words verbatim) of a given text prefix. Successfully locating and          │
│  extracting this verbatim text will provide the highest possible            │
│  information gain, thereby maximally reducing entropy for the subsequent    │
│  tokens. The prefix and prior memory strongly suggest the source is a       │
│  Wikipedia article on "Anarchism" in an XML dump format.                    │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      a. Analyze the provided text prefix: Identify the last few words of    │
│  the prefix ("Louis-Armand de L") as the key search term to locate the      │
│  exact position in the source document. Note the XML structure and          │
│  Wikipedia content.                                                         │
│      b. Explore the allowed directory: Use `directory_tree` to get an       │
│  initial overview of the files within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to     │
│  identify potential source files (e.g., large text files, XML files, or     │
│  files with "anarchism" or "wikipedia" in their names).                     │
│      c. Search for the exact prefix: Employ `search_files_content` to       │
│  precisely locate the string "Louis-Armand de L" within the files in the    │
│  allowed directory. This is the most efficient way to pinpoint the exact    │
│  source and position.                                                       │
│      d. Extract the continuation: Once the file and location are            │
│  identified, use `read_text_file` or `read_file_lines` to retrieve the      │
│  content immediately following the prefix. Carefully extract 100-200        │
│  words, ensuring it's verbatim.                                             │
│      e. Format the output: Present the extracted text as plain text only,   │
│  without any additional markdown, analysis, or commentary, as per the task  │
│  requirements.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach to Challenges:                                                 │
│      a. Locating the correct file: The `directory_tree` will provide an     │
│  initial hint. The `search_files_content` tool is designed to overcome      │
│  this by directly finding the specific string within any file, regardless   │
│  of its name or location within the allowed directory.                      │
│      b. Extracting verbatim text: Once the exact match is found, I will     │
│  carefully parse the surrounding text to ensure the continuation is         │
│  precise and within the specified word count. I will pay close attention    │
│  to the XML tags if the content is still within an XML structure, to        │
│  extract only the human-readable text.                                      │
│      c. No exact source found (contingency): Although the task emphasizes   │
│  finding an exact source, if `search_files_content` fails to yield a        │
│  result, I would then resort to synthesizing a highly probable              │
│  continuation based on the extensive context provided in the prefix and     │
│  prior memory, focusing on historical figures related to anarchism.         │
│  However, this is a last resort, as the primary goal is exact matching.     │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      a. `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: Initial      │
│  reconnaissance to understand the file landscape.                           │
│      b. `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',          │
│  query='Louis-Armand de L')`: This is the critical tool for finding the     │
│  exact location of the prefix. I will use this first after the directory    │
│  tree.                                                                      │
│      c. `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')` or                       │
│  `read_file_lines(path='<found_file_path>', start_line=<line_number>,       │
│  end_line=<line_number + X>)`: To read the content of the identified file   │
│  and extract the continuation. The choice between these will depend on the  │
│  size of the file and the precision of the `search_files_content` result    │
│  (e.g., if it provides line numbers).                                       │

│  5. Expected Outcome and Alignment:                                         │
│      The expected outcome is a 100-200 word plain text continuation that    │
│  precisely follows "Louis-Armand de L" from the original Wikipedia source.  │
│  This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token       │
│  prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and exact context,   │
│  thereby allowing the language model to assign higher probability mass to   │
│  the actual upcoming tokens.                                                │

│  Thought: The task requires me to find the exact immediate continuation of  │
│  the provided text prefix. The prefix appears to be from a Wikipedia XML    │
│  dump, specifically an article about "Anarchism". The last words of the     │
│  prefix are "Louis-Armand de L". My strategy is to first list the allowed   │
│  directories to confirm I can access the specified path, then use           │
│  `directory_tree` to get an overview of the files in                        │
