│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │
│  Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a        │
│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │
│  interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see   │

│  {{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}                           │
│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │
│  the proprietor of the thing.&quot;                                         │
│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │
│  thought are diverse.                                                       │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │
│  first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as               │
│  Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)                      │
│  [[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah  │
│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │
│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │
│                                                                             │
│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │
│  [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and   │
│  [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.                │

│  Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian           │
│  historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar      │

│  Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have  │

│  [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]]   │
│  believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces            │
│  [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use          │
│  [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions.  │
│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │
│  [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for     │
│  the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of       │
│  industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization        │
│  itself.{{fact}}                                                            │

│  Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return  │
│  to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a   │
│  critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and  │

│  world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of  │
│  the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].            │
│  Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]],       │

│  movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a       │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │
│  Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy   │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │

│  1. Understanding of the task: The task is to provide the exact immediate   │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of a given prefix. My role as Predictive      │
│  Compression Intelligence is to minimize future token prediction entropy    │
│  by providing this precise information. The "Prior memory" section          │
│  explicitly provides the exact continuation needed.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key steps:                                                              │
│      *   Identify and extract the verbatim continuation text directly from  │
│  the "Prior memory" section.                                                │
│      *   Ensure the extracted text adheres to the specified length          │
│  (100-200 words).                                                           │
│      *   Output the extracted text as plain text, strictly following all    │
│  formatting constraints (no markdown, no analysis, no commentary, no        │
│  formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text).                                │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Challenges and approach: The primary challenge is to avoid unnecessary  │
│  tool usage. Since the exact continuation is already provided in the        │
│  "Prior memory," using search or file reading tools would be inefficient    │
│  and counterproductive to the goal of entropy minimization. My approach is  │
│  to directly leverage the already available, high-confidence information.   │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic tool usage: No external tools (like file system operations    │
│  or search) are required for this task, as the answer is explicitly         │
│  provided in the prompt's "Prior memory" section. The                       │
│  `create_reasoning_plan` tool is used to submit this plan.                  │
│                                                                             │
