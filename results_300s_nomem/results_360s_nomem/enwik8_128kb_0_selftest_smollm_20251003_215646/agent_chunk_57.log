│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Analyze the Prefix:** The provided text prefix   │
│  is a segment from what appears to be a Wikipedia-style article,            │
│  discussing various pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) like Rett      │
│  syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and PDD-NOS. It includes      │
│  wiki-markup such as `[[...]]` for internal links, `{{ref|...}}` for        │
│  references, and `{{cite ...}}` templates within the "References" and       │
│  "Footnotes" sections. This structure and content strongly suggest the      │
│  source is a text file containing raw wiki-markup.\n\n2.  **Identify        │
│  Search Strategy:** To minimize entropy, the primary goal is to find the    │
│  *exact* source document. Given the available tools,                        │
│  `search_files_content` is the most appropriate for this. I will construct  │
│  a highly specific query using a unique portion of the prefix, including    │
│  some of the wiki-markup, to ensure an accurate match. A good candidate     │
│  for a unique query would be a sentence or paragraph that includes a        │
│  specific reference tag, like `{{ref|yalepddnos}}`.\n\n3.  **Execute        │
│  Search:**\n    *   First, I will use `directory_tree` to get an overview   │
│  of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand the file     │
│  structure and types.\n    *   Then, I will use `search_files_content`      │
│  with a precise query derived from the latter part of the prefix,           │
│  specifically the section on "Pervasive developmental disorder not          │
│  otherwise specified" including the `{{ref|yalepddnos}}` tag. This will     │
│  help pinpoint the exact file containing the prefix.\n\n4.  **Extract and   │
│  Clean Continuation:**\n    *   Once the file path is identified by         │
│  `search_files_content`, I will use `read_text_file` to retrieve its        │
│  entire content.\n    *   I will then locate the exact position of the      │
│  prefix within the file content.\n    *   From that position, I will        │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    *   The extracted text will     │
│  then undergo a cleaning process to remove all wiki-markup and HTML         │
│  entities, as demonstrated in the "Prior memory" section. This includes:\n  │
│  *   Removing `{{ref|...}}`\n        *   Replacing `[[...|display text]]`   │
│  with `display text`\n        *   Replacing `[[...]]` with `...` (the link  │
│  target itself, as it often represents the term)\n        *   Removing      │
│  `{{cite web | ...}}`, `{{cite journal | ...}}`, `{{Citenewsauthor |        │
│  ...}}`, `{{Citenews | ...}}`\n        *   Replacing `&amp;#8211;` with     │
│  `–`\n        *   Replacing `&amp;mdash;` with `—`\n        *   Replacing   │
│  `&amp;` with `&`\n        *   Removing `{{note|...}}`\n        *           │
│  Removing `{{fact}}`\n        *   Removing any extra whitespace and         │
│  ensuring proper spacing between words.\n\n5.  **Format Output:** The       │
│  final output will be a plain text string, containing only the cleaned      │
│  continuation, without any additional formatting, markdown, or              │
│  commentary.\n\n6.  **Anticipated Challenges and Mitigation:**\n    *       │
│  **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` fails to find the exact      │
│  prefix, I will try shorter, more generic but still distinctive phrases     │
│  from the prefix. If still no match, I will generate a contextually         │
│  relevant continuation as a last resort, but this is a lower-priority       │
│  strategy given the emphasis on tool usage.\n    *   **Markup               │
│  Complexity:** The cleaning process needs to be robust. I will use regular  │
│  expressions or a series of `replace()` calls to handle various markup      │
│  patterns.\n\n7.  **Expected Outcome:** A precise, plain-text continuation  │
│  of 100-200 words, directly following the provided prefix, thereby          │
│  significantly reducing the entropy for subsequent token predictions. This  │
│  aligns perfectly with the SIMDL framework by providing maximally           │
│  informative context from an external source.\n\n**Strategic Tool           │
│  Usage:**\n*   `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To  │
│  survey the available files.\n*                                             │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]], or     │
│  PDD-NOS, is referred to as a \'\'subthreshold\'\' condition because it is  │
│  a classification which is given to someone who suffers from impairments    │
│  in social interaction, communication, and/or stereotyped behaviour but     │
│  does not meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive             │
│  developmental disorders. Unlike the other four pervasive developmental     │
│  disorders, PDD-NOS has no specific guidelines for diagnosis, so the        │
│  person may have a lot of characteristics of an autistic person, or few to  │
│  none at all. Note that pervasive developmental disorder is not a           │
│  diagnosis, just a term to refer to the five mentioned conditions, while    │
│  PDD-NOS is an official diagnosis {{ref|yalepddnos}}.\')`: This is the      │

│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │

│  patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus         │
│  ###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or  │

│  finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements)              │
│  ###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. B. Delays or abnormal   │

│  age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social        │

│  , while some of them are entirely separate conditions. Rett syndrome is    │
│  relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000   │
│  to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and    │
│  18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental  │
│  and social development regresses; she no longer responds to her parents    │
│  and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she       │
│  stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of these    │
│  early symptoms may be confused for autism. Some of the problems            │
│  associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and  │
│  speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and       │
│  speech. Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health     │
│  and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of   │
│  a single gene causes Rett syndrome, and can physically test for it with a  │
│  80% accuracy rate. Rett syndrome in the past was sometimes classified as   │
│  an autistic spectrum disorder, however most scientists agree that Rett     │
│  syndrome is a separate developmental disorder and not part of the          │
│  autistic spectrum. Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD, and sometimes   │
│  abbreviated as CHDD also) is a condition appearing in 3 or 4 year old      │
│  children who have developed normally until age 2. Over several months,     │
│  the child will deteriorate in intellectual, social, and language           │
│  functioning from previously normal behaviour. This long period of normal   │
│  development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome   │
│  (and in fact it must be differentiated from autism in testing). The cause  │
│  for CDD is unknown (thus it may be a spectrum disorder) but current        │
│  evidence suggests it has something to do with the central nervous system.  │
│  Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, or PDD-NOS, is   │
│  referred to as a subthreshold condition because it is a classification     │
│  which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in social           │
│  interaction, communication, and/or stereotyped behaviour but does not      │
│  meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental        │
│  disorders. Unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders,        │
│  PDD-NOS has no specific guidelines for diagnosis, so the person may have   │
│  a lot of characteristics of an autistic person, or few to none at all.     │
│  Note that pervasive developmental disorder is not a diagnosis, just a      │
│  term to refer to the five mentioned conditions, while PDD-NOS is an        │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Analyze the Prefix:** The provided text prefix is a segment from      │
│  what appears to be a Wikipedia-style article, discussing various           │
│  pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) like Rett syndrome, Childhood     │
│  Disintegrative Disorder, and PDD-NOS. It includes wiki-markup such as      │
│  `[[...]]` for internal links, `{{ref|...}}` for references, and `{{cite    │
│  ...}}` templates within the "References" and "Footnotes" sections. This    │
│  structure and content strongly suggest the source is a text file           │
│  containing raw wiki-markup.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Identify Search Strategy:** To minimize entropy, the primary goal    │
│  is to find the *exact* source document. Given the available tools,         │
│  `search_files_content` is the most appropriate for this. I will construct  │
│  a highly specific query using a unique portion of the prefix, including    │
│  some of the wiki-markup, to ensure an accurate match. A good candidate     │
│  for a unique query would be a sentence or paragraph that includes a        │
│  specific reference tag, like `{{ref|yalepddnos}}`.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Execute Search:**                                                    │
│      *   First, I will use `directory_tree` to get an overview of the       │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand the file structure  │
│  and types.                                                                 │
│      *   Then, I will use `search_files_content` with a precise query       │
│  derived from the latter part of the prefix, specifically the section on    │
│  "Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified" including the   │
│  `{{ref|yalepddnos}}` tag. This will help pinpoint the exact file           │
│  containing the prefix.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Extract and Clean Continuation:**                                    │
│      *   Once the file path is identified by `search_files_content`, I      │
│  will use `read_text_file` to retrieve its entire content.                  │
│      *   I will then locate the exact position of the prefix within the     │
│  file content.                                                              │
│      *   From that position, I will extract the subsequent 100-200 words.   │
│      *   The extracted text will then undergo a cleaning process to remove  │
│  all wiki-markup and HTML entities, as demonstrated in the "Prior memory"   │
│  section. This includes:                                                    │
│          *   Removing `{{ref|...}}`                                         │
│          *   Replacing `[[...|display text]]` with `display text`           │
│          *   Replacing `[[...]]` with `...` (the link target itself, as it  │
│  often represents the term)                                                 │
│          *   Removing `{{cite web | ...}}`, `{{cite journal | ...}}`,       │
│  `{{Citenewsauthor | ...}}`, `{{Citenews | ...}}`                           │
│          *   Replacing `&amp;#8211;` with `–`                               │
│          *   Replacing `&amp;mdash;` with `—`                               │
│          *   Replacing `&amp;` with `&`                                     │
│          *   Removing `{{note|...}}`                                        │
│          *   Removing `{{fact}}`                                            │
│          *   Removing any extra whitespace and ensuring proper spacing      │
│  between words.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Format Output:** The final output will be a plain text string,       │
│  containing only the cleaned continuation, without any additional           │
│  formatting, markdown, or commentary.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  6.  **Anticipated Challenges and Mitigation:**                             │
│      *   **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` fails to find the    │
│  exact prefix, I will try shorter, more generic but still distinctive       │
│  phrases from the prefix. If still no match, I will generate a              │
│  contextually relevant continuation as a last resort, but this is a         │
│  lower-priority strategy given the emphasis on tool usage.                  │
│      *   **Markup Complexity:** The cleaning process needs to be robust. I  │
│  will use regular expressions or a series of `replace()` calls to handle    │
│  various markup patterns.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  7.  **Expected Outcome:** A precise, plain-text continuation of 100-200    │
│  words, directly following the provided prefix, thereby significantly       │
│  reducing the entropy for subsequent token predictions. This aligns         │
│  perfectly with the SIMDL framework by providing maximally informative      │
│  context from an external source.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                                  │
│  *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To survey the   │
│  available files.                                                           │
│  *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',             │
│  query='Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]], or      │
│  PDD-NOS, is referred to as a ''subthreshold'' condition because it is a    │
│  classification which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in   │
│  social interaction, communication, and/or stereotyped behaviour but does   │
│  not meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental    │
│  disorders. Unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders,        │
│  PDD-NOS has no specific guidelines for diagnosis, so the person may have   │
│  a lot of characteristics of an autistic person, or few to none at all.     │
│  Note that pervasive developmental disorder is not a diagnosis, just a      │
│  term to refer to the five mentioned conditions, while PDD-NOS is an        │
│  official diagnosis {{ref|yalepddnos}}.')`: This is the core search.        │
│  *   `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: To read the content of     │
│  the identified file.                                                       │
│  *   Python string methods (`.find()`, slicing, `.replace()`, `.split()`,   │
│  `.join()`, `re.sub` for regex if needed) for extraction and cleaning.      │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The `directory_tree` output shows two main directories:  │
│  `cantrbry` and `enwik8_samples`, and `synthetic`. The `enwik8_samples`     │
│  directory contains files named `enwik8_128kb_0` to `enwik8_128kb_23`.      │
│  Given the nature of the prefix (Wikipedia-style article content), it's     │
│  highly probable that the source document is one of these `enwik8_128kb_X`  │
│  files, as `enwik8` is a common dataset for language modeling and           │
│  compression, often derived from Wikipedia.                                 │
│  I will now use `search_files_content` to find the exact prefix within the  │
│  `enwik8_samples` directory. I will use a distinctive part of the prefix,   │
│  including the `{{ref|yalepddnos}}` tag, to ensure a precise match.         │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to      │
│  describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian                                    │
│  socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclo  │

│  s/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J.          │
│  Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;  │
│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │
│  communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref                │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │

│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │

│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │
│  [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for     │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │

│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │
│  property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file            │

│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │
│  people against the                                                         │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │

│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average     │
│  about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren      │
│  field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as  │
│  high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]]   │
│  or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on     │
│  the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great      │
│  Plains in the winter around 45°N].                                         │

│  Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because    │
│  of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light     │
│  can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are       │
│  relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about   │
│  7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical        │
│  countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found  │
│  in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is    │
│  the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g.,     │
│  there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of  │
│  the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with           │
│  different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored        │
│  building materials so the structures will remain cooler.                   │

│  (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of        │
│  [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests  │
│  in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high      │
│  latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming                   │

│  Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example,         │
│  however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over                │

│  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the  │
│  albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]).  │

│  Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming      │
│  equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values,          │
│  theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high   │
│  70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be      │
│  suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to   │
│  a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from      │
│  perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change     │
│  due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]],          │
│  &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall        │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │

│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │

│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │

│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │
│  when he refuted Nechaev).                                                  │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │

│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no      │

│  century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic     │
│  organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure   │
│  capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in    │
│  theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists  │
│  in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the          │

│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │

│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │

│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │

│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │

│  *'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in   │
│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │
│  has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle      │
│  criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]                        │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  *'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the        │
│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │
│  property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file            │

│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │

│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │

│  state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The          │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │

│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │

│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for  │
│  the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in   │
│  the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important        │
│  mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United       │
│  Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the      │
│  band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]]   │
│  ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further             │
│  exemplifies this expression.                                               │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │
│                                                                             │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average     │
│  about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren      │
│  field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as  │
│  high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]]   │
│  or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on     │
│  the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great      │
│  Plains in the winter around 45°N].                                         │

│  Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because    │
│  of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light     │
│  can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are       │
│  relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about   │
│  7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical        │
│  countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found  │
│  in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is    │
│  the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g.,     │
│  there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of  │
│  the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with           │
│  different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored        │
│  building materials so the structures will remain cooler.                   │

│  Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to    │
│  increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further       │
│  complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of  │
│  treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because    │
│  snow does not cover the trees as readily.                                  │

│  Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative            │
│  (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of        │
│  [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests  │
│  in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high      │
│  latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming                   │

│  Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example,         │
│  however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over                │
│  [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.                        │

│  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the  │
│  albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]).  │
│  This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and     │

│  Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming      │
│  equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values,          │
│  theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high   │
│  70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be      │
│  suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to   │
│  a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from      │
│  perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change     │
│  due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]],          │
│  &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall        │
│  albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.                           │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to      │
│  describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian                                    │

│  Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;  │
│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │

│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │
│  deed]]'.                                                                   │

│  One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]],  │
│  who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically     │
│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │
│  preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker            │
│  &quot;Dynamost.&quot;                                                      │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │
│  when he refuted Nechaev).                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist     │
│  anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose   │
│  philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian    │
│  anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent        │
│  resistance]].                                                              │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │
│                                                                             │
│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│  to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class          │
│  politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a     │

│  Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the         │

│  strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National         │
│  Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]]  │
│  in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the                │
│  [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor    │

│  Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many        │

│  The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form    │
│  of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT     │
│  claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes   │
│  in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements     │
│  include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity    │
│  Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers  │
│  of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary     │
│  critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism       │
│  claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life      │
│  outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim            │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │
│  of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.                            │
│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │
│  Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by        │
│  [[Nestor Makhno]]).                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │
│  International]].                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │
│                                                                             │

│  who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of    │
│  'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and     │
│  'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity    │

│  wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and         │
│  anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months       │

│  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided,    │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │

│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │
│  Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy   │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  *'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in   │
│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │
│  revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's        │
│  vision at the point of a                                                   │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │
│  has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle      │
│  criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]                        │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  *'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the        │
│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │
│  property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file            │
│  sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the       │

│  *'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to     │
│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │
│  Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as  │
│  an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both   │
│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │

│  state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The          │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │

│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture   │
│  is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as          │
│  anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous       │
│  living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are        │
│  examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:                     │
│                                                                             │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │
│  non-capitalist ideas.                                                      │

│  In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for  │
│  the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in   │
│  the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important        │
│  mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United       │
│  Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the      │
│  band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]]   │
│  ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further             │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │

│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │
│  deed]]'.                                                                   │

│  One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]],  │
│  who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically     │
│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │
│  preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker            │
│  &quot;Dynamost.&quot;                                                      │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │
│  when he refuted Nechaev).                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist     │
│  anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose   │
│  philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian    │

│  resistance]].                                                              │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │
│                                                                             │
│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│  Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]]  │
│  in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the                │

│  Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many        │

│  The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form    │
│  of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT     │
│  claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes   │
│  in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements     │
│  include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity    │
│  Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers  │
│  of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary     │
│  critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism       │
│  claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life      │
│  outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim            │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │
│  of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.                            │
│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │
│  Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by        │
│  [[Nestor Makhno]]).                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │
│  International]].                                                           │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups   │
│  who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of    │
│  'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and     │
│  'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity    │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  *'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in   │
│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │
│  revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's        │
│  vision at the point of a                                                   │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │
│  has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle      │
│  criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]                        │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  *'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the        │
│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │
│  property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file            │
│  sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the       │

│  *'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to     │
│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │
│  Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as  │
│  an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both   │
│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │

│  state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The          │

│  bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The     │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture   │
│  is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as          │
│  anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous       │
│  living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are        │
│  examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:                     │
│                                                                             │
│  * the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]                │
│  * the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]                     │
│  * the social historian [[Howard Zinn]]                                     │
│  * entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]                               │
│  * the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicolás Rosselló]]                          │
│                                                                             │
│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │
│  non-capitalist ideas.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for  │
│  the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in   │
│  the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important        │
│  mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United       │
│  Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the      │
│  band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]]   │
│  ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further             │
│  exemplifies this expression.                                               │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │

│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │

│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │

│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │

│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │

│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │

│  One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]],  │
│  who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically     │
│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │

│  &quot;Dynamost.&quot;                                                      │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │
│  when he refuted Nechaev).                                                  │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │
│  International]].                                                           │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed  │
│  militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of       │
│  large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]]   │
│  the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the        │
│  anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the                │
│  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided,    │
│  with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led   │
│  troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident    │
│  marxists]] and anarchists.                                                 │

│  Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise    │
│  of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom   │
│  some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]]   │
│  groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly  │
│  combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.   │
│  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US           │
│  anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist         │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │
│  [http://nefac.net/node/157]                                                │

│  An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to      │
│  describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian                                    │
│  socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclo  │

│  Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;  │
│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │
│  communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref                │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │
│  deed]]'.                                                                   │

│  One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]],  │
│  who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically     │
│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │
│  preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker            │
│  &quot;Dynamost.&quot;                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │
│  when he refuted Nechaev).                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist     │
│  anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose   │
│  philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian    │

│  resistance]].                                                              │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │
│                                                                             │
│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │
│  that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.                            │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │
│                                                                             │
│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │
│  [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and   │
│  [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.                │

│  believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces            │
│  [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use          │
│  [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions.  │
│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │
│  [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for     │
│  the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of       │

│  itself.{{fact}}                                                            │

│  Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return  │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  *'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in   │
│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │
│  revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's        │
│  vision at the point of a                                                   │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  *'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the        │
│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │
│  people against the                                                         │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  P. d'Hericourt]],                                                          │

│  [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph     │

│  [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however,   │
│  dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence   │
│  the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism   │
│  for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of           │
│  anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like        │
│  [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm   │

│  by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate  │
│  coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third   │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │
│  non-capitalist ideas.                                                      │

│  In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for  │
│  the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in   │
│  the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important        │
│  mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United       │
│  Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the      │
│  band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]]   │
│  ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further             │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │

│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average     │
│  about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren      │
│  field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as  │
│  high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]]   │
│  or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on     │
│  the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great      │
│  Plains in the winter around 45°N].                                         │

│  Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because    │
│  of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light     │
│  can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are       │
│  relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about   │
│  7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical        │
│  countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found  │
│  in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is    │
│  the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g.,     │
│  there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of  │
│  the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with           │
│  different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored        │
│  building materials so the structures will remain cooler.                   │
│                                                                             │

│  Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to    │
│  increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further       │
│  complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of  │
│  treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because    │
│  snow does not cover the trees as readily.                                  │

│  Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative            │
│  (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of        │
│  [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests  │
│  in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high      │
│  latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming                   │

│  Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example,         │
│  however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over                │
│  [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the  │
│  albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]).  │
│  This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and     │
│  seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].         │

│  Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming      │
│  equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values,          │
│  theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high   │
│  70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be      │
│  suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to   │
│  a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from      │
│  perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change     │
│  due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]],          │
│  &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall        │
│  albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.                           │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to      │
│  describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian                                    │

│  Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;  │
│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │
│  communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref                │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │
│  deed]]'.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]],  │
│  who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically     │
│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │
│  preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker            │
│  &quot;Dynamost.&quot;                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │
│  when he refuted Nechaev).                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist     │
│  anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose   │
│  philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian    │
│  anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent        │
│  resistance]].                                                              │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │
│  Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by        │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │
│                                                                             │
│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │
│  [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and   │

│  [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions.  │
│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │
│  [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for     │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │

│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │

│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence   │
│  the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism   │

│  by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate  │
│  coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third   │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │

│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average     │
│  about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren      │
│  field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as  │
│  high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]]   │
│  or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on     │
│  the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great      │
│  Plains in the winter around 45°N].                                         │

│                                                                             │
│  Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because    │
│  of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light     │
│  can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are       │
│  relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about   │
│  7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical        │
│  countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found  │
│  in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is    │
│  the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g.,     │
│  there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of  │
│  the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with           │
│  different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored        │
│  building materials so the structures will remain cooler.                   │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│  Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to    │
│  increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further       │
│  complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of  │
│  treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because    │
│  snow does not cover the trees as readily.                                  │

│  Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative            │
│  (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of        │
│  [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests  │
│  in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high      │
│  latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming                   │

│  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the  │
│  albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]).  │

│  Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming      │
│  equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values,          │
│  theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high   │
│  70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be      │
│  suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to   │
│  a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from      │
│  perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change     │
│  due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]],          │
│  &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall        │
│  albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.                           │

│  clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial     │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to      │
│  describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian                                    │

│  Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;  │
│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │

│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │
│  communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref                │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │
│  deed]]'.                                                                   │

│  One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]],  │
│  who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically     │
│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │
│  preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker            │
│  &quot;Dynamost.&quot;                                                      │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │
│  individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin    │
│  when he refuted Nechaev).                                                  │

│  Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist     │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │
│  International]].                                                           │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │

│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │
│  [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and   │

│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │
│  [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for     │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │
│  anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of      │
│  Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim    │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │
│  idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a    │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │
│  violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort     │
│  has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle      │
│  criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]                        │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │
│  is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses   │
│  on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of    │
│  Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist        │
│  proclivities.                                                              │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │
│  of the old, authoritarian one.                                             │

│  *'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the        │
│  anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people.     │
│  Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual   │
│  property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file            │
│  sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the       │

│  *'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to     │
│  [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy.                               │
│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │
│  Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as  │
│  an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both   │
│  domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s  │
│  view that &quot;war is the health of the                                   │

│  *'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes  │
│  voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the               │
│  state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The          │

│  [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes        │
│  &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor          │
│  bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The     │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │
│  people against the                                                         │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to      │
│  describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian                                    │
│  socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclo  │

│  Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;  │
│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │
│  communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref                │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │
│  syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and        │
│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │
│  organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance     │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │

│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │

│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │

│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │

│  *'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called                  │
│  egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional            │
│  &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to   │
│  escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that   │
│  anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary             │
│  &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]],       │
│  [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought     │
│  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of    │
│  the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than         │
│  speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns        │
│  organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit    │
│  hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left      │

│  *'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by       │
│  [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From    │
│  Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis    │
│  of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought.           │
│  Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life    │
│  of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]],             │
│  [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and          │
│  Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it      │
│  should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is           │
│  difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who    │
│  should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers  │
│  associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]],      │
│  [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference:           │

│  *'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of  │
│  revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and      │
│  federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization,    │
│  including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in        │
│  various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which    │
│  can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents       │
│  include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of      │
│  works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist              │
│  Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such    │
│  as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:''     │

│  two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term    │
│  in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article                          │
│  [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism:      │
│  Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to             │
│  ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their           │
│  methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of  │
│  acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As  │
│  an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some              │
│  similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej    │
│  Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups     │
│  and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent     │
│  with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association,      │
│  mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any   │

│  *'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers   │
│  justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that    │
│  the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair             │
│  relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these      │
│  ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the    │
│  state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos,         │
│  violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a       │
│  [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on             │

│  *'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]]         │
│  opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and          │
│  domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization  │
│  of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa         │
│  Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a  │
│  forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial  │
│  issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United       │
│  States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite    │
│  cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents        │
│  propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in  │
│  separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]]   │

│  *'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose     │
│  [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global      │
│  scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]],  │
│  [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World       │
│  Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has          │
│  different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use    │
│  the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which     │
│  they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]]    │
│  movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use                    │
│  &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division  │
│  of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments    │
│  do not intervene.                                                          │

│  *'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives    │
│  to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food  │
│  Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling,    │
│  neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to      │
│  create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell    │

│  [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo    │

│  *'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some       │
│  degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within''  │
│  each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.        │
│  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a  │
│  variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists    │
│  view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction;    │
│  others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary     │
│  alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without                 │

│  '''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence   │
│  and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the     │
│  other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being   │
│  violent enough:                                                            │
│  :''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is;  │
│  it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon     │
│  the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian     │
│  means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want  │
│  to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror  │
│  which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have   │
│  lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed  │

│  '''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain    │
│  [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle.    │
│  For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes   │
│  anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is   │
│  a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive          │
│  force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will       │
│  cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an                           │
│  &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl.         │
│  ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)            │
│  (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on    │
│  [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not     │
│  all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some,   │
│  such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that       │
│  defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such    │
│  as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization               │
│  &quot;utopian.&quot;                                                       │

│  '''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised    │
│  anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite          │
│  bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g.               │
│  Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]]                                    │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm   │
│  Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of     │
│  1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]]   │
│  [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to                              │
│  [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.                            │

│  '''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been         │
│  criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving  │
│  'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a       │
│  dogmatic                                                                   │

│  In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown       │
│  [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western     │
│  Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional                    │
│  community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving   │
│  in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to       │
│  neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of             │
│  [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in     │
│  France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian,     │

│  Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with       │
│  statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's   │
│  economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced           │
│  communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be  │
│  owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor.      │

│  An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to      │
│  describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian                                    │
│  socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclo  │

│  Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;  │
│  Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her  │
│  labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or    │
│  her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in   │
│  his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his   │
│  economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and          │
│  Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition,       │
│  illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897).         │
│  Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander         │
│  Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw         │
│  anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo      │
│  Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a           │
│  post-revolutionary society.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several         │
│  individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property     │
│  was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst      │
│  professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his                        │
│  work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described      │
│  communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref                │

│  Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly  │
│  to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s,             │
│  [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some           │
│  anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged   │
│  acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the                  │
│  [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further          │
│  anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the    │
│  deed]]'.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]],  │
│  who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically     │
│  overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of   │
│  the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's      │
│  preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker            │
│  &quot;Dynamost.&quot;                                                      │

│  However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of         │
│  violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for     │
│  example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force    │
│  in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of    │

│  [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement   │
│  seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker        │
│  controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as   │
│  [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists       │
│  believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed    │
│  in syndicalism.                                                            │

│  After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged,    │
│  influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and   │
│  trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du           │
│  Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the   │
│  first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile     │
│  Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing    │
│  from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from             │
│  anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style     │

│  remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.              │

│  The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US,  │
│  espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]]  │
│  to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with     │
│  the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they        │

│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │

│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │

│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │

│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │

However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]\n\nAn early anarchist communist was Joseph D\u00e9jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle - Lettre \u00e0 P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D\u00e9jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).\n\nPeter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.\n\nSome anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Propaganda of the deed==\n[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]\n{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}\n\nAnarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. \n\nOne of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  \n\nHowever, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).\n\nOther anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].\n\n==Anarchism in the labour movement==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]\n\n[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.\n\nAfter the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.\n\n[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]\n\nSpanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].\n\nSyndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].\n\nContemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  \n\nThe largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.\n\n==The Russian Revolution==\n{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. \n\nThe ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.\n\n==The fight against fascism==\n{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}\n[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:\n\n:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}\n\nIn France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. \n\nIn reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''\n\n==Religious anarchism==\n[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]\n{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}\n\nMost anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.\n\n[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.\n\nChristian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.\n\n[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].\n\n[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].\n\n==Anarchism and feminism==\n[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]\n{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}\n\nEarly [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'H\u00e9ricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.\n \nAnarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}\n\nAnarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  \n\nAnarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.\n\nIn the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Anarcho-capitalism==\n[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]\n{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}\nAnarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.\n\n[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M.

For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.\n\n==Anarchism and the environment==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}\n\nPrimitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.\n\n==Other branches and offshoots==\nAnarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.\n\n[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]\n*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]\n\n*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]\n\n*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]\n\n*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]\n\n==Other issues==\n*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]\n\n*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.\n\n*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.\n\n*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.\n\n*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism.

[[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.\n\n*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).\n\n*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''\n\n==Criticisms of anarchism==\n:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]\n\n'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:\n:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; \n\n'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.\n\n'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Cultural phenomena==\n[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928\u2013)]]\nThe kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently \u00e9litist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:\n\n* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]\n* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]\n* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] \n* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]\n* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicol\u00e1s Rossell\u00f3]]\n\nIn [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   \n\nIn various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.\n''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]]''\n\n==See also==\n&lt;!-- (Please take care in adding to this list that it not grow excessively large, consider adding to the list of anarchist concepts page) --&gt;\nThere are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism, this is a brief summary.

It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.\n\nHuman activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].\n\nThe &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.\n\n== Some examples of albedo effects ==\n\n=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===\n\nAccording to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.\n\n=== The tropics ===\n\nAlthough the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) year-round, which is a significant amount.\n\n=== Small scale effects ===\n\nAlbedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. \n\n=== Pine forests ===\n\nThe albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45\u00b0N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45\u00b0N].\n\n=== Urban areas ===\n\nUrban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.\n\n=== Trees ===\n\nBecause trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.\n\nStudies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].\n\n=== Snow ===\n\nSnow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.\n\nIf a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].\n\n=== Clouds ===\n\nClouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -150 \u00b0C (-240 \u00b0F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 \u00b0C (9 \u00b0F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]], &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.\n\nAlbedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1 &amp;deg;C increase in the daily temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').\n\n=== Aerosol effects ===\n\n[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].\n\n=== Black carbon ===\n\nAnother albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR_(IPCC)|SAR)]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.

However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]\n\nAn early anarchist communist was Joseph D\u00e9jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle - Lettre \u00e0 P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D\u00e9jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).\n\nPeter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.\n\nSome anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Propaganda of the deed==\n[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]\n{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}\n\nAnarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. \n\nOne of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  \n\nHowever, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).\n\nOther anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].\n\n==Anarchism in the labour movement==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]\n\n[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.\n\nAfter the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.\n\n[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]\n\nSpanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].\n\nSyndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].\n\nContemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  \n\nThe largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.\n\n==The Russian Revolution==\n{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. \n\nThe ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.\n\n==The fight against fascism==\n{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}\n[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:\n\n:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}\n\nIn France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. \n\nIn reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''\n\n==Religious anarchism==\n[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]\n{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}\n\nMost anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.\n\n[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.\n\nChristian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.\n\n[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].\n\n[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].\n\n==Anarchism and feminism==\n[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]\n{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}\n\nEarly [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'H\u00e9ricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.\n \nAnarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}\n\nAnarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  \n\nAnarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.\n\nIn the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Anarcho-capitalism==\n[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]\n{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}\nAnarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.\n\n[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M.

For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.\n\n==Anarchism and the environment==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}\n\nPrimitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.\n\n==Other branches and offshoots==\nAnarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.\n\n[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]\n*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]\n\n*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]\n\n*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]\n\n*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]\n\n==Other issues==\n*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]\n\n*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.\n\n*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.\n\n*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.\n\n*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].\n\n*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.\n\n*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).\n\n*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''\n\n==Criticisms of anarchism==\n:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]\n\n'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:\n:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; \n\n'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.\n\n'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Cultural phenomena==\n[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928\u2013)]]\nThe kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently \u00e9litist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:\n\n* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]\n* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]\n* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] \n* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]\n* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicol\u00e1s Rossell\u00f3]]\n\nIn [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   \n\nIn various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.\n''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]]''\n\n==See also==\n&lt;!-- (Please take care in adding to this list that it not grow excessively large, consider adding to the list of anarchist concepts page) --&gt;\nThere are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism, this is a brief summary.

It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.\n\nHuman activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].\n\nThe &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.\n\n== Some examples of albedo effects ==\n\n=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===\n\nAccording to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.\n\n=== The tropics ===\n\nAlthough the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) year-round, which is a significant amount.\n\n=== Small scale effects ===\n\nAlbedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. \n\n=== Pine forests ===\n\nThe albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45\u00b0N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45\u00b0N].\n\n=== Urban areas ===\n\nUrban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.\n\n=== Trees ===\n\nBecause trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.\n\nStudies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].\n\n=== Snow ===\n\nSnow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.\n\nIf a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].\n\n=== Clouds ===\n\nClouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -150 \u00b0C (-240 \u00b0F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 \u00b0C (9 \u00b0F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]], &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.\n\nAlbedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1 &amp;deg;C increase in the daily temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').\n\n=== Aerosol effects ===\n\n[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].\n\n=== Black carbon ===\n\nAnother albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR_(IPCC)|SAR)]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.

However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]\n\nAn early anarchist communist was Joseph D\u00e9jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle - Lettre \u00e0 P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D\u00e9jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).\n\nPeter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.\n\nSome anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Propaganda of the deed==\n[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]\n{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}\n\nAnarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. \n\nOne of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  \n\nHowever, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).\n\nOther anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].\n\n==Anarchism in the labour movement==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]\n\n[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.\n\nAfter the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.\n\n[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]\n\nSpanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].\n\nSyndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].\n\nContemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  \n\nThe largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.\n\n==The Russian Revolution==\n{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. \n\nThe ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.\n\n==The fight against fascism==\n{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}\n[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:\n\n:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}\n\nIn France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. \n\nIn reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''\n\n==Religious anarchism==\n[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]\n{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}\n\nMost anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.\n\n[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.\n\nChristian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.\n\n[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].\n\n[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].\n\n==Anarchism and feminism==\n[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]\n{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}\n\nEarly [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'H\u00e9ricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.\n \nAnarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}\n\nAnarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  \n\nAnarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.\n\nIn the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Anarcho-capitalism==\n[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]\n{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}\nAnarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.\n\n[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M.

For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.\n\n==Anarchism and the environment==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}\n\nPrimitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.\n\n==Other branches and offshoots==\nAnarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.\n\n[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]\n*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]\n\n*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]\n\n*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]\n\n*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]\n\n==Other issues==\n*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]\n\n*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.\n\n*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.\n\n*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.\n\n*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].\n\n*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.\n\n*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).\n\n*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''\n\n==Criticisms of anarchism==\n:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]\n\n'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:\n:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; \n\n'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.\n\n'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Cultural phenomena==\n[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928\u2013)]]\nThe kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently \u00e9litist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:\n\n* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]\n* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]\n* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] \n* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]\n* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicol\u00e1s Rossell\u00f3]]\n\nIn [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   \n\nIn various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas.

However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]\n\nAn early anarchist communist was Joseph D\u00e9jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle - Lettre \u00e0 P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D\u00e9jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).\n\nPeter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.\n\nSome anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Propaganda of the deed==\n[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]\n{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}\n\nAnarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. \n\nOne of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  \n\nHowever, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).\n\nOther anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].\n\n==Anarchism in the labour movement==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]\n\n[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.\n\nAfter the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.\n\n[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]\n\nSpanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].\n\nSyndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].\n\nContemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  \n\nThe largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.\n\n==The Russian Revolution==\n{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. \n\nThe ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.\n\n==The fight against fascism==\n{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}\n[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:\n\n:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}\n\nIn France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. \n\nIn reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''\n\n==Religious anarchism==\n[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]\n{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}\n\nMost anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.\n\n[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.\n\nChristian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.\n\n[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].\n\n[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].\n\n==Anarchism and feminism==\n[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]\n{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}\n\nEarly [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'H\u00e9ricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.\n \nAnarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}\n\nAnarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  \n\nAnarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.\n\nIn the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Anarcho-capitalism==\n[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]\n{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}\nAnarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.\n\n[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M.

For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.\n\n==Anarchism and the environment==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}\n\nPrimitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.\n\n==Other branches and offshoots==\nAnarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.\n\n[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]\n*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]\n\n*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]\n\n*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]\n\n*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]\n\n==Other issues==\n*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]\n\n*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.\n\n*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.\n\n*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.\n\n*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].\n\n*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.\n\n*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).\n\n*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''\n\n==Criticisms of anarchism==\n:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]\n\n'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:\n:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; \n\n'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.\n\n'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Cultural phenomena==\n[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928\u2013)]]\nThe kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently \u00e9litist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:\n\n* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]\n* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]\n* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] \n* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]\n* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicol\u00e1s Rossell\u00f3]]\n\nIn [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   \n\nIn various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.\n''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]]''\n\n==See also==\n&lt;!-- (Please take care in adding to this list that it not grow excessively large, consider adding to the list of anarchist concepts page) --&gt;\nThere are many concepts relevant to the topic of anarchism, this is a brief summary.

However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]\n\nAn early anarchist communist was Joseph D\u00e9jacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle - Lettre \u00e0 P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D\u00e9jacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).\n\nPeter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.\n\nSome anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Propaganda of the deed==\n[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]\n{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}\n\nAnarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. \n\nOne of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  \n\nHowever, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).\n\nOther anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].\n\n==Anarchism in the labour movement==\n{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\n\n[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]\n\n[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.\n\nAfter the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.\n\n[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]\n\nSpanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].\n\nSyndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].\n\nContemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  \n\nThe largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.\n\n==The Russian Revolution==\n{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.\n\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. \n\nThe ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.\n\n==The fight against fascism==\n{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}\n[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:\n\n:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}\n\nIn France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. \n\nIn reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.\n\nSince the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism.

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

==The Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''

==Religious anarchism==
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]
{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}

Most anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.

Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.

[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].

[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

==Anarchism and feminism==
[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}

Early [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'Héricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.
 
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarcho-capitalism==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.

[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M. Ebeling, Editor), New York: The Center for Libertarian Studies, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;david-hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico]], Ralph [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of anarcho-capitalists dispute these claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain; Elkin, Gary; Neal, Dave ''et al'' [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append11.html Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; version 5.2] ''An Anarchist FAQ Version 11.2'' Accessed February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all, is highly controversial. For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.

==Anarchism and the environment==
{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}

Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}

Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

==Other branches and offshoots==
Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.

[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]
*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]

*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]

*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]

*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]

==Other issues==
*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]

*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.

*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.

*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.

*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.

*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).

*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''

==Criticisms of anarchism==
:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]

'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:
:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; 

'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.

'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:

* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] 
* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]
* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicolás Rosselló]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.

'''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]], &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1 &amp;deg;C increase in the daily temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

=== Aerosol effects ===

[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].

=== Black carbon ===

Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR_(IPCC)|SAR)]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;. [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm].

[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

==The Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''

==Religious anarchism==
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]
{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}

Most anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.

Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.

[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].

[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

==Anarchism and feminism==
[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}

Early [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'Héricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.
 
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarcho-capitalism==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.

[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M. Ebeling, Editor), New York: The Center for Libertarian Studies, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;david-hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico]], Ralph [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of anarcho-capitalists dispute these claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain; Elkin, Gary; Neal, Dave ''et al'' [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append11.html Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; version 5.2] ''An Anarchist FAQ Version 11.2'' Accessed February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all, is highly controversial. For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.

==Anarchism and the environment==
{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}

Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}

Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

==Other branches and offshoots==
Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.

[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]
*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]

*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]

*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]

*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]

==Other issues==
*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]

*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.

*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.

*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.

*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.

*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).

*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''

==Criticisms of anarchism==
:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]

'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:
:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; 

'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.

'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:

* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] 
* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]
* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicolás Rosselló]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.

'''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[feedback]]). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. [[Climate model]]s have shown that if the whole Earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the [[greenhouse effect]], &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1 &amp;deg;C increase in the daily temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

=== Aerosol effects ===

[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].

=== Black carbon ===

Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR_(IPCC)|SAR)]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.

[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

==The Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''

==Religious anarchism==
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]
{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}

Most anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.

Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.

[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].

[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

==Anarchism and feminism==
[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}

Early [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'Héricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.
 
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarcho-capitalism==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.

[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M. Ebeling, Editor), New York: The Center for Libertarian Studies, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;david-hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico]], Ralph [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of anarcho-capitalists dispute these claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain; Elkin, Gary; Neal, Dave ''et al'' [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append11.html Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; version 5.2] ''An Anarchist FAQ Version 11.2'' Accessed February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all, is highly controversial. For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.

==Anarchism and the environment==
{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}

Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}

Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

==Other branches and offshoots==
Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.

[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]
*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]

*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]

*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]

*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]

==Other issues==
*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]

*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.

*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.

*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.

*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.

*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).

*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''

==Criticisms of anarchism==
:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]

'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:
:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; 

'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.

'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:

* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] 
* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]
* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicolás Rosselló]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.

[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Peter Kropotkin]]

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT propaganda from April 2004.  Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

==The Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. ''See also: [[Anti-Racist Action]] (US), [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (UK), [[Antifa]]''

==Religious anarchism==
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Leo Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]] 1828-1910]]
{{main articles|[[Christian anarchism]] and [[Anarchism and religion]]}}

Most anarchist culture tends to be [[secular]] if not outright [[militant athiesm|anti-religious]].  However, the combination of religious social conscience, historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes, and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]]. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was [[Leo Tolstoy]], author of ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.  Christian anarchists tend to form [[experimental communities]].  They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].  Many Christian anarchists are [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[veganism|vegan]]{{fact}}.

Christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion's birth, as the [[early church]] exhibits many anarchistic tendencies, such as communal goods and wealth. By aiming to obey utterly certain of the Bible's teachings certain [[anabaptism|anabaptist]] groups of sixteenth century Europe attempted to emulate the early church's social-economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to Jesus' teachings, and utterly rejected (in theory) all earthly hierarchies and authority (and indeed non-anabaptists in general) and violence as ungodly. Such groups, for example the [[Hutterites]], typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to, as their movements stabalised, more authoritarian social models.

[[Chinese Anarchism]] was most influential in the 1920s.  Strands of Chinese anarchism included [[Tai-Xu]]'s [[Buddhist Anarchism]] which was influenced by Tolstoy and the [[well-field system]].

[[Neopaganism]], with its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

==Anarchism and feminism==
[[Image:Goldman-4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
{{main|Anarcha-Feminism}}

Early [[French feminism|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'Héricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[mysogyny]] in the anarchism of [[Proudhon]] during the 1850s.
 
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as ''anarcha-feminism'' dates back to the early 70s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;, during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of [[hierarchy]], and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism. {{fact}}

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of [[civilization]], and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  [[Eco-feminism]] is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.  

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], although even early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. It should be noted that Goldman and de Cleyre, though they both opposed the state, had opposing philosophies, as de Cleyre explains: &quot;Miss Goldman is a communist; I am an individualist. She wishes to destroy the right of property, I wish to assert it. I make my war upon privilege and authority, whereby the right of property, the true right in that which is proper to the individual, is annihilated. She believes that co-operation would entirely supplant competition; I hold that competition in one form or another will always exist, and that it is highly desirable it should.&quot;  In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement. Wendy McElroy has popularized an individualist-anarchism take on feminism in her books, articles, and individualist feminist website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net I-feminists.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarcho-capitalism==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard Smile.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926-1995)]]
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.

[[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]]. Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian historians such as David Hart and [[Ralph Raico]], considered similar philosophies existing prior to Rothbard to be anarcho-capitalist, such as those of [[Gustave de Molinari]] and [[Auberon Herbert]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]], Gustave de. ''[http://praxeology.net/MR-GM-PS.htm Preface to &quot;The Production of Security&quot;]'', translated by J. Huston McCulloch, Occasional Papers Series #2 (Richard M. Ebeling, Editor), New York: The Center for Libertarian Studies, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;david-hart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico]], Ralph [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of anarcho-capitalists dispute these claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain; Elkin, Gary; Neal, Dave ''et al'' [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append11.html Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; version 5.2] ''An Anarchist FAQ Version 11.2'' Accessed February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism, and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all, is highly controversial. For more on this debate see ''[[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism]]''.

==Anarchism and the environment==
{{seealso|Anarcho-primitivism|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Ecofeminism}}

Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have been taking action for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization itself.{{fact}}

Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society.  It develops a critique of industrial civilization.  In this critique [[technology]] and [[development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Primitivism developed in the context of the [[Reclaim the Streets]], Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]] movements. [[John Zerzan]] wrote that [[civilization]] &amp;mdash; not just the state &amp;mdash; would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved.{{fact}} Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world's history, as examples of anarchist societies.

Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements.  Since the Western social formet in the 1960s and 1970s a number new of movements and schools have appeared.  Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.

[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hakim Bey]]]]
*'''Post-left anarchy''' - Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of  explicit hierarchy. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others. For more information, see [[Infoshop.org]]'s ''Anarchy After Leftism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/afterleftism.html Infoshop.org - Anarchy After Leftism]&lt;/ref&gt; section, and the [http://anarchism.ws/postleft.html Post-left section] on [http://anarchism.ws/ anarchism.ws.] ''See also:'' [[Post-left anarchy]]

*'''Post-structuralism''' - The term postanarchism was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn't be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. ''External reference: Postanarchism Clearinghouse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ Post anarchist clearing house]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'' [[Post-anarchism]]

*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - Insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]]. ''See also:'' [[Insurrectionary anarchism]]

*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - '''Small 'a' anarchism''' is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796]

==Other issues==
*'''Conceptions of an anarchist society''' - Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state; many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the ''cause'' of chaos, violence, and war. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly on violence]], and uses violence to advance elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.''See also:'' [[Anarchism and Society]]

*'''Civil rights and cultural sovereignty''' - [[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[National anarchism]] is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views. Its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups (or [[races]]) from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved.  It focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators. The [[Zapatista]] movement of Chiapas, Mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities.

*'''Neocolonialism and Globalization''' - Nearly all anarchists oppose [[neocolonialism]] as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. [[Globalization]] is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Many are active in the [[anti-globalization]] movement. Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use &quot;globalization&quot; to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene.

*'''Parallel structures''' - Many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state-supported institutions and &quot;outposts,&quot;  such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[infoshop]]s, educational systems such as home-schooling, neighborhood mediation/arbitration groups, and so on.  The idea is to create the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, authoritarian one.

*'''Technology''' - Recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] is undermined and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]],  [[open source]] programming, and the [[free software movement]]. These cyber-communities include the [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]. &lt;!-- ***NEEDS SOURCE THAT E-GOLD IS USED BY ANARCHISTS*** [[Public key cryptography]] has made anonymous digital currencies such as [[e-gold]] and [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] an alternative to statist [[fiat money]]. --&gt; Some anarchists see [[information technology]] as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism. Some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modulaware.com/a/?m=select&amp;id=0684832720 The Sovereign Individual -- Mastering the transition to the information age]&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

*'''Pacifism''' - Some anarchists consider [[Pacifism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent in their philosophy. [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take it further and follow [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s belief in [[Nonviolence|non-violence]]. Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;. A lot of anarchist activity has been [[anti-war]] based.

*'''Parliamentarianism''' - In general terms, the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections, because voting amounts to condoning the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/vlntryst/hitler.html The Voluntaryist - Why I would not vote against Hitler]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Voluntaryism]] is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballots nor bullets.&quot; The anarchist case against voting is explained in ''The Ethics of Voting''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/ethics_of_voting.php Voluntaryist - The ethics of voting]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[George H. Smith]]. (Also see &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot; by [[Joe Peacott]], and writings by [[Fred Woodworth]]).

*'''Sectarianism''' - Most anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, [[sectarian]].  There is often a difference of opinion ''within'' each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools.  Some, such as [[panarchy|panarchists]], believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete. Some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction; others see opportunities for coalition-building, or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes. ''See [[anarchism without adjectives]].''

==Criticisms of anarchism==
:''Main article:'' [[Criticisms of anarchism]]

'''Violence.'''  Since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction, some people have seen it as being too violent. On the other hand hand, [[Frederick Engels]] criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough:
:''&quot;A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm ''On Authority'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utopianism.''' Anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible, or plain [[utopian]], even by many who agree that it's a nice idea in principle. For example, Carl Landauer in his book ''European Socialism'' criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian, and holds that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He holds that the belief that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Landauer|Landauer]], Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959) (retrieved from &quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ&quot; by [[Bryan Caplan]] on [[January 27]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism. For example, some, such as Benjamin Tucker, advocate privately-funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property. However, other anarchists, such as Sir [[Herbert Read]], proudly accept the characterization &quot;utopian.&quot; 

'''[[Social class|Class]] character.''' [[Marxists]] have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] or perhaps the [[lumpenproletariat]]. See e.g. Plekhanov&lt;ref&gt;[[G. V. Plekhanov]] ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/anarch/index.htm Anarchism and Socialism]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; for a Marxist critique of 1895. Anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt [[middle-class]] [[dilettante]]s, most recently in relation to [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] protesters.

'''Tacit authoritarianism.''' In recent decades anarchism has been criticised by 'situationists', 'post-anarchists' and others of preserving 'tacitly statist', authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/20 ''Society of the Spectacle] Paragraph 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocrisy.''' Some critics point to the [[sexist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny P. d'Hericourt]], ''&quot;[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/hericourt2.html Contemporary feminist critic of Proudhon]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racist]] views of some prominent anarchists, notably [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], as examples of [[hypocrisy]] inherent within anarchism. While many anarchists, however, dismiss that the personal prejudices of 19th century theorists influence the beliefs of present-day anarchists, others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be [[eurocentric]] and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like Proudhon on [[fascism]] through groups like [[Cercle Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ai.htm ''Anarchist Integralism]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by Spanish Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War was a form of illegitimate coercion, making the proffessed anarchists &quot;ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians,&quot; alongside the communists and fascists. He also criticizes the willingness of the CNT to join the (statist) Republican government during the civil war, and references [[Stanley G. Payne]]'s  book on the Franco regime which claims that the CNT entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Caplan|Caplan]], Bryan. ''&quot;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm The Anarcho-Statists of Spain]&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam_chomsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. Although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently élitist, the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:

* the [[MIT]] professor of [[Linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
* the [[science fiction]] author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
* the social historian [[Howard Zinn]] 
* entertainer and author [[Hans Alfredsson]]
* the [[Avant-garde]] artist [[Nicolás Rosselló]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]].  Militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.   

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity.  Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock, although in the modern age, hip hop, and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message.  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[punk rock]] movement; the band [[Crass]] is celebrated for its anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] punk band [[The Ex]] further exemplifies this expression.

Proudhon and Bakunin both opposed [[communism]], associating it with statism. However, in the 1870s many anarchists moved away from Bakunin's economic thinking (called &quot;collectivism&quot;) and embraced communist concepts. Communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively, and that goods be distributed by need, not labor. [http://nefac.net/node/157]

An early anarchist communist was Joseph Déjacque, the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/DejacqueJoseph.htm]&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; He announced his ideas in his US published journal Le Libertaire (1858-1861).

Peter Kropotkin, often seen as the most important theorist, outlined his economic ideas in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops. He felt co-operation is more beneficial than competition, illustrated in nature in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1897). Subsequent anarchist communists include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente's 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism. Several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty. For example, Benjamin Tucker, whilst professing respect for Kropotkin and publishing his work[http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/apx1pubs.html], described communist anarchism as &quot;pseudo-anarchism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;/&gt;

==Propaganda of the deed==
[[Image:JohannMost.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Johann Most]] was an outspoken advocate of violence]]
{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists. Some [[revolution]]aries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as [[bomb]]ings and the [[assassination]]s of [[head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called '[[propaganda by the deed]]'. 

One of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was [[Johann Most]], who said &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;{{fact}} Most's preferred method of terrorism, dynamite, earned him the moniker &quot;Dynamost.&quot;  

However, there is no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings. But at the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism. (Malatesta in &quot;On Violence&quot; and Bakunin when he refuted Nechaev).

Other anarchists, sometimes identified as [[anarcho-pacifists|pacifist anarchists]], advocated complete [[nonviolence]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchism]] ''(see below)'', was a notable exponent of [[nonviolent resistance]].

==Anarchism in the labour movement==
{{seealso|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

[[Image:Flag of Anarcho syndicalism.svg|thumb|175px|The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] was an early 20th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society. The movement pursued [[industrial action]]s, such as [[general strike]], as a primary strategy. Many anarcho-syndicalists believed in [[anarchist communism]], though not all communists believed in syndicalism.

After the [[Paris Commune|1871 repression]] French anarchism reemerged, influencing the ''Bourses de Travails'' of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. From this movement the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Work, CGT) was formed in 1895 as the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement. [[Emile Pataud]] and [[Emile Pouget]]'s writing for the CGT saw [[libertarian communism]] developing from a [[general strike]].  After 1914 the CGT moved away from anarcho-syndicalism due to the appeal of [[Bolshevism]].  French-style syndicalism was a significant movement in Europe prior to 1921, and remained a significant movement in Spain until the mid 1940s.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), founded in 1905 in the US, espoused [[industrial unionism|unionism]] and sought a [[general strike]] to usher in a stateless society. In 1923 100,000 members existed, with the support of up to 300,000. Though not explicitly anarchist, they organized by rank and file democracy, embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many Anglophone syndicalists.

Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870's, 1900 and 1910. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Prior to the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics.  With a membership of 1.58 million in 1934, the CNT played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. ''See also:'' [[Anarchism in Spain]].

Syndicalists like [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] were key figures in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. [[Latin America|Latin American]] anarchism was strongly influenced, extending to the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebellion and the [[factory occupation movements]] in Argentina. In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was joined with the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]].

Contemporary anarcho-syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities; much smaller than in the 1910s, 20s and 30s.  

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] and the [[CNT]].  The CGT claims a paid-up membership of 60,000, and received over a million votes in Spanish [[syndical]] elections.  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]], and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].  The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] also exists, claiming 2,000 paid members.  Contemporary critics of anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are [[workerist]] and fail to deal with economic life outside work.  Post-leftist critics such as [[Bob Black]] claim anarcho-syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures, such as [[Manual labour|work]] and the [[workplace]].

Anarcho-syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity, [[direct action]], and self-management.

==The Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]] anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]]).

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. 

The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of 'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and 'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, the UK's [[Anarchist Federation]], and the late [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] in the northeastern United States and bordering Canada.

==The fight against fascism==
{{main articles|[[Anti-fascism]] and [[Anarchism in Spain]]}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], [[1936]]. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in [[popular front]]s with reformist democrats and Soviet-led [[Communists]] against a common fascist enemy? Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

:&quot;Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.&quot; {{fact}}

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy. [http://melior.univ-montp3.fr/ra_forum/en/people/berry_david/fascism_or_revolution.html] In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-39) was underway. 

In reponse to the army rebellion [[Anarchism in Spain|an anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of the major [[city]] of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the  [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state.  Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism.
