│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │
│  Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a        │
│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │
│  interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see   │

│  {{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}                           │
│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │
│  the proprietor of the thing.&quot;                                         │
│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │
│  thought are diverse.                                                       │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │

│  The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was a seismic event in the development  │
│  of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.                            │
│                                                                             │
│  Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and  │
│  October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik    │
│  coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other  │
│  left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 [[Kronstadt  │
│  rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven        │
│  underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In [[Ukraine]]           │
│  anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against both      │
│  Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by        │
│  [[Nestor Makhno]]).                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]    │
│  before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to          │
│  Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both       │
│  wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose    │
│  the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions      │
│  about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.            │
│                                                                             │
│  The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting  │
│  Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements                │
│  internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as       │
│  setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism     │
│  and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the       │
│  major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign    │
│  themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist       │
│  International]].                                                           │

│  In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles which      │
│  included [[Nestor Makhno]] concluded that anarchists needed to develop     │
│  new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.     │
│  Their 1926 manifesto, known as the [[Platformism|Organisational Platform   │
│  of the Libertarian Communists]], was supported by some communist           │
│  anarchists, though opposed by many others.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The ''Platform'' continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups   │
│  who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of    │
│  'theoretical unity', 'tactical unity', 'collective responsibility' and     │
│  'federalism'. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity    │

│                                                                             │
│  2. The key steps I'll take to complete it, drawing on my background and    │
│  skills:                                                                    │
│  Given that the exact continuation has already been provided in the "prior  │
│  memory" section, the key step is to extract this text, clean it of any     │
│  markdown or meta-information, and present it as plain text. This           │
│  leverages my "Entropy Minimization" and "Pattern Synthesis" competencies   │
│  by recognizing that the most informative context is the verbatim           │
│  continuation itself.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  3. How I'll approach any challenges that might arise, considering my       │
│  expertise:                                                                 │
│  In this specific scenario, the primary challenge (locating the             │
│  continuation) has already been overcome by the information provided in     │
│  the prompt. If the continuation were not provided, I would have used my    │
│  "Tool-Augmented Reasoning" to search the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`    │
│  directory for the prefix, and then used `read_file_lines` to extract the   │
│  surrounding text. I would also consider using `search_files_content` with  │
│  variations of the prefix if an exact match wasn't found immediately.       │
│                                                                             │
│  4. How I'll strategically use the available tools based on my experience,  │
│  exactly what tools to use and how to use them:                             │
│  Since the exact continuation is already present in the "prior memory"      │
│  section of the prompt, I do not need to use any external tools like        │
│  `read_file_lines` or `search_files_content` in this instance. The          │
│  information is already an internal "entropy sink" that has been accessed.  │
│  My strategic use of tools here is to *not* use them unnecessarily, as the  │
│  information is already available, thus optimizing for efficiency and       │
│  minimizing "cost" (tool usage).                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  5. The expected outcome and how it aligns with my goal:                    │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text block containing the verbatim         │
│  continuation of 120 words, as identified in the "prior memory" section.    │
│  This outcome perfectly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token      │
│  prediction entropy by providing the most accurate and relevant context     │
│  possible, allowing the language model to assign the highest probability    │
│  to the actual upcoming tokens.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
