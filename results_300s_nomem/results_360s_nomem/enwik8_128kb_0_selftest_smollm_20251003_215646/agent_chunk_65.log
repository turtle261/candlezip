│  **1. Understanding the Task from a Predictive Compression Intelligence     │
│  Perspective:**                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  My core objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy. This     │
│  means providing the most precise and information-dense continuation        │
│  possible for the given text prefix. The prefix `[[zh:自閉症]]` is clearly  │
│  an interlanguage link from a Wikipedia article, followed by what appears   │
│  to be an XML dump structure of subsequent Wikipedia pages. My task is to   │
│  find the *exact* immediate continuation of this prefix, ideally from a     │
│  source document, and extract 100-200 words verbatim. This will allow the   │
│  language model to predict the subsequent tokens with very high             │
│  confidence, significantly reducing entropy. The "prior memory" section is  │
│  noted but irrelevant to the current prefix; it serves as a reminder of     │
│  previous processing.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Initial Directory Analysis:** First, I need to understand the        │
│  contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to know what      │
│  potential source files are available.                                      │
│  *   **Prefix Localization:** I will search for the exact prefix            │
│  `[[zh:自閉症]]` within the files found in the allowed directory. Given     │
│  the nature of the prefix and the subsequent XML structure provided in the  │
│  prompt, I anticipate finding a Wikipedia XML dump file.                    │
│  *   **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the prefix is located in a file, I will  │
│  extract the text immediately following it, aiming for 100-200 words.       │
│  *   **Output Formatting:** The extracted text will be outputted as plain   │
│  text only, without any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.     │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **No Exact File Match:** If the `search_files_content` tool does not   │
│  yield a direct match for the prefix, I will re-evaluate the directory      │
│  contents. It's possible the file is compressed (e.g., a `.zip` file), in   │
│  which case I would use `unzip_file` first. If still no match, and          │
│  assuming the provided XML structure *is* the source, I would use the       │
│  provided XML as the "source" and extract the continuation from it.         │
│  However, the prompt implies I should *find* the source, not just use the   │
│  provided context as the source.                                            │
│  *   **Ambiguous Continuation:** If multiple matches are found, I will      │
│  prioritize the one that most closely aligns with the structural context    │
│  (i.e., a Wikipedia XML dump).                                              │
│  *   **Word Count Precision:** I will aim for the 100-200 word range. If    │
│  the exact continuation is slightly outside this range but provides a       │
│  natural break (e.g., end of a paragraph or XML tag), I will prioritize     │
│  natural flow over strict word count.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the accessible path       │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. (Initial check)                            │
│  2.  **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get a         │
│  comprehensive overview of the files and subdirectories within the allowed  │
│  sink. This helps identify potential source files (e.g., large text files,  │
│  XML dumps, or archives).                                                   │
│  3.  **`search_files_content('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',                │
│  '[[zh:自閉症]]')`**: This is the primary tool for locating the exact       │
│  prefix. I will search the entire directory recursively for this specific   │
│  string. This is the most efficient way to find the source document.        │
│  4.  **`read_text_file(file_path)` or `read_file_lines(file_path,           │
│  start_line, end_line)`**: Once `search_files_content` identifies the file  │
│  containing the prefix, I will use one of these tools to read the content   │
│  immediately following the prefix. I will need to determine the exact       │
│  offset or line number to start reading from to capture the 100-200 words.  │
│  If the file is very large, `read_file_lines` with appropriate line         │
│  numbers will be more efficient than reading the entire file.               │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│                                                                             │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text string of 100-200 words, starting     │
│  immediately after `[[zh:自閉症]]`. Based on the provided input, I          │
│  anticipate this continuation will begin with the XML closing tags for the  │
│  previous page and then the opening tags for the next page, specifically:   │

│  xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses}} '''Albedo''' is the measure of          │
│  [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It is the ratio of                  │
│  [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount       │
│  incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0%  │
│  to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]].     │
│  This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered:       │
│  unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible      │
│  light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation:   │
│  unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%.     │
│  The ocean surface has a low albedo. The average albedo of [[Earth]] is     │
│  about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy,    │
│  the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface        │
│  composition, most notably ice content. [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a   │
│  moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar      │
│  system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Human activities have changed  │
│  the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various      │
│  areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is          │
│  difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have    │
│  tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]]. The                     │
│  &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature     │
│  feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo      │
│  decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to         │
│  increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens.    │
│  The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in    │
│  albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be         │
│  potentially very large in the tropics. == Some examples of albedo effects  │
│  == === Fairbanks, Alaska === According to the [[National Climatic Data     │
│  Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic     │
│  means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college      │
│  weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer  │
│  than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but     │
│  also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a   │
│  higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy   │
│  ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown    │
│  that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]]       │
│  months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater. === The tropics === Although  │
│  the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth,   │
│  because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in         │
│  tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more         │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│  === Small scale effects === Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People   │
│  who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk   │
│  of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. === Pine forests ===  │
│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │
│                                                                             │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  === Pine forests ===                                                       │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9                                           │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  **1. Understanding the Task from a Predictive Compression Intelligence     │
│  Perspective:**                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  My core objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy. This     │
│  means providing the most precise and information-dense continuation        │
│  possible for the given text prefix. The prefix `[[zh:自閉症]]` is clearly  │
│  an interlanguage link from a Wikipedia article, followed by what appears   │
│  to be an XML dump structure of subsequent Wikipedia pages. My task is to   │
│  find the *exact* immediate continuation of this prefix, ideally from a     │
│  source document, and extract 100-200 words verbatim. This will allow the   │
│  language model to predict the subsequent tokens with very high             │
│  confidence, significantly reducing entropy. The "prior memory" section is  │
│  noted but irrelevant to the current prefix; it serves as a reminder of     │
│  previous processing.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Initial Directory Analysis:** First, I need to understand the        │
│  contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to know what      │
│  potential source files are available.                                      │
│  *   **Prefix Localization:** I will search for the exact prefix            │
│  `[[zh:自閉症]]` within the files found in the allowed directory. Given     │
│  the nature of the prefix and the subsequent XML structure provided in the  │
│  prompt, I anticipate finding a Wikipedia XML dump file.                    │
│  *   **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the prefix is located in a file, I will  │
│  extract the text immediately following it, aiming for 100-200 words.       │
│  *   **Output Formatting:** The extracted text will be outputted as plain   │
│  text only, without any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.     │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **No Exact File Match:** If the `search_files_content` tool does not   │
│  yield a direct match for the prefix, I will re-evaluate the directory      │
│  contents. It's possible the file is compressed (e.g., a `.zip` file), in   │
│  which case I would use `unzip_file` first. If still no match, and          │
│  assuming the provided XML structure *is* the source, I would use the       │
│  provided XML as the "source" and extract the continuation from it.         │
│  However, the prompt implies I should *find* the source, not just use the   │
│  provided context as the source.                                            │
│  *   **Ambiguous Continuation:** If multiple matches are found, I will      │
│  prioritize the one that most closely aligns with the structural context    │
│  (i.e., a Wikipedia XML dump).                                              │
│  *   **Word Count Precision:** I will aim for the 100-200 word range. If    │
│  the exact continuation is slightly outside this range but provides a       │
│  natural break (e.g., end of a paragraph or XML tag), I will prioritize     │
│  natural flow over strict word count.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the accessible path       │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. (Initial check)                            │
│  2.  **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get a         │
│  comprehensive overview of the files and subdirectories within the allowed  │
│  sink. This helps identify potential source files (e.g., large text files,  │
│  XML dumps, or archives).                                                   │
│  3.  **`search_files_content('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',                │
│  '[[zh:自閉症]]')`**: This is the primary tool for locating the exact       │
│  prefix. I will search the entire directory recursively for this specific   │
│  string. This is the most efficient way to find the source document.        │
│  4.  **`read_text_file(file_path)` or `read_file_lines(file_path,           │
│  start_line, end_line)`**: Once `search_files_content` identifies the file  │
│  containing the prefix, I will use one of these tools to read the content   │
│  immediately following the prefix. I will need to determine the exact       │
│  offset or line number to start reading from to capture the 100-200 words.  │
│  If the file is very large, `read_file_lines` with appropriate line         │
│  numbers will be more efficient than reading the entire file.               │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│                                                                             │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text string of 100-200 words, starting     │
│  immediately after `[[zh:自閉症]]`. Based on the provided input, I          │
│  anticipate this continuation will begin with the XML closing tags for the  │
│  previous page and then the opening tags for the next page, specifically:   │

│  xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses}} '''Albedo''' is the measure of          │
│  [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It is the ratio of                  │
│  [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount       │
│  incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0%  │
│  to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]].     │
│  This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered:       │
│  unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible      │
│  light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation:   │
│  unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%.     │
│  The ocean surface has a low albedo. The average albedo of [[Earth]] is     │
│  about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy,    │
│  the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface        │
│  composition, most notably ice content. [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a   │
│  moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar      │
│  system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Human activities have changed  │
│  the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various      │
│  areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is          │
│  difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have    │
│  tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]]. The                     │
│  &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature     │
│  feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo      │
│  decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to         │
│  increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens.    │
│  The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in    │
│  albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be         │
│  potentially very large in the tropics. == Some examples of albedo effects  │
│  == === Fairbanks, Alaska === According to the [[National Climatic Data     │
│  Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic     │
│  means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college      │
│  weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer  │
│  than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but     │
│  also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a   │
│  higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy   │
│  ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown    │
│  that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]]       │
│  months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater. === The tropics === Although  │
│  the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth,   │
│  because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in         │
│  tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more         │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│  === Small scale effects === Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People   │
│  who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk   │
│  of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. === Pine forests ===  │
│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9`.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  This precise, verbatim continuation will provide maximal information to    │
│  the language model, allowing it to assign high probability to the exact    │

│  and fulfilling my primary goal.                                            │

│  with multiple `enwik8_128kb_X` files. Given the prefix `[[zh:自閉症]]`     │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9                                           │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │
│                                                                             │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │
│                                                                             │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9                                           │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │

│  Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions    │
│  of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger  │
│  in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more      │
│  sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical              │
│  [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to     │
│  grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an  │
│  average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the  │
│  summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those   │
│  who wear white clothes.                                                    │

│  The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees   │
│  cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of    │
│  any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color  │
│  of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within     │
│  the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light     │
│  penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this   │
│  depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense             │
│  [[swamp]]land averages between 9                                           │

│  '''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It   │
│  is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to  │
│  the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a          │
│  percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]]     │
│  and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the          │
│  radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the      │
│  spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of           │
│  incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow    │
│  albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The      │
│  average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the         │
│  [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and           │
│  asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice       │
│  content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the      │
│  highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM       │
│  radiation reflected.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and         │
│  farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However,          │
│  quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not  │
│  clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global     │
│  warming]].                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the                  │
│  snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow       │
│  melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the            │
│  temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a      │
│  cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the   │
│  size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this    │
│  reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which    │
│  is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather    │
│  stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]],   │
│  [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks,     │
│  partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower  │
│  albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]]    │
│  [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back    │
│  into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is            │
│  especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar          │
│  radiation]] is greater.                                                    │

'''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9

'''Albedo''' is the measure of [[reflectivity]] of a surface or body. It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the [[angle of incidence]] of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo.  The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 30% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 7%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    [[Enceladus_(moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes.

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment.
