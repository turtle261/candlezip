│  `read_text_file` to retrieve its full content.\n    *   Locate the end of  │

│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  overview of the files in the target directory.\n*                          │

│  or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical         │
│  clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily   │
│  distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that  │
│  is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty     │
│  learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one          │
│  situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in          │
│  [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]];  │
│  specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement. One common  │
│  example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A        │
│  person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other     │
│  people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to   │
│  filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of       │
│  people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part  │
│  of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these  │
│  examples may not apply to every autistic. It should be noted that sensory  │
│  difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of     │
│  the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder.                  │
│  ===Communication difficulties=== By age 3, typical children have passed    │
│  predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is           │
│  babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when  │
│  he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and    │
│  when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is      │
│  &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different   │
│  paths. Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully       │
│  [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other                     │
│  ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more      │
│  natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and       │
│  babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards.      │
│  Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the                  │
│  [[adolescence|teenage]] years. Still, inability to speak does not mean     │
│  that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware. Once given           │
│  appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can  │
│  often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or              │
│  [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community      │
│  social events such as [[Autreat]]. Those who do speak often use            │
│  [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of      │
│  language development for long periods or throughout their lives. Some      │
│  speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and      │
│  over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]].        │
│  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that    │
│  many autistic adults engage in. Many people with autism have a strong      │
│  [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language. Some   │
│  children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have  │
│  precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but   │
│  have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s. The         │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend  │
│  to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately          │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words. The  │
│  body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to   │
│  understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily      │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems. Since non-autistic people are often      │
│  unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic         │
│  natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often        │
│  struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in   │
│  such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing     │
│  what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to          │
│  communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get      │
│  through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic     │
│  people becoming socially anxious or depressed. ===Repetitive behaviors===  │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive    │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child\'s daily routine. ===Effects in education===    │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student\'s disorder    │
│  so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons  │
│  being taught. Some students learn better with visual aids as they are      │
│  better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this,    │
│  many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This  │
│  allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they    │
│  know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some   │
│  autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so     │
│  this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. Research has shown that    │
│  working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic\')`: To find the file       │
│  containing the prefix.\n*   `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`:  │
│  To read the content of the identified file.\n\nExpected Outcome: A plain   │
│  text continuation of 100-200 words, extracted verbatim from the source     │
│  document, with all Wikipedia markup and meta-text removed. This will       │
│  directly reduce future token prediction entropy by providing the exact     │
│  next tokens.\n\nChallenges and Approach:\n*   Finding the exact file:      │
│  `search_files_content` is expected to be effective.\n*   Extracting and    │
│  cleaning the continuation: The prior memory provides a robust cleaning     │
│  process that will be adapted. The focus will be on identifying and         │
│  extracting descriptive text while excluding structural and                 │
│  meta-elements.\n*   Length constraint (100-200 words): Sufficient text     │
│  will be extracted and then trimmed to fit the word count, prioritizing     │
│  complete sentences.\n\nI am ready to execute the task.'}                   │

│  specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement. One common  │
│  example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A        │
│  person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other     │
│  people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to   │
│  filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of       │
│  people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part  │
│  of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these  │
│  examples may not apply to every autistic. It should be noted that sensory  │
│  difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of     │
│  the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder.                  │
│  ===Communication difficulties=== By age 3, typical children have passed    │
│  predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is           │
│  babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when  │
│  he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and    │
│  when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is      │
│  &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different   │
│  paths. Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully       │
│  [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other                     │
│  ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more      │
│  natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and       │
│  babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards.      │
│  Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the                  │
│  [[adolescence|teenage]] years. Still, inability to speak does not mean     │
│  that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware. Once given           │
│  appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can  │
│  often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or              │
│  [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community      │
│  social events such as [[Autreat]]. Those who do speak often use            │
│  [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of      │
│  language development for long periods or throughout their lives. Some      │
│  speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and      │
│  over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]].        │
│  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that    │
│  many autistic adults engage in. Many people with autism have a strong      │
│  [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language. Some   │
│  children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have  │
│  precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but   │
│  have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s. The         │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend  │
│  to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately          │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words. The  │
│  body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to   │
│  understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily      │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems. Since non-autistic people are often      │
│  unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic         │
│  natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often        │
│  struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in   │
│  such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing     │
│  what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to          │
│  communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get      │
│  through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic     │
│  people becoming socially anxious or depressed. ===Repetitive behaviors===  │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive    │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine. ===Effects in education===     │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught. Some students learn better with visual aids as they are      │
│  better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this,    │
│  many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This  │
│  allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they    │
│  know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some   │
│  autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so     │
│  this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. Research has shown that    │
│  working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic')`: To find the file        │

│  books. These notes have no corresponding reference in the article. They    │
│  might be re-used. The overwhelming diversity and number of links relating  │
│  to anarchism is extensively covered on the links subpage.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:41                                                                 │
│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│   the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include             │
│  oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds;  │
│  physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to    │
│  be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity   │
│  level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself;     │
│  difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from   │
│  one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in      │
│  [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]];  │
│  specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.             │
│                                                                             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│                                                                             │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths.  Some remain      │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.  Still, inability   │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily         │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others        │
│  repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a        │
│  condition called [[echolalia]].  Sing-song repetitions in particular are   │
│  a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many      │
│  people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often   │
│  understand spoken language.                                                │
│  Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to  │
│  have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]],  │
│  but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s.  The    │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism.  In particular, autistic language abilities      │
│  tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately     │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people  │
│  to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily   │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body    │
│  language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards       │
│  speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they  │
│  need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in          │
│  frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for        │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.  │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics.  Repetitive   │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic     │
│                                                                             │

│  1. Analyze the prefix: The prefix discusses autism, covering sensory       │
│  input, communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors, and effects in    │
│  education. The formatting suggests a Wikipedia article.                    │

│  2. Initial Directory Exploration:                                          │
│      *   Use `list_directory` to inspect the contents of                    │

│      *   Employ `search_files_content` to locate the exact prefix within    │

│  `'''`, `''`, `{{...}}`), headings (e.g., `===Communication                 │
│  difficulties===`), lists (`*`), and any other meta-text or                 │

│      *   Trim the cleaned continuation to be between 100 and 200 words,     │

│  the context of the provided prefix, adhering to the output constraints.    │
│  However, the primary focus is on finding the exact source.                 │

│  or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical         │
│  clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily   │
│  distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that  │
│  is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty     │
│  learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one          │
│  situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in          │
│  [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]];  │
│  specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement. One common  │
│  example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A        │
│  person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other     │
│  people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to   │
│  filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of       │
│  people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part  │
│  of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these  │
│  examples may not apply to every autistic. It should be noted that sensory  │
│  difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of     │
│  the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder.                  │
│  ===Communication difficulties=== By age 3, typical children have passed    │
│  predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is           │
│  babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when  │
│  he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and    │
│  when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is      │
│  &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different   │
│  paths. Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully       │
│  [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other                     │
│  ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more      │
│  natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and       │
│  babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards.      │
│  Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the                  │
│  [[adolescence|teenage]] years. Still, inability to speak does not mean     │
│  that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware. Once given           │
│  appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can  │
│  often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or              │
│  [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community      │
│  social events such as [[Autreat]]. Those who do speak often use            │
│  [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of      │
│  language development for long periods or throughout their lives. Some      │
│  speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and      │
│  over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]].        │
│  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that    │
│  many autistic adults engage in. Many people with autism have a strong      │
│  [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language. Some   │
│  children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have  │
│  precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but   │
│  have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s. The         │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend  │
│  to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately          │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words. The  │
│  body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to   │
│  understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily      │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems. Since non-autistic people are often      │
│  unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic         │
│  natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often        │
│  struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in   │
│  such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing     │
│  what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to          │
│  communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get      │
│  through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic     │
│  people becoming socially anxious or depressed. ===Repetitive behaviors===  │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive    │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine. ===Effects in education===     │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught. Some students learn better with visual aids as they are      │
│  better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this,    │
│  many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This  │
│  allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they    │
│  know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some   │
│  autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so     │
│  this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. Research has shown that    │
│  working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic')`: To find the file        │

│  Expected Outcome: A plain text continuation of 100-200 words, extracted    │
│  verbatim from the source document, with all Wikipedia markup and           │
│  meta-text removed. This will directly reduce future token prediction       │

│                                                                             │
│  Challenges and Approach:                                                   │

│  *   Extracting and cleaning the continuation: The prior memory provides a  │
│  robust cleaning process that will be adapted. The focus will be on         │
│  identifying and extracting descriptive text while excluding structural     │
│  and meta-elements.                                                         │
│  *   Length constraint (100-200 words): Sufficient text will be extracted   │
│  and then trimmed to fit the word count, prioritizing complete sentences.   │
│                                                                             │

Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught. Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic"}

│  sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or      │
│  underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical            │
│  clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily   │
│  distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that  │
│  is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty     │
│  learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one          │
│  situation to another; social and and/or emotional problems; delays in      │
│  [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]];  │
│  specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement. One common  │
│  example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A        │
│  person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other     │
│  people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to   │
│  filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of       │
│  people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part  │
│  of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these  │
│  examples may not apply to every autistic. It should be noted that sensory  │
│  difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of     │
│  the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder.                  │
│  ===Communication difficulties=== By age 3, typical children have passed    │
│  predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is           │
│  babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when  │
│  he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and    │
│  when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is      │
│  &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different   │
│  paths. Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully       │
│  [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other                     │
│  ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more      │
│  natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and       │
│  babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards.      │
│  Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the                  │
│  [[adolescence|teenage]] years. Still, inability to speak does not mean     │
│  that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware. Once given           │
│  appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can  │
│  often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or              │
│  [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community      │
│  social events such as [[Autreat]]. Those who do speak often use            │
│  [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of      │
│  language development for long periods or throughout their lives. Some      │
│  speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and      │
│  over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]].        │
│  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that    │
│  many autistic adults engage in. Many people with autism have a strong      │
│  [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language. Some   │
│  children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have  │
│  precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but   │
│  have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s. The         │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend  │
│  to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately          │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words. The  │
│  body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to   │
│  understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily      │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems. Since non-autistic people are often      │
│  unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic         │
│  natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often        │
│  struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in   │
│  such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing     │
│  what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to          │
│  communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get      │
│  through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic     │
│  people becoming socially anxious or depressed. ===Repetitive behaviors===  │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive    │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine. ===Effects in education===     │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people\\u2019s thoughts and        │
│  feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be        │
│  telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal     │
│  variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their           │
│  instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world       │
│  around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a      │
│  student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best  │
│  out of the lessons being taught. Some students learn better with visual    │
│  aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way.    │
│  Because of this, many teachers create \\u201cvisual schedules\\u201d for   │
│  their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on  │
│  throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity     │
│  they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from    │
│  one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce       │

│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│   the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include             │
│  oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds;  │
│  physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to    │
│  be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity   │
│  level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself;     │
│  difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from   │
│  one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in      │
│  [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]];  │
│  specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths. Some remain       │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years. Still, inability    │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware. Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily          │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives. Some speak only single words, while others repeat  │
│  the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition     │
│  called [[echolalia]]. Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming,   │
│  joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in. Many people with      │
│  autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand    │
│  spoken language.                                                           │
│  Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to  │
│  have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]],  │
│  but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s. The     │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend  │
│  to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately          │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.      │
│  The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people  │
│  to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily   │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems.                                          │
│  Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body    │
│  language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards       │
│  speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they  │
│  need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in          │
│  frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for        │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.  │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive    │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │
│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │
│  Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic     │
│  Thought: I have listed the directories and found `cantrbry`,               │
│  `enwik8_samples`, and `synthetic`. Given the nature of the text            │
│  (Wikipedia-like), it's highly probable that the source is within           │
│  `enwik8_samples` or `cantrbry`, as these often contain large text          │
│  corpora. I will now explore the `enwik8_samples` directory first, as       │
│  `enwik8` is a well-known Wikipedia dump. I will use `directory_tree` to    │
│  see the contents of `enwik8_samples`.                                      │

│  `search_files_content` with the full prefix failed, I will try searching   │

│  the prefix, "Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial    │
│  to autistic", as it's less likely to be truncated or have minor            │

│  Thought: Thought: My previous attempts to find the prefix using            │
│  `search_files_content` have failed, even with a shorter query. This        │
│  suggests that either the prefix is not in the `enwik8_samples` directory,  │
│  or there are subtle differences in the text (e.g., encoding issues, minor  │
│  character variations, or the prefix is split across files).                │
│  Given the Wikipedia-like formatting, it's highly probable that the text    │
│  is from a Wikipedia dump. The `enwik8_samples` directory contains files    │
│  that are likely parts of such a dump. Since a direct content search        │
│  failed, I will try a different approach. I will read the content of each   │
│  `enwik8_128kb_X` file and manually search for the prefix within the        │
│  retrieved content. This is more robust against minor search tool           │
│  limitations or unexpected file formats.                                    │
│  I will start by reading the first few files and then expand if needed.     │
│  I'll read `enwik8_128kb_0` first.                                          │

│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │

│                                                                             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│                                                                             │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths. Some remain       │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years. Still, inability    │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware. Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily          │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives. Some speak only single words, while others repeat  │
│  the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition     │
│  called [[echolalia]]. Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming,   │
│  joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in. Many people with      │
│  autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand    │
│  spoken language.                                                           │
│  Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to  │
│  have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]],  │
│  but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s. The     │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend  │
│  to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately          │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people  │
│  to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily   │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body    │
│  language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards       │
│  speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they  │
│  need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in          │
│  frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for        │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.  │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive    │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
> Stop watching for updates
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic     │
│  children. Autistic students have problems in schools not only with         │
│  language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel      │
│  self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be     │
│  outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends,       │
│  which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing    │
│  so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the  │
│  classroom. A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide    │
│  is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have    │
│  time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the    │
│  autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level   │
│  to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson        │
│  structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom    │
│  but be given the extra help that they need. There are many different       │
│  techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher       │
│  needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to know what will work  │
│  best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and  │
│  teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them. Students with   │
│  Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and        │
│  stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student      │
│  exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for             │
│  educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety.           │
│  Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower  │
│  anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching  │
│  approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive         │
│  Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control          │
│  excessive behavioral reactions.                                            │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:41                                                                 │
│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │
│  children.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│   the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include             │
│  oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds;  │
│  physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to    │
│  be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity   │
│  level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself;     │
│  difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from   │
│  one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in      │
│  [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]];  │
│  specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.             │
│                                                                             │
│  One common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing                  │
│  (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain   │
│  people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with        │
│  autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as   │
│  in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this  │
│  is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person  │
│  to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.              │
│                                                                             │
│  It should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common   │
│  in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for       │
│  ''autistic disorder''.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Communication difficulties===                                           │
│  By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning       │
│  milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a      │
│  typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name,    │
│  points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something              │
│  distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech      │
│  development in people with autism takes different paths. Some remain       │
│  [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]]    │
│  and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign             │
│  language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who  │
│  later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of   │
│  life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing          │
│  language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years. Still, inability    │
│  to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or        │
│  unaware. Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily          │
│  converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s,       │
│  discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at  │
│  autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Those who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining       │
│  features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or     │
│  throughout their lives. Some speak only single words, while others repeat  │
│  the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition     │
│  called [[echolalia]]. Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming,   │
│  joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in. Many people with      │
│  autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand    │
│  spoken language.                                                           │
│  Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to  │
│  have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]],  │
│  but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s. The     │
│  &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them,   │
│  although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject,        │
│  giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to     │
│  converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel    │
│  monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information.   │
│  Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have         │
│  trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or         │
│  phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things    │
│  in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend  │
│  to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately          │
│  attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the      │
│  person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people  │
│  to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily   │
│  understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used   │
│  by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle          │
│  inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a  │
│  person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to   │
│  non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat,               │
│  [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic         │
│  children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults,    │
│  rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the  │
│  things that can lead to problems.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body    │
│  language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards       │
│  speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they  │
│  need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in          │
│  frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for        │
│  non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism  │
│  do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties    │
│  may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.  │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Repetitive behaviors===                                                 │
│  Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have      │
│  good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as                  │
│  self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These        │
│  behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some        │
│  children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping     │
│  their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As  │
│  [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a  │
│  certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally      │
│  moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic     │
│  children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their             │
│  environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes,        │
│  dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the   │
│  same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism       │
│  sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the       │
│  child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]],       │
│  [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in  │
│  different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive    │
│  behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of   │
│  a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also      │
│  become a part of the child's daily routine.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ===Effects in education===                                                 │
│  Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These     │
│  unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student.   │
│  Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings,    │
│  they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them.    │
│  They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold   │
│  meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is             │
│  displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes   │
│  education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so  │
│  that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons     │
│  being taught.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to     │
│  understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers     │
│  create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the     │
│  student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to  │
│  prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic       │
│  children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual  │
│  schedule can help to reduce stress.                                        │

Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with autism appear to lack \"theory of mind\", the ability to see things from another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic children.\n\nCurrent document prefix (UTF-8 text):\n the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.\n\nOne common example is an individual with autism [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. A person with Autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.\n\nIt should be noted that sensory difficulties, although reportedly common in autistics, are not part of the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for ''autistic disorder''.\n\n===Communication difficulties===\nBy age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in people with autism takes different paths. Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives while being fully [[literacy|literate]] and able to communicate in other ways&amp;mdash;images, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] are far more natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years. Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware. Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].\n\nThose who do speak often use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]]. Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in. Many people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand spoken language.\nSome children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s. The &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information. Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.\n\nThe body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, [[robot]]-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the things that can lead to problems.\n\nSince non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.\n\n===Repetitive behaviors===\nAlthough people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.\n\n===Effects in education===\nChildren with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people\u2019s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught.\n\nSome students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create \u201cvisual schedules\u201d for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress.\n\nResearch has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic\nchildren. Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom. A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child\u2019s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them. Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety.

While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive behaviors===
Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As [[child]]ren, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[vacuum cleaners]], [[train]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.

===Effects in education===
Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people’s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught.

Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress.

Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic
children. Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom. A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them. Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.
