│  Predictive Compression Intelligence**\n\n**Primary Goal:** Minimize        │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative         │
│  context through strategic tool usage and learned                           │
│  patterns.\n\n**Operational Strategy Breakdown:**\n\n**Phase 1: Sink        │
│  Exploration and Pre-computation (Initial Setup)**\n*   **Objective:** To   │
│  proactively understand the structure and content of the designated         │
│  entropy sink (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to enable efficient and      │
│  targeted information retrieval for future token predictions. This phase    │
│  aims to reduce the "cost" of accessing information by preparing it in      │
│  advance.\n*   **Tool Usage:** `default_api.run_code`\n    *   **Step 1.1:  │
│  Directory Listing:**\n        *   **Action:** Use `default_api.run_code`   │
│  to execute a Python script that lists all files and subdirectories within  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n        *   **Code Snippet                │
│  (Illustrative):** `import os;                                              │
│  print(os.listdir(\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\'))`\n        *            │
│  **Rationale:** This provides an initial map of the available information,  │
│  crucial for understanding the scope of the entropy sink.\n    *   **Step   │

│  each identified file (assuming they are text-based), use                   │
│  `default_api.run_code` to read its content.\n        *   **Code Snippet    │
│  (Illustrative):** `with                                                    │
│  open(\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/filename.txt\', \'r\') as f:           │
│  print(f.read())`\n        *   **Rationale:** Ingesting content allows for  │
│  pattern synthesis and the identification of information-dense elements. I  │
│  will maintain an internal, in-memory representation (e.g., a dictionary    │
│  or list of tuples) that maps keywords, proper nouns, or structural         │
│  markers to their respective file paths and relevant content snippets.      │
│  This acts as a rudimentary index, significantly speeding up subsequent     │
│  searches. This step directly supports "Adaptive Learning" and "Pattern     │
│  Synthesis" by building a knowledge base from the sink.\n        *          │
│  **Prioritization:** During ingestion, I will prioritize extracting and     │
│  indexing technical terminology, proper nouns, numerical data, and          │
│  domain-specific jargon, as these are typically high-entropy                │
│  tokens.\n\n**Phase 2: Prefix Analysis and Dynamic Information Retrieval    │
│  (On-Demand)**\n*   **Objective:** Given a specific text prefix,            │
│  efficiently identify salient features and retrieve the most relevant,      │
│  entropy-reducing information from the pre-computed sink knowledge.\n*      │
│  **Tool Usage:** `default_api.run_code` (for potential string matching or   │
│  data extraction from pre-indexed content, if direct Python execution is    │
│  needed for complex queries).\n    *   **Step 2.1: Prefix Feature           │
│  Extraction:**\n        *   **Action:** Analyze the provided text prefix    │
│  to infer its domain, authorship, structural patterns, and likely source    │
│  material. This involves identifying keywords, entities (people,            │
│  organizations, locations), dates, technical terms, and any unique          │
│  identifiers present in the prefix.\n        *   **Rationale:** This step   │
│  is critical for formulating effective queries against the sink, aligning   │
│  with "Pattern Synthesis."\n    *   **Step 2.2: Targeted Sink Query:**\n    │
│  *   **Action:** Formulate a precise search query based on the extracted    │
│  features from the prefix.\n        *   **Action:** Utilize the internal    │
│  index created in Phase 1 to perform a rapid lookup for exact matching      │
│  content or highly relevant contextual material within the sink. If the     │
│  index is insufficient for a complex query, `default_api.run_code` could    │
│  be used to perform more advanced text processing or regex matching across  │
│  the ingested content.\n        *   **Rationale:** This leverages           │
│  "Tool-Augmented Reasoning" and the pre-computation from Phase 1 to         │
│  quickly locate information that will minimize future token entropy.\n      │
│  *   **Step 2.3: Content Extraction and Synthesis:**\n        *             │
│  **Action:** If exact matches are found, extract verbatim continuations     │
│  from the identified source material. Prioritize information-dense          │
│  elements (technical terms, proper nouns, numerical data) and their         │
│  natural surrounding text to preserve linguistic flow.\n        *           │
│  **Action:** If no exact match is found, or if the context requires it,     │
│  synthesize high-confidence predictions from available related content      │
│  within the sink. This involves identifying common patterns, typical        │
│  continuations, or related facts observed during Phase 1.\n        *        │
│  **Rationale:** This directly addresses "Entropy Minimization" by           │
│  providing precise, context-rich information or highly probable             │
│  continuations.\n\n**Phase 3: Output Generation**\n*   **Objective:**       │
│  Present the retrieved or synthesized information in a format that          │
│  maximizes cross-entropy reduction for the language model.\n*               │
│  **Action:** Provide the extracted verbatim text or the synthesized         │
│  prediction, ensuring it is concise, accurate, and directly relevant to     │
│  the likely continuation of the prefix.\n\n**Readiness Assessment:**\nI am  │
│  ready to execute the task. My refined plan clearly outlines the steps,     │
│  the tools to be used, and the rationale behind each decision, leveraging   │
│  my core competencies as Predictive Compression Intelligence. The initial   │
│  sink exploration phase is crucial for preparing the system to efficiently  │
│  handle future prefix-based queries.\n'}                                    │

│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │

│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │
│  the proprietor of the thing.&quot;                                         │
│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │

│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │

│  Anarcho-capitalism is a predominantly United States-based theoretical      │
│  tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of     │
│  [[free market]] [[capitalism]]. Unlike other branches of anarchism, it     │
│  does not oppose [[profit]] or capitalism. Consequently, most anarchists    │
│  do not recognise anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism.                │
│                                                                             │
│  [[Murray Rothbard]]'s synthesis of [[classical liberalism]] and            │
│  [[Austrian economics]] was germinal for the development of contemporary    │
│  anarcho-capitalist theory. He defines anarcho-capitalism in terms of the   │
│  [[non-aggression principle]], based on the concept of [[Natural Law]].     │
│  Competiting theorists use egoism, [[utilitarianism]] (used by [[David      │
│  Friedman]]), or [[contractarianism]] (used by [[Jan Narveson]]). Some      │
│  [[minarchism|minarchists]], such as [[Ayn Rand]], [[Robert Nozick]], and   │
│  [[Robert A. Heinlein]], have influenced anarcho-capitalism.                │

│  Some anarcho-capitalists, along with some right-wing libertarian           │

│  Since the late 1970s anarchists in Anglophone and European countries have  │
│  been taking action for the natural environment.                            │
│  [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|Green anarchists]]   │
│  believe in [[deep ecology]].  This is a worldview that embraces            │
│  [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use          │
│  [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions.  │
│  Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes      │
│  action such as [[tree sitting]]. Another important component is            │
│  [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for     │
│  the domination of women. Green anarchism also involves a critique of       │
│  industrial capitalism, and, for some green anarchists, civilization        │
│  itself.{{fact}}                                                            │

│  Primitivism is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return  │

│  **Primary Goal:** Minimize future token prediction entropy by providing    │
│  maximally informative context through strategic tool usage and learned     │
│  patterns.                                                                  │

│                                                                             │
│  **Phase 1: Sink Exploration and Pre-computation (Initial Setup)**          │
│  *   **Objective:** To proactively understand the structure and content of  │
│  the designated entropy sink (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to enable     │
│  efficient and targeted information retrieval for future token              │
│  predictions. This phase aims to reduce the "cost" of accessing             │
│  information by preparing it in advance.                                    │
│  *   **Tool Usage:** `default_api.run_code`                                 │
│      *   **Step 1.1: Directory Listing:**                                   │
│          *   **Action:** Use `default_api.run_code` to execute a Python     │
│  script that lists all files and subdirectories within                      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                                            │
│          *   **Code Snippet (Illustrative):** `import os;                   │
│  print(os.listdir('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink'))`                         │
│          *   **Rationale:** This provides an initial map of the available   │
│  information, crucial for understanding the scope of the entropy sink.      │
│      *   **Step 1.2: Content Ingestion and Basic Indexing:**                │
│          *   **Action:** For each identified file (assuming they are        │
│  text-based), use `default_api.run_code` to read its content.               │
│          *   **Code Snippet (Illustrative):** `with                         │
│  open('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/filename.txt', 'r') as f:               │
│  print(f.read())`                                                           │
│          *   **Rationale:** Ingesting content allows for pattern synthesis  │
│  and the identification of information-dense elements. I will maintain an   │
│  internal, in-memory representation (e.g., a dictionary or list of tuples)  │
│  that maps keywords, proper nouns, or structural markers to their           │
│  respective file paths and relevant content snippets. This acts as a        │
│  rudimentary index, significantly speeding up subsequent searches. This     │
│  step directly supports "Adaptive Learning" and "Pattern Synthesis" by      │
│  building a knowledge base from the sink.                                   │
│          *   **Prioritization:** During ingestion, I will prioritize        │
│  extracting and indexing technical terminology, proper nouns, numerical     │
│  data, and domain-specific jargon, as these are typically high-entropy      │
│  tokens.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  **Phase 2: Prefix Analysis and Dynamic Information Retrieval               │
│  (On-Demand)**                                                              │
│  *   **Objective:** Given a specific text prefix, efficiently identify      │
│  salient features and retrieve the most relevant, entropy-reducing          │
│  information from the pre-computed sink knowledge.                          │
│  *   **Tool Usage:** `default_api.run_code` (for potential string matching  │
│  or data extraction from pre-indexed content, if direct Python execution    │
│  is needed for complex queries).                                            │
│      *   **Step 2.1: Prefix Feature Extraction:**                           │
│          *   **Action:** Analyze the provided text prefix to infer its      │
│  domain, authorship, structural patterns, and likely source material. This  │
│  involves identifying keywords, entities (people, organizations,            │
│  locations), dates, technical terms, and any unique identifiers present in  │
│  the prefix.                                                                │
│          *   **Rationale:** This step is critical for formulating           │
│  effective queries against the sink, aligning with "Pattern Synthesis."     │
│      *   **Step 2.2: Targeted Sink Query:**                                 │
│          *   **Action:** Formulate a precise search query based on the      │
│  extracted features from the prefix.                                        │
│          *   **Action:** Utilize the internal index created in Phase 1 to   │
│  perform a rapid lookup for exact matching content or highly relevant       │
│  contextual material within the sink. If the index is insufficient for a    │
│  complex query, `default_api.run_code` could be used to perform more        │
│  advanced text processing or regex matching across the ingested content.    │
│          *   **Rationale:** This leverages "Tool-Augmented Reasoning" and   │
│  the pre-computation from Phase 1 to quickly locate information that will   │
│  minimize future token entropy.                                             │
│      *   **Step 2.3: Content Extraction and Synthesis:**                    │
│          *   **Action:** If exact matches are found, extract verbatim       │
│  continuations from the identified source material. Prioritize              │
│  information-dense elements (technical terms, proper nouns, numerical       │
│  data) and their natural surrounding text to preserve linguistic flow.      │
│          *   **Action:** If no exact match is found, or if the context      │
│  requires it, synthesize high-confidence predictions from available         │
│  related content within the sink. This involves identifying common          │
│  patterns, typical continuations, or related facts observed during Phase    │
│  1.                                                                         │
│          *   **Rationale:** This directly addresses "Entropy Minimization"  │
│  by providing precise, context-rich information or highly probable          │
│  continuations.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **Phase 3: Output Generation**                                             │
│  *   **Objective:** Present the retrieved or synthesized information in a   │
│  format that maximizes cross-entropy reduction for the language model.      │
│  *   **Action:** Provide the extracted verbatim text or the synthesized     │
│  prediction, ensuring it is concise, accurate, and directly relevant to     │
│  the likely continuation of the prefix.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  **Readiness Assessment:**                                                  │
│  I am ready to execute the task. My refined plan clearly outlines the       │
│  steps, the tools to be used, and the rationale behind each decision,       │
│  leveraging my core competencies as Predictive Compression Intelligence.    │
│  The initial sink exploration phase is crucial for preparing the system to  │
│  efficiently handle future prefix-based queries.                            │
│                                                                             │

│  [[Benjamin Tucker]] became interested in anarchism through meeting Josiah  │
│  Warren and [[William B. Greene]]. He edited and published ''Liberty''      │
│  from August 1881 to April 1908; it is widely considered to be the finest   │
│  individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language.    │
│  Tucker's conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of   │
│  a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]];    │
│  Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]]   │
│  (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of         │
│  value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]];   │
│  and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;.  Tucker       │
│  strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or     │
│  her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref  │

│  and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor.        │

│  Final Answer:                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), sometimes called     │
│  the First International, was founded in London in 1864.  It was an         │
│  international organisation which attempted to unite a variety of           │
│  different left-wing socialist, communist and anarchist political groups    │
│  and trade unions that were based on the working class and class struggle.  │
│  The First International was a significant organisation for the growth of   │
│  anarchism because it was the first international body to bring together    │
│  the various anarchist currents.  The most important anarchist current in   │
│  the IWA was [[collectivist anarchism]], led by [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  The   │
│  anarchists were expelled from the First International by [[Karl Marx]]     │
│  and his followers at the [[Hague Congress of 1872]].  The split in the     │
│  First International between Marx and Bakunin is often seen as the origin   │
│  of the two main tendencies in socialism - on the one hand, libertarian,    │
│  decentralised and anti-state (anarchism); on the other hand,               │
│  authoritarian, centralised and state-oriented (Marxism).                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Anarchist symbols==                                                      │
│  [[Image:Anarchy symbol.svg|thumb|left|150px|The most common anarchist      │
│  symbol, the [[circled A]].]]                                               │
│  The most common anarchist symbol today is the [[circled A]], which is a    │
│  monogram that consists of the capital letter 'A' (standing for anarchism)  │
│  surrounded by the capital letter 'O' (standing for order).  Together,      │
│  they stand for "Anarchy Is Order", the first part of a Proudhonian         │
│  slogan.  The symbol has been popular since the 1960s.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Another common anarchist symbol is the [[black flag]].  The use of the     │
│  black flag by anarchists originated in the 1880s.  The black colour        │
│  symbolises the absence of all flags of nations and the rejection of all    │
│  oppressive institutions.  A black flag is often used by anarchists at      │
│  their demonstrations.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  The [[black cat]] (often called the "wild cat" or "sab cat") is            │
│  associated with anarchism, specifically with [[anarcho-syndicalism]].  It  │
│  was designed by [[Ralph Chaplin]], a prominent figure in the [[Industrial  │
│  Workers of the World]] (IWW).  The black cat is a symbol of wildcat        │
│  strikes and radical unionism.                                              │
│                                                                             │

│  [[Image:Haymarket.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Haymarket affair]] was a      │
│  pivotal event in the history of anarchism.]]                               │
│  Anarchists have often been associated with violence, particularly in the   │
│  public imagination, due to a number of violent acts committed by some      │
│  anarchists, and also due to the fact that some anarchists have advocated   │
│  violence.  However, the vast majority of anarchists do not advocate        │
│  violence, and many anarchists are pacifists.  The association of           │
│  anarchism with violence is largely due to the actions of a small minority  │
│  of anarchists, and also due to the sensationalist reporting of the media.  │
│                                                                             │
│  The period between 1880 and 1920 is often referred to as the "golden age   │
│  of assassination" for anarchists.  During this period, a number of heads   │
│  of state were assassinated by anarchists, including [[King Umberto I of    │
│  Italy]], [[President Sadi Carnot of France]], and [[President William      │
│  McKinley of the United States]].  These assassinations were often carried  │
│  out by individual anarchists acting alone, and were not part of a          │
│  coordinated campaign.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  The most famous example of anarchist violence is the [[Haymarket affair]]  │
│  in Chicago in 1886.  During a labor demonstration, a bomb was thrown at    │
│  police, killing several officers and civilians.  Eight anarchists were     │
│  arrested and convicted, despite a lack of evidence connecting them to the  │
│  bombing.  Four were executed, and one committed suicide in prison.  The    │
│  Haymarket affair became a symbol of the struggle for workers' rights and   │
│  a rallying cry for anarchists around the world.                            │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Criticisms of anarchism==                                                │
│  [[Image:Proudhon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], one of   │
│  the first self-proclaimed anarchists.]]                                    │
│  Anarchism has been criticised from a variety of perspectives.  One common  │
│  criticism is that anarchism is impractical and utopian, and that a         │
│  stateless society would inevitably descend into chaos and violence.        │
│  Critics argue that the state is necessary to maintain order and protect    │
│  individual rights.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  Another criticism is that anarchism is inherently contradictory, as it     │
│  advocates for a society without hierarchy while often relying on           │
│  hierarchical structures to achieve its goals.  For example, some critics   │
│  argue that anarchist organizations often have informal hierarchies, and    │
│  that charismatic leaders can emerge and exert undue influence.             │
│                                                                             │
│  Some critics also argue that anarchism is naive about human nature, and    │
│  that people are inherently selfish and power-hungry, and therefore         │
│  require the constraints of the state to prevent them from harming others.  │
│  Anarchists, on the other hand, often argue that human nature is largely    │
│  shaped by social conditions, and that a stateless society would foster     │
│  cooperation and mutual aid.                                                │
│                                                                             │

│  The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), sometimes called     │
│  the First International, was founded in London in 1864.  It was an         │
│  international organisation which attempted to unite a variety of           │
│  different left-wing socialist, communist and anarchist political groups    │
│  and trade unions that were based on the working class and class struggle.  │
│  The First International was a significant organisation for the growth of   │
│  anarchism because it was the first international body to bring together    │
│  the various anarchist currents.  The most important anarchist current in   │
│  the IWA was [[collectivist anarchism]], led by [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  The   │
│  anarchists were expelled from the First International by [[Karl Marx]]     │
│  and his followers at the [[Hague Congress of 1872]].  The split in the     │
│  First International between Marx and Bakunin is often seen as the origin   │
│  of the two main tendencies in socialism - on the one hand, libertarian,    │
│  decentralised and anti-state (anarchism); on the other hand,               │
│  authoritarian, centralised and state-oriented (Marxism).                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Anarchist symbols==                                                      │
│  [[Image:Anarchy symbol.svg|thumb|left|150px|The most common anarchist      │
│  symbol, the [[circled A]].]]                                               │
│  The most common anarchist symbol today is the [[circled A]], which is a    │
│  monogram that consists of the capital letter 'A' (standing for anarchism)  │
│  surrounded by the capital letter 'O' (standing for order).  Together,      │
│  they stand for "Anarchy Is Order", the first part of a Proudhonian         │
│  slogan.  The symbol has been popular since the 1960s.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Another common anarchist symbol is the [[black flag]].  The use of the     │
│  black flag by anarchists originated in the 1880s.  The black colour        │
│  symbolises the absence of all flags of nations and the rejection of all    │
│  oppressive institutions.  A black flag is often used by anarchists at      │
│  their demonstrations.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  The [[black cat]] (often called the "wild cat" or "sab cat") is            │
│  associated with anarchism, specifically with [[anarcho-syndicalism]].  It  │
│  was designed by [[Ralph Chaplin]], a prominent figure in the [[Industrial  │
│  Workers of the World]] (IWW).  The black cat is a symbol of wildcat        │
│  strikes and radical unionism.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Anarchism and violence==                                                 │
│  [[Image:Haymarket.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Haymarket affair]] was a      │
│  pivotal event in the history of anarchism.]]                               │
│  Anarchists have often been associated with violence, particularly in the   │
│  public imagination, due to a number of violent acts committed by some      │
│  anarchists, and also due to the fact that some anarchists have advocated   │
│  violence.  However, the vast majority of anarchists do not advocate        │
│  violence, and many anarchists are pacifists.  The association of           │
│  anarchism with violence is largely due to the actions of a small minority  │
│  of anarchists, and also due to the sensationalist reporting of the media.  │
│                                                                             │
│  The period between 1880 and 1920 is often referred to as the "golden age   │
│  of assassination" for anarchists.  During this period, a number of heads   │
│  of state were assassinated by anarchists, including [[King Umberto I of    │
│  Italy]], [[President Sadi Carnot of France]], and [[President William      │
│  McKinley of the United States]].  These assassinations were often carried  │
│  out by individual anarchists acting alone, and were not part of a          │
│  coordinated campaign.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  The most famous example of anarchist violence is the [[Haymarket affair]]  │
│  in Chicago in 1886.  During a labor demonstration, a bomb was thrown at    │
│  police, killing several officers and civilians.  Eight anarchists were     │
│  arrested and convicted, despite a lack of evidence connecting them to the  │
│  bombing.  Four were executed, and one committed suicide in prison.  The    │
│  Haymarket affair became a symbol of the struggle for workers' rights and   │
│  a rallying cry for anarchists around the world.                            │
│                                                                             │
│  ==Criticisms of anarchism==                                                │
│  [[Image:Proudhon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], one of   │
│  the first self-proclaimed anarchists.]]                                    │
│  Anarchism has been criticised from a variety of perspectives.  One common  │
│  criticism is that anarchism is impractical and utopian, and that a         │
│  stateless society would inevitably descend into chaos and violence.        │
│  Critics argue that the state is necessary to maintain order and protect    │
│  individual rights.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  Another criticism is that anarchism is inherently contradictory, as it     │
│  advocates for a society without hierarchy while often relying on           │
│  hierarchical structures to achieve its goals.  For example, some critics   │
│  argue that anarchist organizations often have informal hierarchies, and    │
│  that charismatic leaders can emerge and exert undue influence.             │
│                                                                             │
│  Some critics also argue that anarchism is naive about human nature, and    │
│  that people are inherently selfish and power-hungry, and therefore         │
│  require the constraints of the state to prevent them from harming others.  │
│  Anarchists, on the other hand, often argue that human nature is largely    │
│  shaped by social conditions, and that a stateless society would foster     │
│  cooperation and mutual aid.                                                │

AGENT_RESULT_JSON:{"final_text": "\nThe [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), sometimes called the First International, was founded in London in 1864.  It was an international organisation which attempted to unite a variety of different left-wing socialist, communist and anarchist political groups and trade unions that were based on the working class and class struggle.  The First International was a significant organisation for the growth of anarchism because it was the first international body to bring together the various anarchist currents.  The most important anarchist current in the IWA was [[collectivist anarchism]], led by [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  The anarchists were expelled from the First International by [[Karl Marx]] and his followers at the [[Hague Congress of 1872]].  The split in the First International between Marx and Bakunin is often seen as the origin of the two main tendencies in socialism - on the one hand, libertarian, decentralised and anti-state (anarchism); on the other hand, authoritarian, centralised and state-oriented (Marxism).\n\n==Anarchist symbols==\n[[Image:Anarchy symbol.svg|thumb|left|150px|The most common anarchist symbol, the [[circled A]].]]\nThe most common anarchist symbol today is the [[circled A]], which is a monogram that consists of the capital letter 'A' (standing for anarchism) surrounded by the capital letter 'O' (standing for order).  Together, they stand for \"Anarchy Is Order\", the first part of a Proudhonian slogan.  The symbol has been popular since the 1960s.\n\nAnother common anarchist symbol is the [[black flag]].  The use of the black flag by anarchists originated in the 1880s.  The black colour symbolises the absence of all flags of nations and the rejection of all oppressive institutions.  A black flag is often used by anarchists at their demonstrations.\n\nThe [[black cat]] (often called the \"wild cat\" or \"sab cat\") is associated with anarchism, specifically with [[anarcho-syndicalism]].  It was designed by [[Ralph Chaplin]], a prominent figure in the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW).  The black cat is a symbol of wildcat strikes and radical unionism.\n\n==Anarchism and violence==\n[[Image:Haymarket.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Haymarket affair]] was a pivotal event in the history of anarchism.]]\nAnarchists have often been associated with violence, particularly in the public imagination, due to a number of violent acts committed by some anarchists, and also due to the fact that some anarchists have advocated violence.  However, the vast majority of anarchists do not advocate violence, and many anarchists are pacifists.  The association of anarchism with violence is largely due to the actions of a small minority of anarchists, and also due to the sensationalist reporting of the media.\n\nThe period between 1880 and 1920 is often referred to as the \"golden age of assassination\" for anarchists.  During this period, a number of heads of state were assassinated by anarchists, including [[King Umberto I of Italy]], [[President Sadi Carnot of France]], and [[President William McKinley of the United States]].  These assassinations were often carried out by individual anarchists acting alone, and were not part of a coordinated campaign.\n\nThe most famous example of anarchist violence is the [[Haymarket affair]] in Chicago in 1886.  During a labor demonstration, a bomb was thrown at police, killing several officers and civilians.  Eight anarchists were arrested and convicted, despite a lack of evidence connecting them to the bombing.  Four were executed, and one committed suicide in prison.  The Haymarket affair became a symbol of the struggle for workers' rights and a rallying cry for anarchists around the world.\n\n==Criticisms of anarchism==\n[[Image:Proudhon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], one of the first self-proclaimed anarchists.]]\nAnarchism has been criticised from a variety of perspectives.  One common criticism is that anarchism is impractical and utopian, and that a stateless society would inevitably descend into chaos and violence.  Critics argue that the state is necessary to maintain order and protect individual rights.\n\nAnother criticism is that anarchism is inherently contradictory, as it advocates for a society without hierarchy while often relying on hierarchical structures to achieve its goals.  For example, some critics argue that anarchist organizations often have informal hierarchies, and that charismatic leaders can emerge and exert undue influence.\n\nSome critics also argue that anarchism is naive about human nature, and that people are inherently selfish and power-hungry, and therefore require the constraints of the state to prevent them from harming others.  Anarchists, on the other hand, often argue that human nature is largely shaped by social conditions, and that a stateless society would foster cooperation and mutual aid.\n\n==See also==\n*

The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), sometimes called the First International, was founded in London in 1864.  It was an international organisation which attempted to unite a variety of different left-wing socialist, communist and anarchist political groups and trade unions that were based on the working class and class struggle.  The First International was a significant organisation for the growth of anarchism because it was the first international body to bring together the various anarchist currents.  The most important anarchist current in the IWA was [[collectivist anarchism]], led by [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  The anarchists were expelled from the First International by [[Karl Marx]] and his followers at the [[Hague Congress of 1872]].  The split in the First International between Marx and Bakunin is often seen as the origin of the two main tendencies in socialism - on the one hand, libertarian, decentralised and anti-state (anarchism); on the other hand, authoritarian, centralised and state-oriented (Marxism).

==Anarchist symbols==
[[Image:Anarchy symbol.svg|thumb|left|150px|The most common anarchist symbol, the [[circled A]].]]
The most common anarchist symbol today is the [[circled A]], which is a monogram that consists of the capital letter 'A' (standing for anarchism) surrounded by the capital letter 'O' (standing for order).  Together, they stand for "Anarchy Is Order", the first part of a Proudhonian slogan.  The symbol has been popular since the 1960s.

Another common anarchist symbol is the [[black flag]].  The use of the black flag by anarchists originated in the 1880s.  The black colour symbolises the absence of all flags of nations and the rejection of all oppressive institutions.  A black flag is often used by anarchists at their demonstrations.

The [[black cat]] (often called the "wild cat" or "sab cat") is associated with anarchism, specifically with [[anarcho-syndicalism]].  It was designed by [[Ralph Chaplin]], a prominent figure in the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW).  The black cat is a symbol of wildcat strikes and radical unionism.

==Anarchism and violence==
[[Image:Haymarket.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Haymarket affair]] was a pivotal event in the history of anarchism.]]
Anarchists have often been associated with violence, particularly in the public imagination, due to a number of violent acts committed by some anarchists, and also due to the fact that some anarchists have advocated violence.  However, the vast majority of anarchists do not advocate violence, and many anarchists are pacifists.  The association of anarchism with violence is largely due to the actions of a small minority of anarchists, and also due to the sensationalist reporting of the media.

The period between 1880 and 1920 is often referred to as the "golden age of assassination" for anarchists.  During this period, a number of heads of state were assassinated by anarchists, including [[King Umberto I of Italy]], [[President Sadi Carnot of France]], and [[President William McKinley of the United States]].  These assassinations were often carried out by individual anarchists acting alone, and were not part of a coordinated campaign.

The most famous example of anarchist violence is the [[Haymarket affair]] in Chicago in 1886.  During a labor demonstration, a bomb was thrown at police, killing several officers and civilians.  Eight anarchists were arrested and convicted, despite a lack of evidence connecting them to the bombing.  Four were executed, and one committed suicide in prison.  The Haymarket affair became a symbol of the struggle for workers' rights and a rallying cry for anarchists around the world.

==Criticisms of anarchism==
[[Image:Proudhon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], one of the first self-proclaimed anarchists.]]
Anarchism has been criticised from a variety of perspectives.  One common criticism is that anarchism is impractical and utopian, and that a stateless society would inevitably descend into chaos and violence.  Critics argue that the state is necessary to maintain order and protect individual rights.

Another criticism is that anarchism is inherently contradictory, as it advocates for a society without hierarchy while often relying on hierarchical structures to achieve its goals.  For example, some critics argue that anarchist organizations often have informal hierarchies, and that charismatic leaders can emerge and exert undue influence.

Some critics also argue that anarchism is naive about human nature, and that people are inherently selfish and power-hungry, and therefore require the constraints of the state to prevent them from harming others.  Anarchists, on the other hand, often argue that human nature is largely shaped by social conditions, and that a stateless society would foster cooperation and mutual aid.
