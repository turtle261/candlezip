│  1840&lt;/ref&gt; In its place Proudhon supported what he called            │
│  'possession' - individuals can have limited rights to use resources,       │
│  capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice.   │
│  Proudhon's vision of anarchy, which he called [[mutualism]]                │
│  (mutuellisme), involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups   │
│  could trade the products of their labor using ''labor notes'' which        │
│  represented the amount of working time involved in production. This would  │
│  ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others. Workers could    │
│  freely join together in co-operative workshops. An interest-free bank      │
│  would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of            │
│  production. Proudhon's ideas were influential within French working class  │
│  movements, and his followers were active in the [[Revolution of 1848]] in  │
│  France.                                                                    │
│  Proudhon's philosophy of property is complex: it was developed in a        │
│  number of works over his lifetime, and there are differing                 │
│  interpretations of some of his ideas. ''For more detailed discussion see   │

│  {{main articles|[[Max Stirner]] and [[Egoism]]}}                           │
│  In his ''The Ego and Its Own'' Stirner argued that most commonly accepted  │
│  social institutions - including the notion of State, property as a right,  │
│  natural rights in general, and the very notion of society - were mere      │
│  illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society  that &quot;the     │
│  individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of       │
│  amoralism, in which individuals would unite in 'associations of egoists'   │
│  only when it was in their self interest to do so.  For him, property       │
│  simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to      │
│  defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have   │
│  in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am    │
│  the proprietor of the thing.&quot;                                         │
│  Stirner never called himself an anarchist - he accepted only the label     │
│  'egoist'. Nevertheless, his ideas were influential on many                 │
│  individualistically-inclined anarchists, although interpretations of his   │

│  In 1825 [[Josiah Warren]] had participated in a [[communitarian]]          │
│  experiment headed by [[Robert Owen]] called [[New Harmony]], which failed  │
│  in a few years amidst much internal conflict. Warren blamed the            │
│  community's failure on a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and a lack of  │
│  private property.  Warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist      │
│  communities which respected what he called &quot;the sovereignty of the    │
│  individual&quot; at [[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] and [[Modern   │
│  Times]]. In 1833 Warren wrote and published ''The Peaceful                 │
│  Revolutionist'', which some have noted to be the first anarchist           │
│  periodical ever published. Benjamin Tucker says that Warren &quot;was the  │
│  first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as               │
│  Anarchism.&quot; (''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900):1)                      │

│  patriarchy, they must also                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the Task (from PCI perspective): The primary goal is to      │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim  │
│  continuation of the given prefix. The "Prior memory" section in the        │
│  prompt serves as an entropy sink, already containing the precise           │
│  information required. My objective is to retrieve this information         │
│  directly and efficiently.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      *   Identify the exact continuation provided within the "Prior         │
│  memory" section of the prompt.                                             │
│      *   Extract this text, ensuring it starts immediately after the given  │
│  prefix and falls within the specified 100-200 word range.                  │
│      *   Format the extracted text as plain text, strictly adhering to the  │
│  output requirements (no markdown, analysis, or commentary).                │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach Challenges: The main challenge is to ensure absolute fidelity  │
│  to the "plain text continuation only" rule. I will meticulously copy the   │
│  provided continuation, stripping any potential meta-information or         │
│  formatting that might be implicitly present in the prompt's structure,     │
│  though the provided continuation itself appears to be raw text with        │
│  wiki-markup. I will ensure the output is only the content.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      *   No external tools (like `read_file_lines`,                         │
│  `search_files_content`, etc.) are necessary for this task. The required    │
│  information is explicitly provided within the "Prior memory" section of    │
│  the prompt itself. Accessing this directly from the prompt is the most     │
│  efficient and lowest-cost method to retrieve the information from the      │
│  designated entropy sink. The continuation provided in the prompt is: "of   │
│  a variety of theorists: Greene's ideas on [[mutualism|mutual banking]];    │
│  Warren's ideas on [[cost the limit of price|cost as the limit of price]]   │
│  (a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] variety of [[labour theory of         │
│  value]]); [[Proudhon]]'s market anarchism; [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoism]];   │
│  and, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s &quot;law of equal freedom&quot;. Tucker        │
│  strongly supported the individual's right to own the product of his or     │
│  her labour as &quot;[[private property]]&quot;, and believed in a &lt;ref  │
│  name=&quot;tucker-pay&quot;&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]], Benjamin.       │
│  ''&quot;[http://www.blackcrayon.com/page.jsp/library/tucker/tucker37.htm   │
│  Labor and Its Pay]&quot;'' Individual Liberty: Selections From the         │
│  Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker, Vanguard Press, New York, 1926, Kraus      │
│  Reprint Co., Millwood, NY, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;[[market economy]] for         │
│  trading this property. He argued that in a truly free market system        │
│  without the state, the abundance of competition would eliminate profits    │
│  and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor. Other  │
│  19th century individualists included [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Stephen       │
│  Pearl Andrews]], and [[Victor Yarros]]." This text is approximately 125    │
│  words, fitting the 100-200 word requirement.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome: The output will be the verbatim text identified in    │
│  step 4, presented as plain text. This outcome directly fulfills the        │
│  task's requirements and aligns with my goal of minimizing future token     │
│  prediction entropy by providing precise, context-rich information.         │
│                                                                             │
