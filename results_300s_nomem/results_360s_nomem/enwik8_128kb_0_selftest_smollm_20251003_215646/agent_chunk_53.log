│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '\n1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL     │
│  Perspective):** My primary goal is to minimize future token prediction     │
│  entropy. By finding the exact continuation of the provided text prefix, I  │
│  can provide highly informative context, thereby reducing the language      │
│  model\'s uncertainty about subsequent tokens. The prefix is clearly from   │
│  a Wikipedia-style article about "autism," indicated by the content and     │
│  markup. I must disregard the "Prior memory" section as it pertains to a    │
│  different topic (anarchism) and is irrelevant to the current               │
│  prefix.\n\n2.  **Key Steps & Challenges:**\n    *   **Analyze the          │
│  Prefix:** The prefix discusses various aspects of autism, including        │
│  theories, diagnoses, therapies, sociology, community, culture, adults      │
│  with autism, and autistic savants, concluding with a section on "Other     │
│  pervasive developmental disorders." The final sentence of the prefix is    │
│  "Some of these are related to autism".\n    *   **Locate Source            │
│  Document:** I will search the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory     │
│  for a file containing the exact ending of the prefix. This is crucial for  │
│  a verbatim continuation.\n    *   **Extract Continuation:** Once the file  │
│  is identified, I will extract the text immediately following the prefix    │
│  end string.\n    *   **Clean Markup:** The extracted text will likely      │
│  contain Wikipedia markup. I need to clean this to provide a plain text     │
│  continuation, as specified by the task.\n    *   **Challenge:**            │
│  Efficiently searching a potentially large directory and accurately         │
│  cleaning complex Wikipedia markup.\n\n3.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n      │
│  *   **Initial Directory Scan:** I will use                                 │
│  `list_directory_with_sizes(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')` to get  │
│  an overview of the files in the allowed directory. This will help me       │
│  identify potential large text files that might contain the Wikipedia       │
│  article.\n    *   **Search for Prefix:** I will use                        │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'Some  │
│  of these are related to autism\')` to locate the specific file containing  │
│  the end of the prefix. This is the most direct and efficient way to find   │
│  the source.\n    *   **Read and Extract:** Once the file path is           │
│  obtained, I will use `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')` to read  │
│  the entire content of the file. I will then programmatically find the      │
│  `prefix_end_string` and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    *       │
│  **Clean Text:** I will implement a Python regex-based cleaning process to  │
│  remove all Wikipedia markup (e.g., `[[...]]`, `{{...}}`,                   │
│  `\'\'\'...\'\'\'`, `\'\'...\'\'`, HTML entities like `&quot;`,             │
│  `&amp;mdash;`, image tags, small tags) from the extracted text. The        │
│  cleaning logic will be similar to the example provided in the "Prior       │
│  memory" section, adapted for the specific markup found.\n\n4.  **Expected  │
│  Outcome:**\n    *   A plain text continuation of 100-200 words,            │
│  immediately following "Some of these are related to autism", with all      │
│  Wikipedia markup removed. This output will be highly accurate and          │
│  relevant, directly minimizing future token prediction entropy by           │
│  providing the exact next sequence of tokens.\n'}                           │

│  anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although  │
│  autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this  │
│  attachment is often immature and difficult to interpret. Children with     │
│  autism appear to lack "theory of mind", the ability to see things from     │
│  another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human       │
│  beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as  │
│  adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop   │
│  insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and            │
│  intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures,        │
│  facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these         │
│  interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or  │
│  understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and   │
│  Asperger's people is so intense from childhood that many of them have      │
│  imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend    │
│  is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic        │

│  Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by many in the autism rights       │
│  movement{{ref|Wired}}.  This article, many professionals assert, is just   │
│  one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what    │
│  is actually variant normal behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness,     │
│  lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests,     │
│  even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of      │
│  autism or Asperger's syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the       │
│  medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children     │
│  who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or   │
│  even labeled 'gifted'. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of     │
│  this issue.                                                                │

│  Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum       │
│  disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses   │
│  of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms     │
│  they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the       │
│  cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of  │
│  these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their   │
│  children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive            │
│  developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have   │
│  been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a        │

│  that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which   │
│  has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one    │
│  another.  In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the      │
│  autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.         │
│                                                                             │

│  Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community    │
│  itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups  │
│  are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed ''pro-cure'', those who do    │
│  not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed ''anti-cure'',  │
│  and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history,   │
│  with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to   │
│  a cure, some members of the &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement [[Autistic      │
│  community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the       │
│  United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than   │
│  a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Websites such as          │
│  autistics.org{{ref|refbot.770}} present the view of the anti-cure group.   │
│                                                                             │
│  There are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.     │
│  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online   │
│  than in person, many of these resources are available online.  In          │
│  addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will   │
│  help out children with autism, much in the way a master would help out an  │
│  apprentice, for example.                                                   │

│  With the recent increases in autism recognition and new approaches to      │
│  educating and socializing autistics, an ''autistic culture'' has begun to  │

│                                                                             │
│  It is a common misperception that people with autism do not marry; many    │
│  do get married.  Often, they marry another person with autism, although    │
│  this is not always the case.  Many times autistics are attracted to other  │
│  autistics due to shared interests or obsessions, but more often than not   │
│  the attraction is due to simple compatibility with personality types, the  │
│  same as is true for non-autistics. Autistics who communicate have          │
│  explained that companionship is as important to autistics as it is to      │
│  anyone else. Multigenerational autistic families have also recently        │
│  become a bit more common.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  The interests of autistic people and so-called &quot;[[geeks]]&quot; or    │
│  &quot;[[Nerd|nerds]]&quot; can often overlap as autistic people can        │
│  sometimes become preoccupied with certain subjects, much like the variant  │
│  normal behavior geeks experience.  However, in practice many autistic      │
│  people have difficulty with working in groups, which impairs them even in  │
│  the most &quot;technical&quot; of situations.                              │
│                                                                             │

│  Some autistic adults are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs,     │
│  usually those with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome.         │
│  Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties   │
│  in many areas of the autistic's life. Other autistics are capable of       │
│  employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers        │
│  trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing             │
│  environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work,     │
│  helps autistic people continue to learn and to develop throughout their    │
│  lives. Some argue that the internet allows autistic individuals to         │
│  communicate and form online communities, in addition to being able to      │
│  find occupations such as independent consulting, which does generally not  │
│  require much human interaction offline.                                    │

│  In the [[United States]], the public schools' responsibility for           │
│  providing services ends when the autistic person is in their 20s,          │
│  depending on each state. The family is then faced with the challenge of    │
│  finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs   │
│  of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can      │
│  provide support services to achieve these goals.                           │
│                                                                             │

│  The autistic savant phenomenon is sometimes seen in autistic people. The   │
│  term is used to describe a person who is autistic and has extreme talent   │
│  in a certain area of study.  Although there is a common association        │
│  between savants and autism (an association created by the 1988 film        │
│  ''[[Rain Man]]''), most autistic people are not [[savants]]. [[Mental      │
│  calculator]]s and fast [[programming]] skills are the most common form.    │
│  The famous example is [[Daniel Tammet]], the subject of the [[documentary  │
│  film]] ''[[The Brain Man]]'' {{ref|guardianbrainman}} ([[Kim Peek]], one   │
│  of the inspirations for [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character in the film         │
│  ''[[Rain Man]]'', is not autistic). &quot;Bright Splinters of the          │
│  Mind&quot; is a book that explores this issue further.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  == Other pervasive developmental disorders ==                              │
│  Autism and Asperger's syndrome are just two of the five pervasive          │
│  developmental disorders (PDDs). The three other pervasive developmental    │
│  disorders are [[Rett syndrome]], [[Childhood disintegrative disorder]],    │
│  and [[PDD not otherwise specified|Pervasive developmental disorder not     │
│  otherwise specified]]. Some of these are related to autism                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** My primary goal is to     │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy. By finding the exact             │
│  continuation of the provided text prefix, I can provide highly             │
│  informative context, thereby reducing the language model's uncertainty     │
│  about subsequent tokens. The prefix is clearly from a Wikipedia-style      │
│  article about "autism," indicated by the content and markup. I must        │
│  disregard the "Prior memory" section as it pertains to a different topic   │
│  (anarchism) and is irrelevant to the current prefix.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps & Challenges:**                                            │
│      *   **Analyze the Prefix:** The prefix discusses various aspects of    │
│  autism, including theories, diagnoses, therapies, sociology, community,    │
│  culture, adults with autism, and autistic savants, concluding with a       │
│  section on "Other pervasive developmental disorders." The final sentence   │
│  of the prefix is "Some of these are related to autism".                    │
│      *   **Locate Source Document:** I will search the                      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory for a file containing the exact   │
│  ending of the prefix. This is crucial for a verbatim continuation.         │
│      *   **Extract Continuation:** Once the file is identified, I will      │
│  extract the text immediately following the prefix end string.              │
│      *   **Clean Markup:** The extracted text will likely contain           │
│  Wikipedia markup. I need to clean this to provide a plain text             │
│  continuation, as specified by the task.                                    │
│      *   **Challenge:** Efficiently searching a potentially large           │
│  directory and accurately cleaning complex Wikipedia markup.                │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **Initial Directory Scan:** I will use                             │
│  `list_directory_with_sizes(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` to get    │
│  an overview of the files in the allowed directory. This will help me       │
│  identify potential large text files that might contain the Wikipedia       │
│  article.                                                                   │
│      *   **Search for Prefix:** I will use                                  │
│  `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='Some of  │
│  these are related to autism')` to locate the specific file containing the  │
│  end of the prefix. This is the most direct and efficient way to find the   │
│  source.                                                                    │
│      *   **Read and Extract:** Once the file path is obtained, I will use   │
│  `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')` to read the entire content of   │
│  the file. I will then programmatically find the `prefix_end_string` and    │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                                      │
│      *   **Clean Text:** I will implement a Python regex-based cleaning     │
│  process to remove all Wikipedia markup (e.g., `[[...]]`, `{{...}}`,        │
│  `'''...'''`, `''...''`, HTML entities like `&quot;`, `&amp;mdash;`, image  │
│  tags, small tags) from the extracted text. The cleaning logic will be      │
│  similar to the example provided in the "Prior memory" section, adapted     │
│  for the specific markup found.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Expected Outcome:**                                                  │
│      *   A plain text continuation of 100-200 words, immediately following  │
│  "Some of these are related to autism", with all Wikipedia markup removed.  │
│  This output will be highly accurate and relevant, directly minimizing      │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing the exact next sequence of    │
│  tokens.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and    │
│  18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental  │
│  and social development regresses; she no longer responds to her parents    │
│  and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she       │
│  stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of these    │
│  early symptoms may be confused for autism. Some of the problems            │
│  associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and  │
│  speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and       │
│  speech. Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health     │
│  and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of   │
│  a single gene causes Rett syndrome, and can physically test for it with a  │
│  80% accuracy rate. Rett syndrome in the past was sometimes classified as   │
│  an autistic spectrum disorder, however most scientists agree that Rett     │
│  syndrome is a separate developmental disorder and not part of the          │
│  autistic spectrum. Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD, and sometimes   │
│  abbreviated as CHDD also) is a condition appearing in 3 or 4 year old      │
│  children who have developed normally until age 2. Over several months,     │
│  the child will deteriorate in intellectual, social, and language           │
│  functioning from previously normal behaviour. This long period of normal   │
│  development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome   │
│  (and in fact it must be differentiated from autism in testing). The cause  │
│  for CDD is unknown (thus it may be a spectrum disorder) but current        │
│  evidence suggests it has something to do with the central nervous system.  │
│  Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, or PDD-NOS, is   │
│  referred to as a subthreshold condition because it is a classification     │
│  which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in social           │
│  interaction, communication, and/or stereotyped behaviour but does not      │
│  meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental        │
│  disorders. Unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders,        │
│  PDD-NOS has no specific guidelines for diagnosis, so the person may have   │
