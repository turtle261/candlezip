│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': 'As Predictive Compression              │
│  Intelligence, my core objective is to minimize future token prediction     │
│  entropy by providing the most informative and precise continuation of the  │
│  given text prefix. The task requires me to locate the exact source         │
│  document within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, extract the  │
│  immediate continuation (100-200 words verbatim), and clean it of any       │
│  Wikipedia markup, outputting only plain text.\n\nMy understanding of the   │
│  task is that the provided prefix is a snippet from a Wikipedia XML dump,   │
│  specifically ending within the `<text>` tag of the "Autism" page. The end  │
│  of the prefix, "[[As", strongly suggests the immediate continuation is     │
│  "perger syndrome]]" followed by other descriptive content from the         │
│  "Autism" article. I must leverage my TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING to           │
│  efficiently navigate the file system and extract this information.\n\nKey  │
│  Steps:\n\n1.  **Directory Analysis:** I will begin by listing the          │
│  contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand     │
│  its structure and identify potential files that might contain Wikipedia    │
│  data (e.g., large XML files).\n    *   Tool: `directory_tree` and          │
│  `list_directory_with_sizes`.\n2.  **Source Document Identification:** I    │
│  will search for a unique and substantial part of the prefix within the     │
│  identified files to pinpoint the exact source document containing the      │
│  "Autism" Wikipedia page. A good search query would be "Autism is           │
│  classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder".\n    *   Tool:               │
│  `search_files_content` with `file_pattern=\'*.xml\'`.\n3.  **Content       │
│  Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, I will read its entire   │
│  content. I will then parse the XML to isolate the `<text                   │
│  xml:space="preserve">` block corresponding to the "Autism" page.\n    *    │
│  Tool: `read_text_file`.\n4.  **Prefix Location and Continuation            │
│  Extraction:** Within the extracted raw text of the "Autism" page, I will   │
│  locate the exact end of the provided prefix ("[[As"). From this point, I   │
│  will extract the subsequent 100-200 words. I will need to be careful to    │
│  include the immediate completion of the link "perger syndrome]]" and then  │
│  continue extracting descriptive text, skipping any meta-text, headings,    │
│  or lists as indicated by the "Prior memory" section\'s example.\n5.        │
│  **Markup Cleaning:** I will apply the comprehensive set of cleaning rules  │
│  provided in the "Prior memory" section to remove all Wikipedia markup      │
│  (links, bold/italic markers, HTML entities, templates, fact tags, etc.)    │
│  from the extracted continuation.\n6.  **Output Formatting:** The final     │
│  output will be strictly plain text, consisting of the cleaned 100-200      │
│  word continuation, with no markdown, analysis, or                          │
│  commentary.\n\nChallenges and Approach:\n\n*   **Large File Handling:**    │
│  If the source file is very large, `read_text_file` will load it entirely.  │
│  I will rely on the tool\'s efficiency for this.\n*   **Precise Prefix      │
│  Matching:** Ensuring an exact match for the prefix end is critical. I      │
│  will use string manipulation functions to find the precise index.\n*       │
│  **Selective Content Extraction (Skipping Meta-text):** The "Prior memory"  │
│  explicitly shows how to skip meta-text, headings, and lists. I will        │
│  implement a similar logic to identify and exclude non-descriptive          │
│  content, focusing only on the natural flow of the article\'s main text.    │
│  This will involve identifying patterns for headings (`==...==`), comments  │
│  (`<!--...-->`), and bulleted lists (`* ...`).\n\nStrategic Tool Usage      │
│  (Detailed):\n\n1.                                                          │
│  **`directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: To get a      │
│  high-level view of the directory.\n2.                                      │
│  **`list_directory_with_sizes(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**:    │
│  To identify large files that are likely to be Wikipedia dumps.\n3.         │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'Autism is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder\',           │
│  file_pattern=\'*.xml\')`**: This will be my primary tool to locate the     │
│  specific XML file containing the "Autism" article.\n4.                     │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`**: Once the file is         │
│  identified, I will read its content.\n5.  **Python string methods and      │
│  `re` module (internal to my processing, not a tool call):** I will use     │
│  these to:\n    *   Extract the `<text>` content from the XML.\n    *       │
│  Find the `prefix_end_string` within the extracted text.\n    *   Extract   │
│  the raw continuation.\n    *   Apply the provided regex and string         │
│  replacements for cleaning.\n    *   Split into words and take the first    │
│  100-200.\n\nExpected Outcome:\n\nThe expected outcome is a highly          │
│  accurate, plain text continuation of 100-200 words, directly following     │
│  the provided prefix. This output will be free of any Wikipedia markup or   │
│  extraneous formatting, directly fulfilling the task requirements and       │
│  significantly reducing the entropy for subsequent token                    │
│  predictions.\n\nREADY: I am ready to execute the task.'}                   │

│                                                                             │

│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │

│  '''Autism''' is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that           │
│  manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication    │
│  ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Although the specific [[etiology]] of autism is unknown, many researchers  │
│  suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to   │
│  environmental triggers. And while there is disagreement about the          │
│  magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors,          │
│  researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among          │
│  individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as  │
│  many as one [[United States]] child in 166, however the [[National         │
│  Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in  │
│  1000{{ref|NihAutismov2005}}. For families that already have one autistic   │
│  child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in        │
│  twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]]        │
│  criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.    │
│                                                                             │
│  Autism may not be [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious. A complete       │
│  physical and [[neurological]] evaluation will typically be part of         │
│  diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single          │
│  condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in      │
│  similar ways.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  By definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction,    │
│  language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative       │
│  play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years&quot;, according to the  │
│  [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD-10]]  │
│  also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three        │
│  years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism      │
│  epidemic|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by    │
│  [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the            │
│  [[scientific community]].                                                  │

│  Some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to   │
│  the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and     │
│  social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure      │
│  from autism is impossible with current technology. However, many autistic  │
│  children and adults who are able to communicate (at least in writing) are  │
│  opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see such conditions as   │
│  part of who they are.                                                      │

│  As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my core objective is to minimize   │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing the most informative and      │
│  precise continuation of the given text prefix. The task requires me to     │
│  locate the exact source document within the                                │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, extract the immediate            │
│  continuation (100-200 words verbatim), and clean it of any Wikipedia       │
│  markup, outputting only plain text.                                        │

│  My understanding of the task is that the provided prefix is a snippet      │
│  from a Wikipedia XML dump, specifically ending within the `<text>` tag of  │
│  the "Autism" page. The end of the prefix, "[[As", strongly suggests the    │
│  immediate continuation is "perger syndrome]]" followed by other            │
│  descriptive content from the "Autism" article. I must leverage my          │
│  TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING to efficiently navigate the file system and       │

│  Key Steps:                                                                 │

│  1.  **Directory Analysis:** I will begin by listing the contents of the    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its structure and   │
│  identify potential files that might contain Wikipedia data (e.g., large    │
│  XML files).                                                                │
│      *   Tool: `directory_tree` and `list_directory_with_sizes`.            │
│  2.  **Source Document Identification:** I will search for a unique and     │
│  substantial part of the prefix within the identified files to pinpoint     │
│  the exact source document containing the "Autism" Wikipedia page. A good   │
│  search query would be "Autism is classified as a neurodevelopmental        │
│  disorder".                                                                 │
│      *   Tool: `search_files_content` with `file_pattern='*.xml'`.          │
│  3.  **Content Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, I will     │
│  read its entire content. I will then parse the XML to isolate the `<text   │
│  xml:space="preserve">` block corresponding to the "Autism" page.           │
│      *   Tool: `read_text_file`.                                            │
│  4.  **Prefix Location and Continuation Extraction:** Within the extracted  │
│  raw text of the "Autism" page, I will locate the exact end of the          │
│  provided prefix ("[[As"). From this point, I will extract the subsequent   │
│  100-200 words. I will need to be careful to include the immediate          │
│  completion of the link "perger syndrome]]" and then continue extracting    │
│  descriptive text, skipping any meta-text, headings, or lists as indicated  │
│  by the "Prior memory" section's example.                                   │
│  5.  **Markup Cleaning:** I will apply the comprehensive set of cleaning    │
│  rules provided in the "Prior memory" section to remove all Wikipedia       │
│  markup (links, bold/italic markers, HTML entities, templates, fact tags,   │
│  etc.) from the extracted continuation.                                     │
│  6.  **Output Formatting:** The final output will be strictly plain text,   │
│  consisting of the cleaned 100-200 word continuation, with no markdown,     │
│  analysis, or commentary.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  Challenges and Approach:                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Large File Handling:** If the source file is very large,             │
│  `read_text_file` will load it entirely. I will rely on the tool's          │
│  efficiency for this.                                                       │
│  *   **Precise Prefix Matching:** Ensuring an exact match for the prefix    │
│  end is critical. I will use string manipulation functions to find the      │
│  precise index.                                                             │
│  *   **Selective Content Extraction (Skipping Meta-text):** The "Prior      │
│  memory" explicitly shows how to skip meta-text, headings, and lists. I     │
│  will implement a similar logic to identify and exclude non-descriptive     │
│  content, focusing only on the natural flow of the article's main text.     │
│  This will involve identifying patterns for headings (`==...==`), comments  │
│  (`<!--...-->`), and bulleted lists (`* ...`).                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Strategic Tool Usage (Detailed):                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **`directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get a    │
│  high-level view of the directory.                                          │
│  2.  **`list_directory_with_sizes(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**:  │
│  To identify large files that are likely to be Wikipedia dumps.             │
│  3.  **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',           │
│  query='Autism is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder',             │
│  file_pattern='*.xml')`**: This will be my primary tool to locate the       │
│  specific XML file containing the "Autism" article.                         │
│  4.  **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`**: Once the file is       │
│  identified, I will read its content.                                       │
│  5.  **Python string methods and `re` module (internal to my processing,    │
│  not a tool call):** I will use these to:                                   │
│      *   Extract the `<text>` content from the XML.                         │
│      *   Find the `prefix_end_string` within the extracted text.            │
│      *   Extract the raw continuation.                                      │
│      *   Apply the provided regex and string replacements for cleaning.     │
│      *   Split into words and take the first 100-200.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  Expected Outcome:                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  The expected outcome is a highly accurate, plain text continuation of      │
│  100-200 words, directly following the provided prefix. This output will    │
│  be free of any Wikipedia markup or extraneous formatting, directly         │
│  fulfilling the task requirements and significantly reducing the entropy    │
│  for subsequent token predictions.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: My previous search for "Autism is classified as a        │
│  neurodevelopmental disorder" within `enwik8_samples` yielded no results.   │
│  This is unexpected, as the prefix clearly indicates a Wikipedia article.   │
│  It's possible that the `enwik8_samples` files are not XML or are           │
│  compressed in a way that `search_files_content` cannot parse their         │
│  content directly, or the query string is too long and might be split       │
│  across chunks.                                                             │
│  Given the prefix structure, it looks like a raw Wikipedia XML dump. I      │
│  need to find a file that contains the full XML structure, including        │
│  `<page>`, `<title>`, and `<text>` tags. The `enwik8_samples` files might   │
│  be raw text chunks, not the full XML.                                      │
│  Let's re-evaluate the directory structure. The `directory_tree` showed     │
│  only `cantrbry`, `enwik8_samples`, and `synthetic`. None of these          │
│  explicitly suggest a large XML dump.                                       │
│  I will try a broader search for the term "Autism" within all files in the  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, without specifying a pattern,    │
│  to see if any other file contains it. This might help me locate the        │
│  correct source file, even if it's not named intuitively. I will also try   │
│  to search for a shorter, more unique part of the prefix, like              │
│  "AfghanistanMilitary" or "Autism" itself, to see if I can locate the file  │
│  containing these page titles.                                              │
│  Let's try searching for "Autism" as a page title.                          │

│  The area around Aachen has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] age,     │
│  with evidence of settlement from as far back as 3000 BC. [[Roman           │
│  Empire|Romans]] settled in Aachen after discovering the hot [[sulphur]]ic  │
│  springs, and the city was named ''Aquae Granni'', Grannus being the        │
│  [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] god of healing.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  After the Roman era, [[Franks]] settled in the area. The city was known    │
│  as ''Aquisgrani'' in the [[Middle Ages]]. The Frankish king [[Pepin the    │
│  Short]] (714-768) had a castle built in the city, and his son              │
│  [[Charlemagne]] (742-814) spent most winters between 792 and his death in  │
│  814 in Aachen. Charlemagne made Aachen the capital of his empire, and had  │
│  the [[Aachen Cathedral]] built. He was buried there in 814.                │
│                                                                             │

│  Aachen remained a city of importance in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until    │
│  the [[Reformation]]. It was a center for the coronation of emperors, a     │
│  spa town, and a market town. It suffered during the [[Thirty Years'        │
│  War]], and in 1656, a great fire destroyed 4,000 houses.                   │

│  The area around Aachen has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] age,     │
│  with evidence of settlement from as far back as 3000 BC. [[Roman           │
│  Empire|Romans]] settled in Aachen after discovering the hot [[sulphur]]ic  │
│  springs, and the city was named ''Aquae Granni'', Grannus being the        │
│  [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] god of healing.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  After the Roman era, [[Franks]] settled in the area. The city was known    │
│  as ''Aquisgrani'' in the [[Middle Ages]]. The Frankish king [[Pepin the    │
│  Short]] (714-768) had a castle built in the city, and his son              │
│  [[Charlemagne]] (742-814) spent most winters between 792 and his death in  │
│  814 in Aachen. Charlemagne made Aachen the capital of his empire, and had  │
│  the [[Aachen Cathedral]] built. He was buried there in 814.                │
│                                                                             │
│  In 936, [[Otto I]] was crowned king of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in        │
│  Aachen Cathedral. For the next 600 years, most [[Holy Roman                │
│  Emperor|German kings]] were crowned in Aachen. The city became a [[Free    │
│  Imperial City]] in 1166.                                                   │

│  Aachen remained a city of importance in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until    │
│  the [[Reformation]]. It was a center for the coronation of emperors, a     │
│  spa town, and a market town. It suffered during the [[Thirty Years'        │
│  War]], and in 1656, a great fire destroyed 4,000 houses.                   │
│                                                                             │
│  Aachen became a French city in 1794, and in 1815, it became part of        │
│  [[Prussia]].                                                               │

It is the westernmost city in Germany, located near the borders with [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], 65 km (40 miles) west of [[Cologne]]. It is the 13th largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nThe city's population is 257,000 (as of December 31, 2005). The city is home to the [[RWTH Aachen University]], one of Germany's leading universities of technology.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Aachener Dom.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Aachen Cathedral]]]]\nThe area around Aachen has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] age, with evidence of settlement from as far back as 3000 BC. [[Roman Empire|Romans]] settled in Aachen after discovering the hot [[sulphur]]ic springs, and the city was named ''Aquae Granni'', Grannus being the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] god of healing.\n\nAfter the Roman era, [[Franks]] settled in the area. The city was known as ''Aquisgrani'' in the [[Middle Ages]]. The Frankish king [[Pepin the Short]] (714-768) had a castle built in the city, and his son [[Charlemagne]] (742-814) spent most winters between 792 and his death in 814 in Aachen. Charlemagne made Aachen the capital of his empire, and had the [[Aachen Cathedral]] built. He was buried there in 814.\n\nIn 936, [[Otto I]] was crowned king of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Aachen Cathedral. For the next 600 years, most [[Holy Roman Emperor|German kings]] were crowned in Aachen. The city became a [[Free Imperial City]] in 1166.\n\nAachen remained a city of importance in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the [[Reformation]]. It was a center for the coronation of emperors, a spa town, and a market town. It suffered during the [[Thirty Years' War]], and in 1656, a great fire destroyed 4,000 houses.\n\nAachen became a French city in 1794, and in 1815, it became part of [[Prussia]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Aachen was the first German city to be taken by the [[Allies]].\n\n==Geography==\nAachen is located at 50\u00b046' North, 6\u00b005' East. Its highest point is 410 m (1,345 ft) above sea level, its lowest point is 125 m (410 ft) above sea level.\n\n==Culture==\nAachen is famous for its [[Aachen Cathedral]], which is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. It is also famous for its &quot;Printen&quot;, a kind of [[gingerbread]].\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.aachen.de/ Official website]\n* [http://www.aachen.com/ Aachen.com]\n* [http://www.rwth-aachen.de/ RWTH Aachen University]\n* [http://www.fh-aachen.de/ FH Aachen (University of Applied Sciences)]\n* [http://www.dom.aachen.de/ Aachen Cathedral]\n* [http://www.aachener-zeitung.de/ Aachener Zeitung] (local newspaper)\n* [http://www.aachener-nachrichten.de/ Aachener Nachrichten] (local newspaper)\n\n[[Category:Cities in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:Cities in Germany]]\n[[Category:Former Free Imperial Cities]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Germany]]\n\n[[ar:\u0622\u062e\u0646]]\n[[bg:\u0410\u0430\u0445\u0435\u043d]]\n[[ca:Aquisgr\u00e0]]\n[[cs:C\u00e1chy]]\n[[da:Aachen]]\n[[de:Aachen]]\n[[et:Aachen]]\n[[es:Aquisgr\u00e1n]]\n[[eo:Aachen]]\n[[fr:Aix-la-Chapelle]]\n[[gl:Aquisgr\u00e1n]]\n[[ko:\uc544\ud5e8]]\n[[hr:Aachen]]\n[[id:Aachen]]\n[[it:Aquisgrana]]\n[[he:\u05d0\u05d0\u05db\u05df]]\n[[hu:Aachen]]\n[[nl:Aken]]\n[[ja:\u30a2\u30fc\u30d8\u30f3]]\n[[no:Aachen]]\n[[pl:Akwizgran]]\n[[pt:Aachen]]\n[[ro:Aachen]]\n[[ru:\u0410\u0445\u0435\u043d]]\n[[sk:Aachen]]\n[[sl:Aachen]]\n[[sr:\u0410\u0445\u0435\u043d]]\n[[fi:Aachen]]\n[[sv:Aachen]]\n[[tr:Aachen]]\n[[zh:\u4e9a\u741b]]</text>\n    </revision>\n  </page>\n  <page>\n    <title>Aardvark</title>\n    <id>42</id>\n    <revision>\n      <id>42136833</id>\n      <timestamp>2006-03-04T01:41:25Z</timestamp>\n      <contributor>\n        <username>CJames745</username>\n        <id>832382</id>\n      </contributor>\n      <minor />\n      <comment>/* Taxonomy */  too many brackets</comment>\n      <text xml:space=\"preserve\">{{Taxobox\n|name = Aardvark\n|status = LC\n|status_system = IUCN2.3\n|status_ref = &lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;&gt;{{IUCN2006|id=41501|title=''Orycteropus afer''|assessors=Taylor, A. &amp; Lehmann, T.|year=2008|downloaded=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n|image = Aardvark.jpg\n|image_width = 250px\n|image_caption = An aardvark in [[South Africa]]\n|regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n|phylum = [[Chordate|Chordata]]\n|classis = [[Mammal]]ia\n|ordo = [[Tubulidentata]]\n|familia = [[Orycteropodidae]]\n|genus = ''[[Orycteropus]]''\n|species = '''''O. afer'''''\n|binomial = ''Orycteropus afer''\n|binomial_authority = ([[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]], 1766)\n}}\nThe '''aardvark''' ({{IPA|\u02c8\u0251\u02d0rdv\u0251\u02d0rk}}; ''Orycteropus afer'') is a medium-sized, [[burrow]]ing, [[nocturnal]] [[mammal]] native to [[Africa]].

'''Aachen''' ({{IPA|ˈaːxən}}) ({{lang-fr|Aix-la-Chapelle}}, {{lang-nl|Aken}}) is a city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. It is the westernmost city in Germany, located near the borders with [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], 65 km (40 miles) west of [[Cologne]]. It is the 13th largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia.

The city's population is 257,000 (as of December 31, 2005). The city is home to the [[RWTH Aachen University]], one of Germany's leading universities of technology.

==History==
[[Image:Aachener Dom.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Aachen Cathedral]]]]
The area around Aachen has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] age, with evidence of settlement from as far back as 3000 BC. [[Roman Empire|Romans]] settled in Aachen after discovering the hot [[sulphur]]ic springs, and the city was named ''Aquae Granni'', Grannus being the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] god of healing.

After the Roman era, [[Franks]] settled in the area. The city was known as ''Aquisgrani'' in the [[Middle Ages]]. The Frankish king [[Pepin the Short]] (714-768) had a castle built in the city, and his son [[Charlemagne]] (742-814) spent most winters between 792 and his death in 814 in Aachen. Charlemagne made Aachen the capital of his empire, and had the [[Aachen Cathedral]] built. He was buried there in 814.

In 936, [[Otto I]] was crowned king of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Aachen Cathedral. For the next 600 years, most [[Holy Roman Emperor|German kings]] were crowned in Aachen. The city became a [[Free Imperial City]] in 1166.

Aachen remained a city of importance in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the [[Reformation]]. It was a center for the coronation of emperors, a spa town, and a market town. It suffered during the [[Thirty Years' War]], and in 1656, a great fire destroyed 4,000 houses.

Aachen became a French city in 1794, and in 1815, it became part of [[Prussia]].

After [[World War II]], Aachen was the first German city to be taken by the [[Allies]].

==Geography==
Aachen is located at 50°46' North, 6°05' East. Its highest point is 410 m (1,345 ft) above sea level, its lowest point is 125 m (410 ft) above sea level.

==Culture==
Aachen is famous for its [[Aachen Cathedral]], which is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. It is also famous for its &quot;Printen&quot;, a kind of [[gingerbread]].
