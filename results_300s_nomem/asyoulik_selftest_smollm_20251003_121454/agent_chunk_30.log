│  use `list_directory` to inspect the contents of                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This will give me an overview of the       │
│  available files and help me identify potential source documents (e.g.,     │
│  text files, possibly containing plays).\n\n3. **Targeted Search for the    │
│  Prefix:** I will employ `search_files_content` to search for the exact     │
│  phrase "More than your force" within all files in the                      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This is the most efficient way   │
│  to pinpoint the source document.\n\n4. **Extract Verbatim                  │
│  Continuation:**\n    *   Once `search_files_content` returns a file path,  │
│  I will use `read_text_file` to retrieve the full content of that file.\n   │
│  *   I will then manually locate the exact position of "More than your      │
│  force" within the file content.\n    *   Starting immediately after        │
│  "force", I will extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    *   Crucially,  │
│  I will meticulously exclude speaker names (e.g., "JAQUES", "DUKE SENIOR")  │
│  and any stage directions (e.g., "[Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn]")   │
│  from the word count and the final output, as demonstrated in the previous  │
│  examples.\n\n5. **Handle Challenges:**\n    *   **No Exact Match:** If     │
│  `search_files_content` does not yield a result, I will re-evaluate the     │
│  search query, perhaps trying a slightly shorter, unique phrase from the    │
│  end of the prefix. If still unsuccessful, I would consider searching for   │
│  the play title "AS YOU LIKE IT" to locate the general text and then        │
│  manually navigate. However, the task emphasizes aggressive tool use for    │
│  exact continuation, so I expect to find it.\n    *   **Word Count          │
│  Accuracy:** I will perform a careful manual word count after extraction    │
│  to ensure it falls within the 100-200 word range. If it exceeds, I will    │
│  trim it to the closest valid word count within the range.\n    *           │
│  **Output Formatting:** The final output will be strictly plain text,       │
│  devoid of any markdown, analysis, or commentary, adhering to the task\'s   │
│  requirements.\n\n6. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a precise,    │
│  verbatim continuation of the provided prefix, between 100 and 200 words,   │
│  extracted directly from a source document found in the                     │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This will maximize               │

│  of leveraging external knowledge sources for information-dense content.'}  │

│  remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two      │
│  cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these for   │
│  my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is   │
│  mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.                │
│                                                                             │

│  I will manually locate the prefix in the provided text and then carefully  │

│  The prefix ends with "Unt". The full line is "Unto the sweet bird's        │

│  This is 196 words, which is within the 100-200 word range. I will use      │
│  this as the final answer.to the sweet bird's throat, Come hither, come     │
│  hither, come hither: Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough       │
│  weather. More, more, I prithee, more. It will make you melancholy,         │
│  Monsieur Jaques. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy  │
│  out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. My voice is  │
│  ragged: I know I cannot please you. I do not desire you to please me; I    │
│  do desire you to sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?   │
│  What you will, Monsieur Jaques. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe  │
│  me nothing. Will you sing? More at your request than to please myself.     │
│  Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call     │
│  compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks    │
│  me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the       │
│  beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.     │
│  Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under  │

│          but that they call compliment is like the encounter                │

│          methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me                │

│  memory. My task is to find the exact continuation.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Initial Directory Exploration:** I will use `list_directory` to       │
│  inspect the contents of `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This will give me  │
│  an overview of the available files and help me identify potential source   │
│  documents (e.g., text files, possibly containing plays).                   │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Targeted Search for the Prefix:** I will employ                       │
│  `search_files_content` to search for the exact phrase "More than your      │
│  force" within all files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.   │
│  This is the most efficient way to pinpoint the source document.            │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Extract Verbatim Continuation:**                                      │
│      *   Once `search_files_content` returns a file path, I will use        │
│  `read_text_file` to retrieve the full content of that file.                │
│      *   I will then manually locate the exact position of "More than your  │
│  force" within the file content.                                            │
│      *   Starting immediately after "force", I will extract the subsequent  │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│      *   Crucially, I will meticulously exclude speaker names (e.g.,        │
│  "JAQUES", "DUKE SENIOR") and any stage directions (e.g., "[Enter ORLANDO,  │
│  with his sword drawn]") from the word count and the final output, as       │
│  demonstrated in the previous examples.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Handle Challenges:**                                                  │
│      *   **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` does not yield a     │
│  result, I will re-evaluate the search query, perhaps trying a slightly     │
│  shorter, unique phrase from the end of the prefix. If still unsuccessful,  │
│  I would consider searching for the play title "AS YOU LIKE IT" to locate   │
│  the general text and then manually navigate. However, the task emphasizes  │
│  aggressive tool use for exact continuation, so I expect to find it.        │
│      *   **Word Count Accuracy:** I will perform a careful manual word      │
│  count after extraction to ensure it falls within the 100-200 word range.   │
│  If it exceeds, I will trim it to the closest valid word count within the   │
│  range.                                                                     │
│      *   **Output Formatting:** The final output will be strictly plain     │
│  text, devoid of any markdown, analysis, or commentary, adhering to the     │
│  task's requirements.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  6. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a precise, verbatim            │
│  continuation of the provided prefix, between 100 and 200 words, extracted  │
│  directly from a source document found in the                               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This will maximize               │
│  cross-entropy reduction for future token predictions, aligning perfectly   │
│  with my core competency of entropy minimization and operational strategy   │
│  of leveraging external knowledge sources for information-dense content.    │
│                                                                             │

│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have look'd on better days, If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any good man's feast, If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be: In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
