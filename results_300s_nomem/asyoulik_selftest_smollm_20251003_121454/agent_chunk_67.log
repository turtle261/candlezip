│  TOUCHSTONE      Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more       │
│  seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the                          │
│  cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,                        │
│  if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the                        │
│  mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.                          │
│  If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he                         │

│  this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was                           │

│  called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not                            │

│  is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not                        │

│  TOUCHSTONE      I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,         │
│  nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we                         │
│  measured swords and parted.                                                │

│  books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.                       │
│  The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the                           │

│  Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All                             │
│  these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may                        │
│  avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven                              │
│  justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the                         │

│  of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and                        │

│  Men of great worth resorted to this forest,                                │
│  Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,                              │
│  In his own conduct, purposely to take                                      │
│  His brother here and put him to the sword:                                 │
│  And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;                               │
│  Where meeting with an old religious man,                                   │
│  After some question with him, was converted                                │

│  Thought: Thought: The task is to find the exact immediate continuation of  │
│  the provided text prefix. The prefix appears to be from a play,            │
│  specifically "As You Like It" by William Shakespeare, given the character  │
│  names (Touchstone, Audrey, Orlando, Oliver, Celia, Rosalind, Jaques, Duke  │
│  Senior, Hymen, Phebe, William, Corin, Jaques de Boys) and the style of     │
│  dialogue. The previous memory also confirms this.                          │
│  I need to find the full text of "As You Like It" and locate the exact      │
│  position of the prefix to extract the continuation. Since I only have      │
│  access to `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`, I should first check if the      │
│  play's text is available within this directory. I will start by listing    │
│  the contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.Action:       │

│                                                                             │

│          [Enter ORLANDO and ADAM]                                           │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

│  and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and                         │

│  sighed but they asked one another the reason, no                           │
│  sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;                         │
│  and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs                       │
│  to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or                          │

│  duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it                         │
│  is to look into happiness through another man's                            │
│  eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at                          │
│  the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall                         │
│  think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.                       │

│  Rosalind?                                                                  │

│  ROSALIND        I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.         │
│  Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,                          │
│  that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I                         │
│  speak not this that you should bear a good opinion                         │
│  of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;                            │
│  neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in                       │
│  some little measure draw a belief from you, to do                          │
│  yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if                        │
│  you please, that I can do strange things: I have,                          │
│  since I was three year old, conversed with a                               │
│  magician, most profound in his art and yet not                             │
│  damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart                        │
│  as your gesture cries it out, when your brother                            │
│  marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into                           │
│  what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is                           │
│  not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient                        │
│  to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human                         │
│  as she is and without any danger.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Speakest thou in sober meanings?                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I          │
│  say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your                            │
│  best array: bid your friends; for if you will be                           │
│  married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.                │

consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
shall be to your good; for my father's house and all
the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I
estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.

ORLANDO	You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:
thither will I invite the duke and all's contented
followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look
you, here comes my Rosalind.

	[Enter ROSALIND]

ROSALIND	God save you, brother.

OLIVER	And you, fair sister.

	[Exit]

ROSALIND	O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee
wear thy heart in a scarf!

ORLANDO	It is my arm.

ROSALIND	I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
of a lion.

ORLANDO	Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.

ROSALIND	Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?

ORLANDO	Ay, and greater wonders than that.

ROSALIND	O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was
never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and
overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
sighed but they asked one another the reason, no

and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs

is to look into happiness through another man's
eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.

ROSALIND	Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?

Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
