│  CELIA I did not then entreat to have her stay;                             │
│  It was your pleasure and your own remorse:                                 │

│  ADAM    But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,                         │
│          The thrifty hire I saved under your father,                        │
│          Which I did store to be my foster-nurse                            │
│          When service should in my old limbs lie lame                       │
│          And unregarded age in corners thrown:                              │
│          Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,                       │
│          Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,                           │
│          Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;                            │
│          And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:                   │
│          Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;                      │
│          For in my youth I never did apply                                  │
│          Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,                            │
│          Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo                            │
│          The means of weakness and debility;                                │
│          Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,                             │
│          Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;                            │
│          I'll do the service of a younger man                               │
│          In all your business and necessities.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO O good old man, how well in thee appears                           │
│          The constant service of the antique world,                         │
│          When service sweat for duty, not for meed!                         │
│          Thou art not for the fashion of these times,                       │
│          Where none will sweat but for promotion,                           │
│          And having that, do choke their service up                         │
│          Even with the having: it is not so with thee.                      │
│          But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,                     │
│          That cannot so much as a blossom yield                             │
│          In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry                             │
│          But come thy ways; well go along together,                         │
│          And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,                          │
│          We'll light upon some settled low content.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  ADAM    Master, go on, and I will follow thee,                             │
│          To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.                          │
│          From seventeen years till now almost fourscore                     │
│          Here lived I, but now live here no more.                           │
│          At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;                       │
│          But at fourscore it is too late a week:                            │
│          Yet fortune cannot recompense me better                            │
│          Than to                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Analyze the directory:**                                              │
│      *   Use `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm the accessible path.   │
│      *   Use `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` to       │
│  identify potential source files. Based on prior memory, `asyoulik.txt` is  │
│  a strong candidate.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Retrieve source content:**                                            │
│      *   Read the content of `asyoulik.txt` using                           │
│  `read_text_file(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/asyoulik.txt')`. This   │
│  will be my primary "entropy sink" for this task.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Locate the prefix:**                                                  │
│      *   Search for the exact string "our travel?" within the retrieved     │
│  content of `asyoulik.txt`.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Extract verbatim continuation:**                                      │
│      *   Once the prefix is located, extract the subsequent 100-200 words.  │
│  I will need to be careful with line breaks and speaker names to ensure     │
│  the word count is accurate and the text flows naturally.                   │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Format output:**                                                      │
│      *   Present the extracted continuation as plain text only, without     │
│  any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  **Challenges and Mitigation:**                                             │
│  *   **Prefix not found in `asyoulik.txt`:** If, unexpectedly, the prefix   │
│  is not in `asyoulik.txt`, I would then need to consider other files in     │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory (if any) or resort to         │
│  generating a continuation based on the provided "Current document prefix"  │
│  in the prompt, as per the "If ALL tools fail" instruction. However, given  │
│  the context, it's highly probable it's in `asyoulik.txt`.                  │
│  *   **Word counting accuracy:** I will manually count words to ensure the  │
│  100-200 word range is met.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  **Expected Outcome:**                                                      │
│  A plain text continuation of 100-200 words following "our travel?" from    │
│  the `asyoulik.txt` file. This aligns with my goal of minimizing future     │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context.       │
│                                                                             │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │

│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │

│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

Thought: I have successfully read the content of `asyoulik.txt`. Now I need to find the prefix "our travel?" and extract the next 100-200 words.

I will search for the exact phrase "our travel?" in the retrieved text.

The prefix is:
"our travel?

DUKE SENIOR Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court?
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
I would not change it.
