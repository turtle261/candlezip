│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1. **Analyze the prefix:** The prefix clearly identifies the source as     │
│  Shakespeare's "As You Like It", Act V, Scene IV, ending with the line      │
│  "Duke Frederick, hearing how". This provides precise context for the       │
│  search.                                                                    │
│  2. **Explore the allowed directory:** Use `directory_tree` to get an       │
│  overview of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to identify       │
│  potential files containing the play's text.                                │
│  3. **Search for the specific text:** If `directory_tree` doesn't           │
│  immediately reveal a clear file, use `search_files_content` within the     │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to find the exact phrase "Duke    │
│  Frederick, hearing how" to pinpoint the relevant document and location     │
│  within it. This is the most efficient way to locate the exact              │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│  4. **Read the identified file:** Once the file is identified, use          │
│  `read_text_file` to access its content.                                    │
│  5. **Extract and trim the continuation:** Locate the line "Duke            │
│  Frederick, hearing how" and extract the subsequent 100-200 words           │
│  verbatim.                                                                  │
│  6. **Format the output:** Ensure the extracted text is presented as plain  │
│  text only, without any markdown, analysis, or commentary, as per the task  │
│  requirements.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
