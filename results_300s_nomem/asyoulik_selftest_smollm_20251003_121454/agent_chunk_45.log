│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │

│  ROSALIND        With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that         │
│          hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because               │
│          he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because               │
│          he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean               │
│          and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden                 │
│          of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.                 │

│  ROSALIND        With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as           │
│          softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.         │
│                                                                             │

│  ROSALIND        With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between       │
│          term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.           │
│                                                                             │

│  ORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could                      │
│          purchase in so removed a dwelling.                                 │

│  ROSALIND        I have been told so of many: but indeed an old             │
│          religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was                │
│          in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship                │
│          too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard                  │
│          him read many lectures against it, and I thank God                 │
│          I am not a woman, to be touched with so many                       │
│          giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their                    │
│          whole sex withal.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he                │
│          laid to the charge of women?                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        There were none principal; they were all like one          │
│          another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming                 │
│          monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I prithee, recount some of them.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that       │
│          are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that                   │
│          abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on                 │
│          their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies                 │
│          on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of                   │
│          Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would                │
│          give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the               │
│          quotidian of love upon him.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me                 │
│          your remedy.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he             │
│          taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage                 │
│          of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO What were his marks?                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and           │
│          sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable                      │
│          spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,                     │
│          which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for                 │
│          simply your having in beard is a younger brother's                 │
│          revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your                 │
│          bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe                 │
│          untied and every thing about you demonstrating a                   │
│          careless desolation; but you are no such man; you                  │
│          are rather point-device in your accoutrements as                   │
│          loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.               │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.              │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you           │
│          love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to                 │
│          do than to confess she does: that is one of the                    │
│          points in the which women still give the lie to                    │
│          their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he                  │
│          that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind               │
│          is so admired?                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of                       │
│          Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?          │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves        │
│          as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and                  │
│          the reason why they are not so punished and cured                  │
│          is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers               │
│          are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.               │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so?                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me         │
│          his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to                 │
│          woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish                 │
│          youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing                  │
│          and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,                    │
│          inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every               │
│          passion something and for no passion truly any                     │
│          thing, as boys and women are for the most part                     │
│          cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe              │
│          him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep               │
│          for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor                  │
│          from his mad humour of love to a living humour of                  │
│          madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of                 │
│          the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.                  │
│          And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon                │
│          me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's                  │
│          heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.              │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I would not be cured, youth.                                       │

│  ROSALIND        I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind        │
│          and come every day to my cote and woo me.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me                      │
│          where it is.                                                       │

│  ROSALIND        Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way       │
│          you shall tell me where in the forest you live.                    │
│          Will you go?                                                       │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │
