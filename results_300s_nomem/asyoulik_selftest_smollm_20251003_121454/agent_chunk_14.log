│  Thought: Thought: I apologize again for the repeated error. I am clearly   │
│  misunderstanding something fundamental about how the `read_text_file`      │
│  tool is being observed as "reused input" when it failed with "No such      │
│  file or directory". This is a critical issue I need to resolve.            │
│  The `list_directory` command *does* show `as_you_like_it.txt` in           │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. The error "No such file or directory" is   │
│  contradictory.                                                             │
│  Perhaps the issue is with the path itself, or how the tool interprets it.  │
│  I will try a different approach to get the file content. Instead of        │
│  `read_text_file`, I will use `search_files_content` with a very broad      │
│  query that is guaranteed to be in the file (e.g., "ACT I") and specify     │
│  the exact file path. This might help me confirm if the file is truly       │
│  accessible and readable by the `search_files_content` tool.                │
│  If `search_files_content` works, I can then extract the full content from  │
│  its output or use `read_text_file` again with renewed confidence in the    │
│  path.                                                                      │

│  Thought: .                                                                 │
│  Thought: I am encountering persistent issues with file access, despite     │
│  `list_directory` showing the file. The error "No matches found" for        │
│  `search_files` and `search_files_content` when using `as_you_like_it.txt`  │
│  as the pattern, and "No such file or directory" for `read_text_file`,      │
│  suggests a deeper problem with how the tools are interacting with the      │
│  file system or how I'm specifying the path/pattern.                        │
│  The `pattern` argument in `search_files` and `search_files_content` is     │
│  for glob patterns, not exact filenames. When I used `pattern:              │
│  "as_you_like_it.txt"`, it was likely looking for files *within* the        │
│  directory that match that glob, not the file itself at the root of the     │
│  search.                                                                    │
│  I need to be absolutely sure about the file's existence and                │
│  accessibility. I will try to get file information for                      │
│  `as_you_like_it.txt` directly. If `get_file_info` works, it means the      │
│  file exists and is accessible, and my previous attempts were flawed in     │
│  how I used the other tools. If it fails, then the file truly isn't there   │
│  or accessible as I expect.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
