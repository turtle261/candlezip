│  ROSALIND        Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me         │
│          his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to                 │
│          woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish                 │
│          youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing                  │
│          and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,                    │
│          inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every               │
│          passion something and for no passion truly any                     │
│          thing, as boys and women are for the most part                     │
│          cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe              │
│          him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep               │
│          for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor                  │
│          from his mad humour of love to a living humour of                  │
│          madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of                 │
│          the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.                  │
│          And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon                │
│          me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's                  │
│          heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.              │

│  TOUCHSTONE      Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,            │
│          stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple                │
│          but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what                │
│          though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are                     │
│          necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of                 │
│          his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and                  │
│          knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of                   │
│          his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?                     │
│          Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer                  │
│          hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man                 │
│          therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more                    │
│          worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a                   │
│          married man more honourable than the bare brow of a                │
│          bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no                │
│          skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to                  │
│          want. Here comes Sir Oliver.                                       │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Analyze the directory:** Use `list_directory` to inspect the          │
│  contents of `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to identify potential source    │
│  files for "As You Like It".                                                │
│  2. **Search for the source document:** If `list_directory` reveals many    │
│  files, use `search_files_content` within the                               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to locate files containing "As    │
│  You Like It" or specific lines from the provided prefix (e.g., "And his    │
│  kissing is as"). This will help pinpoint the exact play script.            │
│  3. **Locate the exact prefix:** Once a likely source file is identified,   │
│  use `read_text_file` to read its entire content. Then, programmatically    │
│  search for the exact provided prefix within the read text.                 │
│  4. **Extract continuation:** Upon finding the prefix, extract the          │
│  subsequent 100-200 words verbatim from the source document.                │
│  5. **Format output:** Ensure the extracted continuation is presented as    │
│  plain text only, without any markdown, analysis, or commentary, adhering   │
│  strictly to the task's output requirements.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  **Challenges and Mitigation:**                                             │
│  *   **Source not found:** If no relevant file is found in the              │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, or if the exact prefix cannot    │
│  be located within identified files, I will generate a continuation based   │
│  solely on the context of the provided prefix, prioritizing accuracy and    │
│  relevance over creativity, as per the task instructions.                   │
│  *   **Variations in text:** If multiple versions of "As You Like It"       │
│  exist, I will prioritize the one that most closely matches the provided    │
│  prefix's formatting and content.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                                  │
│  *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: Initial         │
│  exploration of the allowed directory.                                      │
│  *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='And  │
│  his kissing is as')`: To efficiently find the file containing the          │
│  specific prefix.                                                           │
│  *   `read_text_file(path='[identified_file_path]')`: To retrieve the full  │
│  content of the identified source document for precise extraction.          │
│                                                                             │
