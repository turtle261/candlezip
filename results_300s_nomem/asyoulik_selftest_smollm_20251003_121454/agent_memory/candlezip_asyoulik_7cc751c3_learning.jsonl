I did dislike the\ncut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,\nif I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the\nmind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.\nIf I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he\nwould send me word, he cut it to please himself:\nthis is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was\nnot well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is\ncalled the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not\nwell cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this\nis called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not\nwell cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the\nCounter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie\nCircumstantial and the Lie Direct.\nJAQUES\tAnd how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?\nTOUCHSTONE\tI durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,\nnor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we\nmeasured swords and parted.\nJAQUES\tCan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?\nTOUCHSTONE\tO sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have\nbooks for good manners: I will name you the degrees.\nThe first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the\nQuip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the\nfourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the\nCountercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with\nCircumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All\nthese you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may\navoid that too, with an If.

Good my lord, like this fellow.\nDUKE SENIOR\tI like him very well.\nTOUCHSTONE\tGod 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I\npress in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country\ncopulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as\nmarriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,\nsir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor\nhumour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else\nwill: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a\npoor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.\nDUKE SENIOR\tBy my faith, he is very swift and sententious.\nTOUCHSTONE\tAccording to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.\nJAQUES\tBut, for the seventh cause; how did you find the\nquarrel on the seventh cause?\nTOUCHSTONE\tUpon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more\nseeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the\ncut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,\nif I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the\nmind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.\nIf I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he\nwould send me word, he cut it to please himself:\nthis is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was\nnot well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is\ncalled the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not\nwell cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this\nis called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not\nwell cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the\nCounter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie\nCircumstantial and the Lie Direct.\nJAQUES\tAnd how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?\nTOUCHSTONE\tI durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,\nnor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we\nmeasured swords and parted.\nJAQUES\tCan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?\nTOUCHSTONE\tO sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have\nbooks for good manners: I will name you the degrees.\nThe first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the\nQuip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the\nfourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the\nCountercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with\nCircumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All\nthese you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may\navoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven\njustices could not take up a quarrel, but when the\nparties were met themselves, one of them thought but\nof an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and\nthey shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the\nonly peacemaker; much virtue in If.\nJAQUES\tIs not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at\nany thing and yet a fool.\nDUKE SENIOR\tHe uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under\nthe presentation of that he shoots his wit.\n[Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA]\n[Still Music]\nHYMEN\t        Then is there mirth in heaven,\nWhen earthly things made even\nAtone together.\nGood duke, receive thy daughter\nHymen from heaven brought her,\nYea, brought her hither,\nThat thou mightst join her hand with his\nWhose heart within his bosom is.\nROSALIND\t[To DUKE SENIOR]  To you I give myself, for I am yours.\n[To ORLANDO]\nTo you I give myself, for I am yours.\nDUKE SENIOR\tIf there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.\nORLANDO\tIf there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.\nPHEBE\tIf sight and shape be true,\nWhy then, my love adieu!\nROSALIND\tI'll have no father, if you be not he:\nI'll have no husband, if you be not he:\nNor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.\nHYMEN\t        Peace, ho! I bar confusion:\n'Tis I must make conclusion\nOf these most strange events:\nHere's eight that must take hands\nTo join in Hymen's bands,\nIf truth holds true contents.\nYou and you no cross shall part:\nYou and you are heart in heart\nYou to his love must accord,\nOr have a woman to your lord:\nYou and you are sure together,\nAs the winter to foul weather.\nWhiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,\nFeed yourselves with questioning;\nThat reason wonder may diminish,\nHow thus we met, and these things finish.\nSONG.\nWedding is great Juno's crown:\nO blessed bond of board and bed!\n'Tis Hymen peoples every town;\nHigh wedlock then be honoured:\nHonour, high honour and renown,\nTo Hymen, god of every town!\nDUKE SENIOR\tO my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!\nEven daughter, welcome, in no less degree.\nPHEBE\tI will not eat my word, now thou art mine;\nThy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.\n[Enter JAQUES DE BOYS]\nJAQUES DE BOYS\tLet me have audience for a word or two:\nI am the second son of old Sir Rowland,\nThat bring these tidings to this fair assembly.\nDuke Frederick, hearing how that every day\nMen of great worth resorted to this forest,\nAddress'd a mighty power; which were on foot,\nIn his own conduct, purposely to take\nHis brother here and put him to the sword:\nAnd to the skirts of this wild wood he came;\nWhere meeting with an old religious man,\nAfter some question with him, was converted\nBoth from his enterprise and from the world,\nHis crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,\nAnd all their lands restored to them again\nThat were with him exiled. This to be true,\nI do engage my life.\nDUKE SENIOR\tWelcome, young man;\nThou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:\nTo one his lands withheld, and to the other\nA land itself at large, a potent dukedom.\nFirst, in this forest, let us do those ends\nThat here were well begun and well begot:\nAnd after, every of this happy number\nThat have endured shrewd days and nights with us\nShall share the good of our returned fortune,\nAccording to the measure of their states.\nMeantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity\nAnd fall into our rustic revelry.\nPlay, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,\nWith measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.\nJAQUES\tSir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,\nThe duke hath put on a religious life\nAnd thrown into neglect the pompous court?\nJAQUES DE BOYS\tHe hath.\nJAQUES\tTo him will I : out of these convertites\nThere is much matter to be heard and learn'd.\n[To DUKE SENIOR]\nYou to your former honour I bequeath;\nYour patience and your virtue well deserves it:\n[To ORLANDO]\nYou to a love that your true faith doth merit:\n[To OLIVER]\nYou to your land and love and great allies:\n[To SILVIUS]\nYou to a long and well-deserved bed:\n[To TOUCHSTONE]\nAnd you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage\nIs but for two months victuall'd.
