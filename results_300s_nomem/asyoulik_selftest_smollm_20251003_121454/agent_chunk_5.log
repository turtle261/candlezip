│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Analyze the prefix:** The provided text is from  │
│  William Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It". The current prefix ends with the  │
│  phrase "there is not one so young and so villanous this". This specific    │
│  phrase will be used to locate the source document.\n\n2. **Explore the     │
│  allowed directory:** Use `directory_tree` to understand the file           │

│  understanding where potential source files might be located.\n\n3.         │
│  **Search for the exact phrase:** Employ `search_files_content` to find     │
│  the file containing the exact phrase "there is not one so young and so     │
│  villanous this" within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This  │
│  is the most efficient way to pinpoint the source.\n\n4. **Extract the      │
│  continuation:** Once the file is identified, use `read_text_file` to read  │
│  its content. I will then locate the exact phrase and extract the           │
│  subsequent 100-200 words verbatim. I will need to carefully handle line    │
│  breaks and ensure the word count is within the specified range.\n\n5.      │
│  **Format the output:** The extracted continuation will be presented as     │
│  plain text only, without any additional formatting, markdown, analysis,    │
│  or commentary, as per the task requirements.\n\n**Challenges and           │
│  Mitigation:**\n*   **No exact match:** If `search_files_content` fails to  │
│  find the exact phrase, I will broaden the search by trying slightly        │
│  shorter or longer segments of the text, or by searching for character      │
│  names and dialogue in combination. However, given the specificity of the   │
│  text, an exact match is highly anticipated.\n*   **File format:**          │
│  Assuming the files are plain text, `read_text_file` will be sufficient.    │
│  If the files are in other formats, the current toolset might be limited,   │
│  but the prompt implies text-based content.\n\n**Strategic Tool             │
│  Usage:**\n*   `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To  │
│  get an initial understanding of the directory structure.\n*                │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'there is not one so young and so villanous this\')`: This is the   │
│  primary tool for locating the source document.\n*                          │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: To read the content of the   │
│  identified file and extract the continuation.\n\n**Expected                │
│  Outcome:**\nThe expected outcome is a plain text continuation of 100-200   │
│  words, starting immediately after "there is not one so young and so        │
│  villanous this". This will directly contribute to minimizing future token  │
│  prediction entropy by providing highly accurate and contextually relevant  │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │
│          brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my                     │
│          gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that                │
│          grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I                   │
│          think is within me, begins to mutiny against this                  │
│          servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I                │

│          have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from              │
│          it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:                   │
│          it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full                 │
│          of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's                    │
│          good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against               │
│          me his natural brother: therefore use thy                          │
│          discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck                │
│          as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if                │
│          thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not                  │
│          mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise                   │
│          against thee by poison, entrap thee by some                        │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Analyze the prefix:** The provided text is from William               │
│  Shakespeare's "As You Like It". The current prefix ends with the phrase    │
│  "there is not one so young and so villanous this". This specific phrase    │
│  will be used to locate the source document.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Explore the allowed directory:** Use `directory_tree` to understand   │
│  the file structure within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This will help   │
│  in understanding where potential source files might be located.            │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Search for the exact phrase:** Employ `search_files_content` to find  │
│  the file containing the exact phrase "there is not one so young and so     │
│  villanous this" within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This  │
│  is the most efficient way to pinpoint the source.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Extract the continuation:** Once the file is identified, use          │
│  `read_text_file` to read its content. I will then locate the exact phrase  │
│  and extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim. I will need to          │
│  carefully handle line breaks and ensure the word count is within the       │
│  specified range.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Format the output:** The extracted continuation will be presented as  │
│  plain text only, without any additional formatting, markdown, analysis,    │
│  or commentary, as per the task requirements.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  **Challenges and Mitigation:**                                             │
│  *   **No exact match:** If `search_files_content` fails to find the exact  │
│  phrase, I will broaden the search by trying slightly shorter or longer     │
│  segments of the text, or by searching for character names and dialogue in  │
│  combination. However, given the specificity of the text, an exact match    │
│  is highly anticipated.                                                     │
│  *   **File format:** Assuming the files are plain text, `read_text_file`   │
│  will be sufficient. If the files are in other formats, the current         │
│  toolset might be limited, but the prompt implies text-based content.       │
│                                                                             │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                                  │
│  *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an       │
│  initial understanding of the directory structure.                          │
│  *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',             │
│  query='there is not one so young and so villanous this')`: This is the     │
│  primary tool for locating the source document.                             │
│  *   `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: To read the content of     │
│  the identified file and extract the continuation.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  **Expected Outcome:**                                                      │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text continuation of 100-200 words,        │
│  starting immediately after "there is not one so young and so villanous     │
│  this". This will directly contribute to minimizing future token            │
│  prediction entropy by providing highly accurate and contextually relevant  │
│  information, allowing the language model to assign higher probability to   │
│  the actual upcoming tokens.                                                │
│                                                                             │
