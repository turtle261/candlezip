│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1.  **Understanding the Task (SIMDL    │
│  Framework):** My core objective is to minimize future token prediction     │
│  entropy by providing the exact, verbatim continuation of the given text    │
│  prefix. This aligns perfectly with the Sink-Inclusive Description Length   │
│  (SIMDL) framework, where accessing external information (entropy sinks)    │
│  to retrieve precise content directly reduces the uncertainty of upcoming   │
│  tokens. The task requires extracting 100-200 words of continuation,        │
│  prioritizing accuracy and relevance.\n\n2.  **Key Steps and Approach:**\n  │
│  *   **Identify Source:** The prefix is clearly from Shakespeare\'s "As     │
│  You Like It." My first step is to locate the full text of this play        │
│  within the allowed directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    *        │
│  **Locate Prefix:** Once the source document is identified, I will search   │
│  for the exact provided prefix within that document.\n    *   **Extract     │
│  Continuation:** After finding the prefix, I will extract the subsequent    │
│  100-200 words verbatim to form the output.\n    *   **Fallback:** If the   │
│  source document is not found or the exact continuation cannot be           │
│  extracted, I will generate a contextually relevant continuation based on   │
│  the current prefix and prior memory, ensuring it is specific and avoids    │
│  generic phrasing.\n\n3.  **Addressing Challenges:**\n    *   **Source      │
│  Document Discovery:** The primary challenge is efficiently finding the     │
│  correct play text. I will leverage `search_files_content` to directly      │
│  look for a unique phrase from the prefix within all files in the           │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This is more efficient than      │
│  listing all files and then reading them individually.\n    *   **Exact     │
│  Match Verification:** The prior memory provides the full sentence          │
│  containing the prefix. I will use this full sentence as a reference to     │
│  ensure the extracted continuation is indeed the immediate next words.\n    │
│  *   **Word Count:** I will carefully count the words after the prefix to   │
│  ensure the output falls within the 100-200 word range.\n\n4.  **Strategic  │
│  Tool Usage:**\n    *   **Tool 1: `list_allowed_directories()`:** (Initial  │
│  check, though I already know the allowed directory). This confirms my      │
│  access scope.\n    *   **Tool 2:                                           │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'is    │
│  to look into happiness through another man\'s eyes!\')`:** This is the     │
│  most critical tool. I will use a distinctive phrase from the end of the    │
│  prefix, extended slightly from the prior memory, to pinpoint the exact     │
│  file and location. The query will be "is to look into happiness through    │
│  another man\'s eyes!". This phrase is unique enough to likely identify     │
│  the specific play and scene.\n    *   **Tool 3:                            │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'[found_file_path]\')`:** Once                       │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, I will use this tool to read   │
│  the entire content of that file.\n    *   **Tool 4 (Internal Logic):**     │
│  After reading the file, I will use my internal processing capabilities to  │
│  locate the exact prefix within the file content and extract the            │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.\n\n5.  **Expected Outcome and Alignment:**\n     │
│  *   The expected outcome is a plain text string, 100-200 words long,       │
│  representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As     │
│  You Like It."\n    *   This outcome directly aligns with my goal of        │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy. By providing the exact next    │
│  sequence of tokens, I enable the language model to assign maximum          │
│  probability to these tokens, thereby achieving optimal compression under   │
│  the SIMDL framework. This is a direct application of entropy minimization  │
│  through tool-augmented reasoning.\n'}                                      │

│  I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,                                    │

│  Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day                                 │
│  Men of great worth resorted to this forest,                                │
│  Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,                              │
│  In his own conduct, purposely to take                                      │
│  His brother here and put him to the sword:                                 │
│  And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;                               │
│  Where meeting with an old religious man,                                   │
│  After some question with him, was converted                                │
│  Both from his enterprise and from the world,                               │

│          is to look into happiness through another man's                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1.  **Understanding the Task (SIMDL Framework):** My core objective is to  │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim  │
│  continuation of the given text prefix. This aligns perfectly with the      │
│  Sink-Inclusive Description Length (SIMDL) framework, where accessing       │
│  external information (entropy sinks) to retrieve precise content directly  │
│  reduces the uncertainty of upcoming tokens. The task requires extracting   │
│  100-200 words of continuation, prioritizing accuracy and relevance.        │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps and Approach:**                                            │
│      *   **Identify Source:** The prefix is clearly from Shakespeare's "As  │
│  You Like It." My first step is to locate the full text of this play        │
│  within the allowed directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.               │
│      *   **Locate Prefix:** Once the source document is identified, I will  │
│  search for the exact provided prefix within that document.                 │
│      *   **Extract Continuation:** After finding the prefix, I will         │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim to form the output.          │
│      *   **Fallback:** If the source document is not found or the exact     │
│  continuation cannot be extracted, I will generate a contextually relevant  │
│  continuation based on the current prefix and prior memory, ensuring it is  │
│  specific and avoids generic phrasing.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Addressing Challenges:**                                             │
│      *   **Source Document Discovery:** The primary challenge is            │
│  efficiently finding the correct play text. I will leverage                 │
│  `search_files_content` to directly look for a unique phrase from the       │
│  prefix within all files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.   │
│  This is more efficient than listing all files and then reading them        │
│  individually.                                                              │
│      *   **Exact Match Verification:** The prior memory provides the full   │
│  sentence containing the prefix. I will use this full sentence as a         │
│  reference to ensure the extracted continuation is indeed the immediate     │
│  next words.                                                                │
│      *   **Word Count:** I will carefully count the words after the prefix  │
│  to ensure the output falls within the 100-200 word range.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **Tool 1: `list_allowed_directories()`:** (Initial check, though   │
│  I already know the allowed directory). This confirms my access scope.      │
│      *   **Tool 2:                                                          │
│  `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='is to    │
│  look into happiness through another man's eyes!')`:** This is the most     │
│  critical tool. I will use a distinctive phrase from the end of the         │
│  prefix, extended slightly from the prior memory, to pinpoint the exact     │
│  file and location. The query will be "is to look into happiness through    │
│  another man's eyes!". This phrase is unique enough to likely identify the  │
│  specific play and scene.                                                   │
│      *   **Tool 3: `read_text_file(path='[found_file_path]')`:** Once       │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, I will use this tool to read   │
│  the entire content of that file.                                           │
│      *   **Tool 4 (Internal Logic):** After reading the file, I will use    │
│  my internal processing capabilities to locate the exact prefix within the  │
│  file content and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome and Alignment:**                                    │
│      *   The expected outcome is a plain text string, 100-200 words long,   │
│  representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As     │
│  You Like It."                                                              │
│      *   This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future     │
│  token prediction entropy. By providing the exact next sequence of tokens,  │
│  I enable the language model to assign maximum probability to these         │
│  tokens, thereby achieving optimal compression under the SIMDL framework.   │
│  This is a direct application of entropy minimization through               │
│  tool-augmented reasoning.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: My previous search for "is to look into happiness        │
│  through another man's eyes!" yielded no results. This could mean the file  │
│  is not a `.txt` file, or the exact phrase might be slightly different in   │
│  the actual source, or the file might be in a subdirectory.                 │
│  Given that the prior memory and current prefix are clearly from            │
│  Shakespeare's "As You Like It", I will try a more general search for "As   │
│  You Like It" within the allowed directory, and then once I find the file,  │
│  I will read it and manually locate the prefix. I will search for any file  │
│  type, not just `.txt`.                                                     │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │

│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

Thought: I have successfully read the entire content of `asyoulik.txt`. Now I need to find the exact prefix within this text and extract the next 100-200 words.

The prefix ends with: "is to look into happiness through another man's". I will search for this phrase in the `asyoulik.txt` content and then extract the subsequent text.

Here's the relevant part from the provided text:
"...is to look into happiness through another man's
	eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
	the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
	think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
ROSALIND	Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
ORLANDO	I can live no longer by thinking.
ROSALIND	I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;
neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
since I was three year old, conversed with a
magician, most profound in his art and yet not
damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
as she is and without any danger.
ORLANDO	Speakest thou in sober meanings?
ROSALIND	By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I
say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your
best array: bid your friends; for if you will be
married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.

	[Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]

	Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.

PHEBE	Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
	To show the letter that I writ to you.

ROSALIND	I care not if I have: it is my study
	To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
	You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
	Look upon him, love him; he worships you.

PHEBE	Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.

SILVIUS	It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
	And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND	And I for no woman.

SILVIUS	It is to be all made of faith and service;
	And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND	And I for no woman.

SILVIUS	It is to be all made of fantasy,
	All made of passion and all made of wishes,
	All adoration, duty, and observance,
	All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
	All purity, all trial, all observance;
	And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE	And so am I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO	And so am I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND	And so am I for no woman.

PHEBE	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

SILVIUS	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

ORLANDO	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

ROSALIND	Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'

ORLANDO	To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.

ROSALIND	Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling
	of Irish wolves against the moon.

	[To SILVIUS]

	I will help you, if I can:

	[To PHEBE]

	I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.

	[To PHEBE]

	I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be
	married to-morrow:

	[To ORLANDO]

	I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
	shall be married to-morrow:

	[To SILVIUS]

	I will content you, if what pleases you contents
	you, and you shall be married to-morrow.

	[To ORLANDO]

	As you love Rosalind, meet:

	[To SILVIUS]

	as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,
	I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.

SILVIUS	I'll not fail, if I live.

PHEBE	Nor I.

ORLANDO	Nor I.

	[Exeunt]

The prefix ends with "is to look into happiness through another man's".
The immediate continuation is: "eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.ROSALIND Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?ORLANDO I can live no longer by thinking.ROSALIND I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things: I have,since I was three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger.ORLANDO Speakest thou in sober meanings?ROSALIND By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your best array: bid your friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will."

I will now count the words to ensure it's within the 100-200 word range.
