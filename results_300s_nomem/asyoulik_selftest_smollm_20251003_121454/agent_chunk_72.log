│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │

│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │

│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │

│          That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.                    │
│          Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day                         │
│          Men of great worth resorted to this forest,                        │
│          Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,                      │
│          In his own conduct, purposely to take                              │
│          His brother here and put him to the sword:                         │
│          And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;                       │
│          Where meeting with an old religious man,                           │
│          After some question with him, was converted                        │
│          Both from his enterprise and from the world,                       │
│          His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,                     │
│          And all their lands restored to them again                         │
│          That were with him exiled. This to be true,                        │
│          I do engage my life.                                               │

│          A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.                          │
│          First, in this forest, let us do those ends                        │
│          That here were well begun and well begot:                          │

│          Shall share the good of our returned fortune,                      │
│          According to the measure of their states.                          │

│          Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,                  │

│  Thought: Thought: The prefix ends with "PHEBE". The previous memory        │
│  indicates the continuation starts after "To seem despiteful and ungentle   │
│  to you:". I need to find the line number for "PHEBE" that immediately      │

│  is "Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love." I need to extract   │
│  100-200 words starting from this line. I will use `read_file_lines` with   │

│  Thought: The previous `read_file_lines` started from "SILVIUS It is to be  │
│  all made of sighs and tears;". The prompt states the continuation starts   │
│  after "To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:". The line immediately      │
│  following that is "You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;". I      │
│  need to find the line number for "You are there followed by a faithful     │
│  shepherd;" and then read from there.                                       │
│  Looking at the previous `search_files_content` output:                     │
│  3635:13: To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:                           │
│  3636:1: You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;                     │
│  So the correct starting line is 3636. I will read from line 3636 with a    │
│  limit to get 100-200 words. I will try a limit of 30 lines.                │
