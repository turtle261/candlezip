│  did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor: pardon me: I    │

│  letter And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all: She says I am not      │
│  fair, that I lack manners; She calls me proud, and that she could not      │
│  love me, Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will! Her love is not the   │
│  hare that I do hunt: Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well, This   │
│  is a letter of your own device. No, I protest, I know not the contents:    │
│  Phebe did write it. Come, come, you are a fool And turn'd into the         │
│  extremity of love. I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand. A              │
│  freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think That her old gloves were on,   │

│          year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been               │
│          for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went                │
│          but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being                  │
│          taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish                   │
│          coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'                │
│          But these are all lies: men have died from time to                 │
│          time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.                  │

│  ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,                   │
│          for, I protest, her frown might kill me.                           │

│  ROSALIND        By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now        │
│          I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on                        │
│          disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant                │
│          it.                                                                │

│  ROSALIND        Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?         │
│          Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.                │
│          Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?               │

│  ORLANDO Why now; as fast as she can marry us.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'       │
│                                                                             │

│  ROSALIND        I might ask you for your commission; but I do take         │
│          thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes                 │
│          before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought                 │
│          runs before her actions.                                           │

│  ORLANDO So do all thoughts; they are winged.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Now tell me how long you would have her after you          │
│          have possessed her.                                                │

│  ORLANDO For ever and a day.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;          │
│          men are April when they woo, December when they wed:               │
│          maids are May when they are maids, but the sky                     │
│          changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous                │
│          of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,                   │
│          more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more                    │
│          new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires                  │
│          than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana                 │
│          in the fountain, and I will do that when you are                   │
│          disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and                │
│          that when thou art inclined to sleep.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so?                                        │

│  ORLANDO O, but she is wise.                                                │

│  ROSALIND        Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the         │
│          wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's                │
│          wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and                 │
│          'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly                  │

│  ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say                │
│          'Wit, whither wilt?'                                               │

│  ROSALIND        Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met        │
│          your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.                     │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall        │
│          never take her without her answer, unless you take                 │
│          her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot                  │
│          make her fault her husband's occasion, let her                     │
│          never nurse her child herself, for she will breed                  │
│          it like a fool!                                                    │

│          would prove: my friends told me as much, and I                     │
│          thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours                   │
│          won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,                      │

│          me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,                │
│          if you break one jot of your promise or come one                   │

│          pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover                 │
│          and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that                │
│          may be chosen out of the gross band of the                         │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective): The task is to provide a       │
│  verbatim continuation of the given text prefix, specifically 100-200       │
│  words, removing speaker names and stage directions. This directly          │
│  minimizes information entropy for future token predictions. The text is    │
│  identified as from Shakespeare's "As You Like It".                         │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps & Challenges:                                                 │
│      * Leverage Prior Memory: The "Prior memory" section explicitly         │
│  contains the full text of the letter being read, which includes the        │
│  immediate continuation of the current prefix. This eliminates the need     │
│  for external file system searches in this specific instance.               │
│      * Extract Continuation: Locate the exact point in the "Prior memory"   │
│  that follows "That a maiden" and extract the subsequent text.              │
│      * Word Count and Filtering: Count the words to ensure it falls within  │
│  the 100-200 word range. Verify that no speaker names or stage directions   │
│  are present in this specific segment of the letter.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      * No external tools are required for this specific task, as the        │
│  necessary information is already present in the "Prior memory" provided    │
│  in the prompt. My "TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING" competency allows me to       │
│  recognize that the information is already available internally, making     │
│  external tool calls unnecessary and inefficient.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Expected Outcome:                                                       │
│      * A plain text continuation of 142 words, verbatim from the provided   │
│  "Prior memory", following the line "That a maiden", with no speaker names  │
│  or stage directions. This outcome directly aligns with my goal of          │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the exact,         │
│  information-dense continuation.                                            │
│                                                                             │
