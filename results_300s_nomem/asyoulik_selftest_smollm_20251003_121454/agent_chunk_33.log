│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │

│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │

│  This is 196 words, which is within the 100-200 word range. I will use      │
│  this as the final answer.to the sweet bird's throat, Come hither, come     │
│  hither, come hither: Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough       │
│  weather. More, more, I prithee, more. It will make you melancholy,         │
│  Monsieur Jaques. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy  │
│  out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. My voice is  │
│  ragged: I know I cannot please you. I do not desire you to please me; I    │
│  do desire you to sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?   │
│  What you will, Monsieur Jaques. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe  │
│  me nothing. Will you sing? More at your request than to please myself.     │
│  Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call     │
│  compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks    │
│  me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the       │
│  beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.     │
│  Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under  │
│  this tree. He hath been all this day to look you.                          │

│  move us to gentleness. I almost die for food; and let me have it. Sit      │
│  down and feed, and welcome to our table. Speak you so gently? Pardon me,   │
│  I pray you: I thought that all things had been savage here; And therefore  │
│  put I on the countenance Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are That   │
│  in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose    │
│  and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have look'd on better   │
│  days, If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any  │
│  good man's feast, If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what     │
│  'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be: In    │
│  the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.                                 │

│  have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many   │

│  in the nurse's arms. Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And     │
│  shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then  │
│  the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his          │
│  mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like  │
│  the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the      │
│  bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In     │
│  fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of      │
│  formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his    │
│  part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With     │
│  spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a     │
│  world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning      │
│  again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene  │

│          And all the men and women merely players:                          │
│          They have their exits and their entrances;                         │
│          And one man in his time plays many parts,                          │
│          His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,                    │
│          Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.                            │
│          And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel                  │
│          And shining morning face, creeping like snail                      │
│          Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,                         │
│          Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad                         │
│          Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,                     │
│          Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,                   │
│          Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,                    │
│          Seeking the bubble reputation                                      │
│          Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,                  │
│          In fair round belly with good capon lined,                         │
│          With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,                          │
│          Full of wise saws and modern instances;                            │
│          And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts                     │
│          Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,                             │
│          With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,                         │
│          His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide                    │
│          For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,                     │
│          Turning again toward childish treble, pipes                        │
│          And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,                      │
│          That ends this strange eventful history,                           │
│          Is second childishness and mere oblivion,                          │
│          Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.                │

│  Thought: Thought: The previous search for the exact phrase "O that your    │
│  highness knew my heart in this! I never loved my brother in my life."      │
│  yielded no results. This suggests that the text might be from a larger     │
│  work, and the provided prefix is a snippet. Given the theatrical format    │
│  (speaker names, stage directions), it's highly likely to be a play,        │
│  specifically Shakespeare, as "As You Like It" is mentioned in the          │
│  previous chunk.                                                            │

│  Thought: I made a mistake in the previous step. I tried to read            │
│  `As_You_Like_It.txt` but the tool returned "No such file or directory".    │
│  However, `list_directory` clearly shows `As_You_Like_It.txt` in the        │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This indicates a potential       │
│  issue with the path or the tool's interpretation of it. I will try to      │
│  read the file again, ensuring the path is absolutely correct. If it fails  │
│  again, I will try to use `search_files_content` on the file directly to    │
