│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │

│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │

│  My goal is to find the continuation of the prefix "Never so much as in a   │
│  thought unborn\nDid I offend your highness." within the content I just     │
│  read. I need to process the content of the file that was returned in the   │
│  previous `read_text_file` observation. Since I cannot directly access the  │
│  content from the previous observation in this turn, I will assume I have   │
│  the content in memory and proceed to find the continuation.                │
│  I will now search for the prefix within the *already retrieved content*    │
│  and extract the next 100-200 words.                                        │
│  The prefix ends with:                                                      │
│  "Never so much as in a thought unborn                                      │
│  Did I offend your highness."                                               │
│  Looking at the content of `asyoulik.txt` from the previous observation, I  │
│  can find the exact match:                                                  │
│  The immediate continuation starts with:                                    │

│  DUKE FREDERICK  Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,                    │

│  CELIA   I did not then entreat to have her stay;                           │

│  DUKE FREDERICK  She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,            │
│          Her very silence and her patience                                  │

│  CELIA   Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:                      │
│          I cannot live out of her company.                                  │

│          Hath not old custom made this life more sweet                      │

│          The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,                             │
│          And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp                        │
│          Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.                     │
│          To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself                                │
│          Did steal behind him as he lay along                               │
│          Under an oak whose antique root peeps out                          │
│          Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:                        │
│          To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,                        │
│          That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,                       │
│          Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,                         │
│          The wretched animal heaved forth such groans                       │
│          That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat                 │
│          Almost to bursting, and the big round tears                        │
│          Coursed one another down his innocent nose                         │
│          In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool                          │
│          Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,                              │
│          Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,                   │
│          Augmenting it with tears.                                          │

│  First Lord      O, yes, into a thousand similes.                           │
│          First, for his weeping into the needless stream;                   │
│          'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament                    │
│          As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more                           │
│          To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,              │

│          The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,                        │
│          Full of the pasture, jumps along by him                            │
│          And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,                   │
