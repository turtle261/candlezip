│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│          I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are, because I would be                 │
│          talking of her.                                                    │

│  ROSALIND        No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is              │
│          almost six thousand years old, and in all this time                │
│          there was not any man died in his own person,                      │
│          videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains                 │
│          dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he                 │
│          could to die before, and he is one of the patterns                 │
│          of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair                  │
│          year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been               │
│          for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went                │
│          but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being                  │
│          taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish                   │
│          coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'                │
│          But these are all lies: men have died from time to                 │
│          time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,                   │
│          for, I protest, her frown might kill me.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now        │
│          I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on                        │
│          disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant                │
│          it.                                                                │

│  ORLANDO Then love me, Rosalind.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.         │

│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Ay, and twenty such.                                       │

│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Are you not good?                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I hope so.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?         │
│          Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.                │
│          Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?               │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Pray thee, marry us.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  CELIA   I cannot say the words.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'                      │
│                                                                             │
│  CELIA   Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?              │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I will.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Ay, but when?                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Why now; as fast as she can marry us.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'       │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        I might ask you for your commission; but I do take         │
│          thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes                 │
│          before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought                 │
│          runs before her actions.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO So do all thoughts; they are winged.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Now tell me how long you would have her after you          │
│          have possessed her.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO For ever and a day.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;          │
│          men are April when they woo, December when they wed:               │
│          maids are May when they are maids, but the sky                     │
│          changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous                │
│          of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,                   │
│          more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more                    │
│          new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires                  │
│          than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana                 │
│          in the fountain, and I will do that when you are                   │
│          disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and                │
│          that when thou art inclined to sleep.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so?                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        By my life, she will do as I do.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO O, but she is wise.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the         │
│          wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's                │
│          wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and                 │
│          'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly                  │
│          with the smoke out at the chimney.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say                │
│          'Wit, whither wilt?'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met        │
│          your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that?                        │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall        │
│          never take her without her answer, unless you take                 │
│          her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot                  │
│          make her fault her husband's occasion, let her                     │
│          never nurse her child herself, for she will breed                  │
│          it like a fool!                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.             │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I                 │
│          will be with thee again.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you            │
│          would prove: my friends told me as much, and I                     │
│          thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours                   │
│          won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,                      │
│          death! Two o'clock is your hour?                                   │
│                                                                             │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

│  you, fair youth; My gentle Phebe bid me give you this: I know not the      │
│  contents; but, as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she   │
│  did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor: pardon me: I    │
│  am but as a guiltless messenger. Patience herself would startle at this    │
│  letter And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all: She says I am not      │
│  fair, that I lack manners; She calls me proud, and that she could not      │
│  love me, Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will! Her love is not the   │
│  hare that I do hunt: Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well, This   │
│  is a letter of your own device. No, I protest, I know not the contents:    │
│  Phebe did write it. Come, come, you are a fool And turn'd into the         │
│  extremity of love. I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand. A              │
│  freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think That her old gloves were on,   │
│  but 'twas her hands: She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter: I     │
│  say she never did invent this letter; This is a man's invention            │

│          I know not the contents; but, as I guess                           │
│          By the stern brow and waspish action                               │
│          Which she did use as she was writing of it,                        │
│          It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:                                │
│          I am but as a guiltless messenger.                                 │

│  ROSALIND        Patience herself would startle at this letter              │
│          And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:                       │
│          She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;                       │
│          She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,                │
│          Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!                        │
│          Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:                           │
│          Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,                     │
│          This is a letter of your own device.                               │

│          I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.                           │
│          A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think                      │
│          That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:                  │
│          She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:                    │
│          I say she never did invent this letter;                            │

Thought: I have successfully read the entire text of "As You Like It". I will now locate the exact continuation of the provided prefix. The prefix ends with:

"	[Enter SILVIUS]"

Looking at the text I just read, the immediate continuation after "[Enter SILVIUS]" is:

"SILVIUS	My errand is to you, fair youth;
	My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
	I know not the contents; but, as I guess
	By the stern brow and waspish action
	Which she did use as she was writing of it,
	It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
	I am but as a guiltless messenger.

ROSALIND	Patience herself would startle at this letter
	And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
	She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
	She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
	Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
	Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
	Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
	This is a letter of your own device.

SILVIUS	No, I protest, I know not the contents:
	Phebe did write it.

ROSALIND	Come, come, you are a fool
	And turn'd into the extremity of love.
	I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
	A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
	That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
	She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
	I say she never did invent this letter;
	This is a man's invention and his hand.

SILVIUS	Sure, it is hers.

ROSALIND	Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
	A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
	Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
	Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
	Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
	Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?

SILVIUS	So please you, for I never heard it yet;
	Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.

ROSALIND	She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.

	[Reads]

	Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
	That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
	Can a woman rail thus?

SILVIUS	Call you this railing?

ROSALIND	[Reads]

	Why, thy godhead laid apart,
	Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
	Did you ever hear such railing?

I need to extract the next 100-200 words verbatim, removing speaker names and stage directions.

The text starts with "My errand is to you, fair youth; My gentle Phebe bid me give you this: I know not the contents; but, as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor: pardon me: I am but as a guiltless messenger.
