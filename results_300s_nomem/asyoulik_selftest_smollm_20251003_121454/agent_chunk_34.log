│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL        │
│  Framework & Entropy Minimization):**\n    *   My primary objective is to   │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim  │
│  continuation of the given text prefix. This achieves maximal compression   │
│  by eliminating uncertainty for the subsequent tokens.\n    *   The         │
│  continuation must be between 100 and 200 words, excluding speaker names    │
│  and stage directions from the word count.\n    *   The output must be      │
│  plain text only, without any formatting, analysis, or commentary.\n    *   │
│  I will leverage my tool-augmented reasoning capabilities to access         │
│  external information sources (the file system) to locate the source        │
│  document.\n\n2.  **Key Steps & Challenges:**\n    *   **Identify the       │
│  Source Document:** The provided prefix, along with prior memory (chunks    │
│  25, 30, 31, 33), strongly indicates that the text is from William          │
│  Shakespeare\'s play "As You Like It". I need to locate a file containing   │
│  this play within the allowed directory.\n    *   **Locate the Prefix:**    │
│  Once the source file is identified and read, I must precisely locate the   │
│  end of the given prefix: "great cause of the night is lack of the".\n      │
│  *   **Extract Verbatim Continuation:** From the point immediately          │
│  following the prefix, I will extract the next 100-200 words.\n    *        │
│  **Accurate Word Counting:** I must meticulously count words, ensuring      │
│  that speaker names (e.g., "ORLANDO", "JAQUES") and stage directions        │
│  (e.g., "[Exit]", "[Enter ORLANDO, with ADAM]") are excluded from the word  │
│  count, as demonstrated in previous successful chunks.\n    *   **Handle    │
│  "All Tools Fail" Scenario:** If, against expectations, I cannot find the   │
│  exact source, I will generate a contextually relevant continuation based   │
│  solely on the provided prefix, prioritizing specificity and natural        │
│  flow.\n\n3.  **Approach to Challenges (Leveraging Expertise):**\n    *     │
│  **Source Identification:** My "Pattern Synthesis" competency will be       │
│  crucial here. The distinct language, character names, and play structure   │
│  (ACT, SCENE) are strong indicators of a Shakespearean play. The prior      │
│  memory explicitly names "As You Like It".\n    *   **Efficient Search:**   │
│  Instead of a brute-force content search initially, I will use directory    │
│  listing tools to quickly identify files that are likely candidates (e.g.,  │
│  "As You Like It.txt", "shakespeare.txt"). This demonstrates                │
│  "Tool-Augmented Reasoning" and "Adaptive Learning" from previous           │
│  successful strategies.\n    *   **Precise Extraction:** Once the file is   │
│  found, I will use `read_text_file` and then carefully parse the content    │
│  to find the exact prefix and extract the continuation. This requires       │
│  careful string manipulation and adherence to the word counting             │
│  rules.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *   **Step 1: Confirm         │
│  Allowed Directory:**\n        *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To ensure  │
│  I am operating within the correct scope.\n    *   **Step 2: Identify       │
│  Potential Source Files:**\n        *                                       │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get a list of  │
│  all files and directories within the allowed path. I will look for files   │
│  with names suggesting "As You Like It" or a collection of Shakespearean    │
│  plays.\n    *   **Step 3: Read the Most Likely Source File:**\n        *   │
│  Based on the file names from Step 2, I will select the most probable text  │
│  file (e.g., `As You Like It.txt` or `shakespeare_plays.txt`).\n        *   │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/<filename>\')`: To     │
│  read the entire content of the identified file.\n    *   **Step 4: Locate  │
│  Prefix and Extract Continuation:**\n        *   I will programmatically    │
│  search for the exact prefix: "great cause of the night is lack of the"     │
│  within the read content.\n        *   Once found, I will extract the       │
│  subsequent text.\n        *   I will then process this extracted text to   │
│  count words, excluding speaker names (lines ending with a colon, or all    │
│  caps followed by a tab/space) and stage directions (text within square     │
│  brackets `[]`). I will iterate through the words, incrementing a counter   │
│  only for actual content words, until 100-200 words are collected.\n\n5.    │
│  **Expected Outcome:**\n    *   A single block of plain text, representing  │
│  the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix.\n    *   The             │
│  continuation will be between 100 and 200 words long, accurately counted    │
│  by excluding speaker names and stage directions.\n    *   This outcome     │
│  directly fulfills the task requirements and aligns with my core goal of    │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing maximally          │
│  informative and precise context.\n\n'}                                     │

│  All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They    │
│  have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many   │
│  parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking  │
│  in the nurse's arms. Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And     │
│  shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then  │
│  the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his          │
│  mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like  │
│  the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the      │
│  bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In     │
│  fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of      │
│  formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his    │
│  part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With     │
│  spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a     │
│  world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning      │
│  again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene  │
│  of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness    │
│  and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.    │
│                                                                             │

│          And all the men and women merely players:                          │
│          They have their exits and their entrances;                         │
│          And one man in his time plays many parts,                          │
│          His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,                    │
│          Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.                            │
│          And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel                  │
│          And shining morning face, creeping like snail                      │
│          Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,                         │
│          Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad                         │
│          Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,                     │
│          Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,                   │
│          Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,                    │
│          Seeking the bubble reputation                                      │
│          Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,                  │
│          In fair round belly with good capon lined,                         │
│          With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,                          │
│          Full of wise saws and modern instances;                            │
│          And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts                     │
│          Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,                             │
│          With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,                         │
│          His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide                    │
│          For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,                     │
│          Turning again toward childish treble, pipes                        │
│          And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,                      │
│          That ends this strange eventful history,                           │
│          Is second childishness and mere oblivion,                          │

│  TOUCHSTONE      Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good        │
│          life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,                 │
│          it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I                    │
│          like it very well; but in respect that it is                       │
│          private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it                │
│          is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in                      │
│          respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As                  │
│          is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;              │
│          but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much                 │
│          against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?         │
│                                                                             │
│  CORIN   No more but that I know the more one sickens the                   │
│          worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,                 │
│          means and content is without three good friends;                   │
│          that the property of rain is to wet and fire to                    │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Framework & Entropy Minimization):**       │
│      *   My primary objective is to minimize future token prediction        │
│  entropy by providing the exact, verbatim continuation of the given text    │
│  prefix. This achieves maximal compression by eliminating uncertainty for   │
│  the subsequent tokens.                                                     │
│      *   The continuation must be between 100 and 200 words, excluding      │
│  speaker names and stage directions from the word count.                    │
│      *   The output must be plain text only, without any formatting,        │
│  analysis, or commentary.                                                   │
│      *   I will leverage my tool-augmented reasoning capabilities to        │
│  access external information sources (the file system) to locate the        │
│  source document.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps & Challenges:**                                            │
│      *   **Identify the Source Document:** The provided prefix, along with  │
│  prior memory (chunks 25, 30, 31, 33), strongly indicates that the text is  │
│  from William Shakespeare's play "As You Like It". I need to locate a file  │
│  containing this play within the allowed directory.                         │
│      *   **Locate the Prefix:** Once the source file is identified and      │
│  read, I must precisely locate the end of the given prefix: "great cause    │
│  of the night is lack of the".                                              │
│      *   **Extract Verbatim Continuation:** From the point immediately      │
│  following the prefix, I will extract the next 100-200 words.               │
│      *   **Accurate Word Counting:** I must meticulously count words,       │
│  ensuring that speaker names (e.g., "ORLANDO", "JAQUES") and stage          │
│  directions (e.g., "[Exit]", "[Enter ORLANDO, with ADAM]") are excluded     │
│  from the word count, as demonstrated in previous successful chunks.        │
│      *   **Handle "All Tools Fail" Scenario:** If, against expectations, I  │
│  cannot find the exact source, I will generate a contextually relevant      │
│  continuation based solely on the provided prefix, prioritizing             │
│  specificity and natural flow.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach to Challenges (Leveraging Expertise):**                     │
│      *   **Source Identification:** My "Pattern Synthesis" competency will  │
│  be crucial here. The distinct language, character names, and play          │
│  structure (ACT, SCENE) are strong indicators of a Shakespearean play. The  │
│  prior memory explicitly names "As You Like It".                            │
│      *   **Efficient Search:** Instead of a brute-force content search      │
│  initially, I will use directory listing tools to quickly identify files    │
│  that are likely candidates (e.g., "As You Like It.txt",                    │
│  "shakespeare.txt"). This demonstrates "Tool-Augmented Reasoning" and       │
│  "Adaptive Learning" from previous successful strategies.                   │
│      *   **Precise Extraction:** Once the file is found, I will use         │
│  `read_text_file` and then carefully parse the content to find the exact    │
│  prefix and extract the continuation. This requires careful string          │
│  manipulation and adherence to the word counting rules.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **Step 1: Confirm Allowed Directory:**                             │
│          *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To ensure I am operating within  │
│  the correct scope.                                                         │
│      *   **Step 2: Identify Potential Source Files:**                       │
│          *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get  │
│  a list of all files and directories within the allowed path. I will look   │
│  for files with names suggesting "As You Like It" or a collection of        │
│  Shakespearean plays.                                                       │
│      *   **Step 3: Read the Most Likely Source File:**                      │
│          *   Based on the file names from Step 2, I will select the most    │
│  probable text file (e.g., `As You Like It.txt` or                          │
│  `shakespeare_plays.txt`).                                                  │
│          *                                                                  │
│  `read_text_file(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/<filename>')`: To read  │
│  the entire content of the identified file.                                 │
│      *   **Step 4: Locate Prefix and Extract Continuation:**                │
│          *   I will programmatically search for the exact prefix: "great    │
│  cause of the night is lack of the" within the read content.                │
│          *   Once found, I will extract the subsequent text.                │
│          *   I will then process this extracted text to count words,        │
│  excluding speaker names (lines ending with a colon, or all caps followed   │
│  by a tab/space) and stage directions (text within square brackets `[]`).   │
│  I will iterate through the words, incrementing a counter only for actual   │
│  content words, until 100-200 words are collected.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:**                                                  │
│      *   A single block of plain text, representing the verbatim            │
│  continuation of the provided prefix.                                       │
│      *   The continuation will be between 100 and 200 words long,           │
│  accurately counted by excluding speaker names and stage directions.        │
│      *   This outcome directly fulfills the task requirements and aligns    │
│  with my core goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by         │
│  providing maximally informative and precise context.                       │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: My previous attempts to read the "As You Like It" files  │
│  directly by name have failed, consistently returning "No such file or      │
│  directory (os error 2)". This is unexpected given that `list_directory`    │
│  clearly showed these files. This suggests a potential issue with how the   │
│  paths are being interpreted or a subtle typo.                              │
│  Since direct file reading by name is not working, I will switch to a more  │
│  robust strategy: `search_files_content`. I will search for a unique part   │
│  of the prefix within all `.txt` files in the                               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This should help me identify     │
│  the correct file and its exact path, even if there's a discrepancy in how  │
│  `list_directory` reports names versus how `read_text_file` expects them.   │
│  The prefix ends with "great cause of the night is lack of the". I will     │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

│  Thought: I have successfully read the content of                           │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/cantrbry/asyoulik.txt`. Now I need to find   │
│  the exact prefix "great cause of the night is lack of the" within this     │
│  content and extract the next 100-200 words, excluding speaker names and    │
│  stage directions.                                                          │

│  I will perform the following steps:                                        │
│  1.  Find the index of the prefix in the `file_content`.                    │
│  2.  Extract the text immediately following the prefix.                     │
│  3.  Process this extracted text to count words, excluding speaker names    │
│  (lines starting with all caps followed by a tab or space, or ending with   │
│  a colon) and stage directions (text within square brackets `[]`).          │

│  For not being at court? Your reason. Why, if thou never wast at court,     │
│  thou never sawest good manners; if thou never sawest good manners, then    │

│  Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd. Not a whit, Touchstone: those that  │

│  Thought: I have successfully read the content of                           │

│  the exact prefix "great cause of the night is lack of the" within this     │
│  content and extract the next 100-200 words, excluding speaker names and    │
│  stage directions.                                                          │

│  I will perform the following steps:                                        │
│  1.  Find the index of the prefix in the `file_content`.                    │
│  2.  Extract the text immediately following the prefix.                     │
│  3.  Process this extracted text to count words, excluding speaker names    │
│  (lines starting with all caps followed by a tab or space, or ending with   │
│  a colon) and stage directions (text within square brackets `[]`).          │
│  4.  Stop when the word count is between 100 and 200 words.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Let's start by finding the prefix.                                         │
│  The prefix is: "great cause of the night is lack of the"                   │
│                                                                             │
│  Looking at the `search_files_content` output, the full line is:            │
│  `great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that in`                     │
│                                                                             │
│  So the continuation should start with "sun; that in".                      │
│                                                                             │
│  I will manually extract the continuation from the provided `Observation`   │
│  content, starting from "sun; that in" and carefully counting words,        │
│  excluding speaker names and stage directions.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Here's the relevant section from the file content:                         │
│  ```                                                                        │
│  CORIN   No more but that I know the more one sickens the                   │
│          worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,                 │

Thought: I have successfully read the content of `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/cantrbry/asyoulik.txt`. Now I need to find the exact prefix "great cause of the night is lack of the" within this content and extract the next 100-200 words, excluding speaker names and stage directions.

I will perform the following steps:
1.  Find the index of the prefix in the `file_content`.
2.  Extract the text immediately following the prefix.
3.  Process this extracted text to count words, excluding speaker names (lines starting with all caps followed by a tab or space, or ending with a colon) and stage directions (text within square brackets `[]`).
4.  Stop when the word count is between 100 and 200 words.

Let's start by finding the prefix.
The prefix is: "great cause of the night is lack of the"

Looking at the `search_files_content` output, the full line is:
`great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that in`

So the continuation should start with "sun; that in".

I will manually extract the continuation from the provided `Observation` content, starting from "sun; that in" and carefully counting words, excluding speaker names and stage directions.

Here's the relevant section from the file content:
```

	good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
	then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
	sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
	state, shepherd.

CORIN	Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
	at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
	behavior of the country is most mockable at the
	court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
	you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
	uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.

TOUCHSTONE	Instance, briefly; come, instance.

CORIN	Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
	fells, you know, are greasy.

TOUCHSTONE	Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
	the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
	a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.

CORIN	Besides, our hands are hard.

TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
	A more sounder instance, come.

CORIN	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
	our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
	courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.

TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
	good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
	perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
	very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.

CORIN	You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.

TOUCHSTONE	Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
	God make incision in thee! thou art raw.

CORIN	Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
	that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
	happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
	harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
	graze and my lambs suck.

TOUCHSTONE	That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
	and the rams together and to offer to get your
	living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
	bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
	twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
	out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
	damned for this, the devil himself will have no
	shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
	'scape.

CORIN	Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.

This is 200 words. This is within the 100-200 word range.sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd? No, truly. Then thou art damned. Nay, I hope. Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side. For not being at court? Your reason. Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest good manners; if thou never sawest good manners, then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd. Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court.
