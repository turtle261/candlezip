│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Task Understanding:** My primary  │
│  objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the  │
│  exact, verbatim continuation of the given text prefix. This involves       │
│  locating the source document, which appears to be Shakespeare\'s "As You   │
│  Like It," and extracting 100-200 words immediately following the prefix    │
│  "So be sure". The output must be plain text only, without any additional   │
│  formatting or commentary.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    *   Confirm access to  │
│  the allowed directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    *   List the    │
│  contents of the directory to identify potential source files.\n    *       │
│  Utilize `search_files_content` to efficiently locate the exact prefix "So  │
│  be sure" within the identified source file(s).\n    *   Once the           │
│  prefix\'s location is pinpointed, read the file from that point to         │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    *   Carefully count the words   │
│  to ensure the continuation falls within the specified range, including     │
│  speaker names and stage directions if they are part of the continuous      │
│  text.\n    *   Present the extracted text as plain text, adhering          │
│  strictly to the output requirements.\n\n3. **Addressing Challenges:**\n    │
│  *   **File Identification:** Given the context of previous chunks, it is   │
│  highly probable that a file containing "As You Like It" exists in the      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. `list_directory` will help       │
│  confirm this.\n    *   **Precise Location:** The `search_files_content`    │
│  tool is ideal for finding the exact string "So be sure" within the files,  │
│  which will be crucial for accurate extraction.\n    *   **Word Count       │
│  Accuracy:** I will manually count the words after extraction to ensure it  │
│  meets the 100-200 word requirement. I will treat speaker names and stage   │
│  directions as part of the word count if they are present in the verbatim   │
│  continuation.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                       │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To verify the accessible directory.\n    *   │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To inspect the    │
│  contents of the sink directory and identify potential source files (e.g.,  │
│  a text file named "as_you_like_it.txt" or similar).\n    *                 │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'So    │
│  be sure\')`: This is the most critical tool. It will pinpoint the exact    │
│  file and location of the prefix, allowing for precise extraction.\n    *   │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'[identified_file_path]\')`: Once the file is        │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read the content from the point of   │
│  the prefix onwards. I will then manually extract and count the             │
│  words.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a plain text    │
│  block of 100-200 words, representing the exact continuation of the         │
│  provided prefix from Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It". This precise output  │
│  will directly contribute to minimizing future token prediction entropy by  │
│  providing highly accurate and contextually rich information to the         │
│  language model.'}                                                          │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Task Understanding:** My primary objective is to minimize future      │
│  token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim continuation of  │
│  the given text prefix. This involves locating the source document, which   │
│  appears to be Shakespeare's "As You Like It," and extracting 100-200       │
│  words immediately following the prefix "So be sure". The output must be    │
│  plain text only, without any additional formatting or commentary.          │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   Confirm access to the allowed directory                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                                            │
│      *   List the contents of the directory to identify potential source    │
│  files.                                                                     │
│      *   Utilize `search_files_content` to efficiently locate the exact     │
│  prefix "So be sure" within the identified source file(s).                  │
│      *   Once the prefix's location is pinpointed, read the file from that  │
│  point to extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                             │
│      *   Carefully count the words to ensure the continuation falls within  │
│  the specified range, including speaker names and stage directions if they  │
│  are part of the continuous text.                                           │
│      *   Present the extracted text as plain text, adhering strictly to     │
│  the output requirements.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Addressing Challenges:**                                              │
│      *   **File Identification:** Given the context of previous chunks, it  │
│  is highly probable that a file containing "As You Like It" exists in the   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. `list_directory` will help       │
│  confirm this.                                                              │
│      *   **Precise Location:** The `search_files_content` tool is ideal     │
│  for finding the exact string "So be sure" within the files, which will be  │
│  crucial for accurate extraction.                                           │
│      *   **Word Count Accuracy:** I will manually count the words after     │
│  extraction to ensure it meets the 100-200 word requirement. I will treat   │
│  speaker names and stage directions as part of the word count if they are   │
│  present in the verbatim continuation.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To verify the accessible directory.  │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To inspect  │
│  the contents of the sink directory and identify potential source files     │
│  (e.g., a text file named "as_you_like_it.txt" or similar).                 │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='So be sure')`: This is the most critical tool. It will pinpoint     │
│  the exact file and location of the prefix, allowing for precise            │
│  extraction.                                                                │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='[identified_file_path]')`: Once the file is  │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read the content from the point of   │
│  the prefix onwards. I will then manually extract and count the words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a plain text block of     │
│  100-200 words, representing the exact continuation of the provided prefix  │
│  from Shakespeare's "As You Like It". This precise output will directly     │
│  contribute to minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing      │
│  highly accurate and contextually rich information to the language model.   │
│                                                                             │

│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Understanding of the Task         │
│  (Entropy Minimization):** My core objective is to minimize future token    │
│  prediction entropy by providing the most accurate and information-dense    │
│  continuation of the given text prefix. This means locating the exact       │
│  source document, extracting the verbatim text immediately following the    │
│  prefix "So be sure", and ensuring the extracted continuation is between    │
│  100 and 200 words. The output must be pure plain text, devoid of any       │
│  formatting, analysis, or meta-commentary, to maximize its utility as a     │
│  direct predictive hint.\n\n2. **Key Steps for Completion:**\n    *         │
│  **Directory Verification:** Confirm access to the specified                │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory using                             │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`.\n    *   **File Identification:** List the   │
│  contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory using             │
│  `list_directory()` to identify the most probable source file containing    │
│  "As You Like It".\n    *   **Prefix Location:** Employ                     │
│  `search_files_content()` to precisely locate the string "So be sure"       │
│  within the identified source file. This will provide the exact starting    │
│  point for extraction.\n    *   **Content Extraction:** Read the content    │
│  of the identified file using `read_text_file()` from the point             │
│  immediately following the prefix.\n    *   **Word Counting and             │
│  Selection:** Carefully parse the extracted text, counting words to ensure  │
│  the continuation falls within the 100-200 word range. Speaker names and    │
│  stage directions will be included in the word count if they are part of    │
│  the continuous flow of the text.\n    *   **Final Output Generation:**     │
│  Present the selected continuation as plain text, strictly adhering to the  │
│  output requirements.\n\n3. **Approach to Potential Challenges:**\n    *    │
│  **File Ambiguity:** If `list_directory()` reveals multiple potential       │
│  source files, I will prioritize files with names strongly suggesting "As   │
│  You Like It" (e.g., "as_you_like_it.txt", "shakespeare.txt"). If still     │
│  ambiguous, I will use `search_files_content` on the most likely            │
│  candidates.\n    *   **Precise Prefix Matching:** `search_files_content`   │
│  is designed for exact string matching, which will mitigate issues with     │
│  partial matches.\n    *   **Accurate Word Count:** After extracting a      │
│  sufficiently large block of text following the prefix, I will              │
│  programmatically or manually count words, ensuring that the final          │
│  selection is within the 100-200 word range. I will be mindful of           │
│  punctuation and speaker tags when counting.\n    *   **Output Format       │
│  Compliance:** I will ensure the final output is a raw string, stripped of  │
│  any markdown, newlines (unless part of the original text flow), or other   │
│  non-content elements.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *               │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the                               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory is accessible.\n    *             │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get a list of  │
│  files in the target directory. This will help me identify the specific     │
│  file containing the play.\n    *                                           │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'So    │
│  be sure\')`: This is the most critical tool. It will efficiently locate    │
│  the file and the exact position of the prefix, which is essential for      │
│  precise extraction. I will use the path returned by `list_directory` for   │
│  this.\n    *   `read_text_file(path=\'[identified_file_path]\')`: Once     │
│  the file containing the prefix is identified, I will use this tool to      │
│  read its entire content. This allows for flexible parsing to extract the   │

│  **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a single block of plain      │

│  1. **Understanding of the Task (Entropy Minimization):** My core           │
│  objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the  │
│  most accurate and information-dense continuation of the given text         │
│  prefix. This means locating the exact source document, extracting the      │
│  verbatim text immediately following the prefix "So be sure", and ensuring  │
│  the extracted continuation is between 100 and 200 words. The output must   │
│  be pure plain text, devoid of any formatting, analysis, or                 │
│  meta-commentary, to maximize its utility as a direct predictive hint.      │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps for Completion:**                                           │
│      *   **Directory Verification:** Confirm access to the specified        │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory using                             │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`.                                              │
│      *   **File Identification:** List the contents of the                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory using `list_directory()` to       │
│  identify the most probable source file containing "As You Like It".        │
│      *   **Prefix Location:** Employ `search_files_content()` to precisely  │
│  locate the string "So be sure" within the identified source file. This     │
│  will provide the exact starting point for extraction.                      │
│      *   **Content Extraction:** Read the content of the identified file    │
│  using `read_text_file()` from the point immediately following the prefix.  │
│      *   **Word Counting and Selection:** Carefully parse the extracted     │
│  text, counting words to ensure the continuation falls within the 100-200   │
│  word range. Speaker names and stage directions will be included in the     │
│  word count if they are part of the continuous flow of the text.            │
│      *   **Final Output Generation:** Present the selected continuation as  │
│  plain text, strictly adhering to the output requirements.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Potential Challenges:**                                   │
│      *   **File Ambiguity:** If `list_directory()` reveals multiple         │
│  potential source files, I will prioritize files with names strongly        │
│  suggesting "As You Like It" (e.g., "as_you_like_it.txt",                   │
│  "shakespeare.txt"). If still ambiguous, I will use `search_files_content`  │
│  on the most likely candidates.                                             │
│      *   **Precise Prefix Matching:** `search_files_content` is designed    │
│  for exact string matching, which will mitigate issues with partial         │
│  matches.                                                                   │
│      *   **Accurate Word Count:** After extracting a sufficiently large     │
│  block of text following the prefix, I will programmatically or manually    │
│  count words, ensuring that the final selection is within the 100-200 word  │
│  range. I will be mindful of punctuation and speaker tags when counting.    │
│      *   **Output Format Compliance:** I will ensure the final output is a  │
│  raw string, stripped of any markdown, newlines (unless part of the         │
│  original text flow), or other non-content elements.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the                       │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory is accessible.                    │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get a    │
│  list of files in the target directory. This will help me identify the      │
│  specific file containing the play.                                         │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='So be sure')`: This is the most critical tool. It will efficiently  │
│  locate the file and the exact position of the prefix, which is essential   │
│  for precise extraction. I will use the path returned by `list_directory`   │
│  for this.                                                                  │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='[identified_file_path]')`: Once the file     │
│  containing the prefix is identified, I will use this tool to read its      │
│  entire content. This allows for flexible parsing to extract the exact      │
│  continuation, even if the prefix is in the middle of a line.               │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a single block of plain   │

│                                                                             │

│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │

│  This is 196 words, which is within the 100-200 word range. I will use      │
│  this as the final answer.to the sweet bird's throat, Come hither, come     │
│  hither, come hither: Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough       │
│  weather. More, more, I prithee, more. It will make you melancholy,         │
│  Monsieur Jaques. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy  │
│  out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. My voice is  │
│  ragged: I know I cannot please you. I do not desire you to please me; I    │
│  do desire you to sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?   │
│  What you will, Monsieur Jaques. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe  │
│  me nothing. Will you sing? More at your request than to please myself.     │
│  Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call     │
│  compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks    │
│  me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the       │
│  beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.     │
│  Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under  │

│  down and feed, and welcome to our table. Speak you so gently? Pardon me,   │
│  I pray you: I thought that all things had been savage here; And therefore  │
│  put I on the countenance Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are That   │
│  in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose    │
│  and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have look'd on better   │
│  days, If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any  │
│  good man's feast, If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what     │
│  'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be: In    │
│  the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.                                 │

│  All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They    │
│  have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many   │
│  parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking  │
│  in the nurse's arms. Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And     │
│  shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then  │
│  the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his          │
│  mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like  │
│  the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the      │
│  bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In     │
│  fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of      │
│  formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his    │
│  part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With     │
│  spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a     │
│  world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning      │
│  again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene  │
│  of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness    │
│  and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.    │
│                                                                             │

│  CORIN   No more but that I know the more one sickens the                   │
│          worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,                 │

│          that the property of rain is to wet and fire to                    │

│  TOUCHSTONE      Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest        │
│          good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,                   │
│          then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is                 │
│          sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous                   │

│  CORIN   Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners                │
│          at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the               │
│          behavior of the country is most mockable at the                    │
│          court. You told me you salute not at the court, but                │
│          you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be                        │

│  CORIN   And they are often tarred over with the surgery of                 │
│          our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The                     │

│  CORIN   Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get                  │
│          that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's                        │
│          happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my               │
│          harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes               │
│          graze and my lambs suck.                                           │

│  TOUCHSTONE      That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes       │
│          and the rams together and to offer to get your                     │
│          living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a                │

│  1. **Task Understanding:** My primary objective is to minimize future      │
│  token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim continuation of  │
│  the given text prefix. This involves locating the source document, which   │
│  appears to be Shakespeare's "As You Like It," and extracting 100-200       │
│  words immediately following the prefix "So be sure". The output must be    │
│  plain text only, without any additional formatting or commentary.          │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   Confirm access to the allowed directory                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                                            │
│      *   List the contents of the directory to identify potential source    │
│  files.                                                                     │
│      *   Utilize `search_files_content` to efficiently locate the exact     │
│  prefix "So be sure" within the identified source file(s).                  │
│      *   Once the prefix's location is pinpointed, read the file from that  │
│  point to extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                             │
│      *   Carefully count the words to ensure the continuation falls within  │
│  the specified range, including speaker names and stage directions if they  │
│  are part of the continuous text.                                           │
│      *   Present the extracted text as plain text, adhering strictly to     │
│  the output requirements.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Addressing Challenges:**                                              │
│      *   **File Identification:** Given the context of previous chunks, it  │
│  is highly probable that a file containing "As You Like It" exists in the   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. `list_directory` will help       │
│  confirm this.                                                              │
│      *   **Precise Location:** The `search_files_content` tool is ideal     │
│  for finding the exact string "So be sure" within the files, which will be  │
│  crucial for accurate extraction.                                           │
│      *   **Word Count Accuracy:** I will manually count the words after     │
│  extraction to ensure it meets the 100-200 word requirement. I will treat   │
│  speaker names and stage directions as part of the word count if they are   │
│  present in the verbatim continuation.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To verify the accessible directory.  │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To inspect  │
│  the contents of the sink directory and identify potential source files     │
│  (e.g., a text file named "as_you_like_it.txt" or similar).                 │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='So be sure')`: This is the most critical tool. It will pinpoint     │
│  the exact file and location of the prefix, allowing for precise            │
│  extraction.                                                                │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='[identified_file_path]')`: Once the file is  │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read the content from the point of   │
│  the prefix onwards. I will then manually extract and count the words.      │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a plain text block of     │
│  100-200 words, representing the exact continuation of the provided prefix  │
│  from Shakespeare's "As You Like It". This precise output will directly     │

│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understanding of the Task (Entropy Minimization):** My core           │
│  objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the  │
│  most accurate and information-dense continuation of the given text         │
│  prefix. This means locating the exact source document, extracting the      │
│  verbatim text immediately following the prefix "So be sure", and ensuring  │
│  the extracted continuation is between 100 and 200 words. The output must   │
│  be pure plain text, devoid of any formatting, analysis, or                 │
│  meta-commentary, to maximize its utility as a direct predictive hint.      │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps for Completion:**                                           │
│      *   **Directory Verification:** Confirm access to the specified        │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory using                             │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`.                                              │
│      *   **File Identification:** List the contents of the                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory using `list_directory()` to       │
│  identify the most probable source file containing "As You Like It".        │
│      *   **Prefix Location:** Employ `search_files_content()` to precisely  │
│  locate the string "So be sure" within the identified source file. This     │
│  will provide the exact starting point for extraction.                      │
│      *   **Content Extraction:** Read the content of the identified file    │
│  using `read_text_file()` from the point immediately following the prefix.  │
│      *   **Word Counting and Selection:** Carefully parse the extracted     │
│  text, counting words to ensure the continuation falls within the 100-200   │
│  word range. Speaker names and stage directions will be included in the     │
│  word count if they are part of the continuous flow of the text.            │
│      *   **Final Output Generation:** Present the selected continuation as  │
│  plain text, strictly adhering to the output requirements.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Potential Challenges:**                                   │
│      *   **File Ambiguity:** If `list_directory()` reveals multiple         │
│  potential source files, I will prioritize files with names strongly        │
│  suggesting "As You Like It" (e.g., "as_you_like_it.txt",                   │
│  "shakespeare.txt"). If still ambiguous, I will use `search_files_content`  │
│  on the most likely candidates.                                             │
│      *   **Precise Prefix Matching:** `search_files_content` is designed    │
│  for exact string matching, which will mitigate issues with partial         │
│  matches.                                                                   │
│      *   **Accurate Word Count:** After extracting a sufficiently large     │
│  block of text following the prefix, I will programmatically or manually    │
│  count words, ensuring that the final selection is within the 100-200 word  │
│  range. I will be mindful of punctuation and speaker tags when counting.    │
│      *   **Output Format Compliance:** I will ensure the final output is a  │
│  raw string, stripped of any markdown, newlines (unless part of the         │
│  original text flow), or other non-content elements.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the                       │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory is accessible.                    │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get a    │
│  list of files in the target directory. This will help me identify the      │
│  specific file containing the play.                                         │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='So be sure')`: This is the most critical tool. It will efficiently  │
│  locate the file and the exact position of the prefix, which is essential   │
│  for precise extraction. I will use the path returned by `list_directory`   │
│  for this.                                                                  │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='[identified_file_path]')`: Once the file     │
│  containing the prefix is identified, I will use this tool to read its      │
│  entire content. This allows for flexible parsing to extract the exact      │
│  continuation, even if the prefix is in the middle of a line.               │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a single block of plain   │
│  text, comprising 100-200 words, which is the verbatim continuation of the  │
│  prefix "So be sure" from Shakespeare's "As You Like It". This highly       │
│  specific and accurate output will directly contribute to minimizing        │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing the language model with       │
│  precise, context-rich information, thereby allowing it to assign higher    │
│  probability mass to the actual upcoming tokens.                            │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: Event loop is closed.
 Tool list_directory accepts these inputs: Tool Name: list_directory
Tool Arguments: {'properties': {'path': {'anyOf': [], 'description': 'The path of the directory to list.', 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': '', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['path'], 'title': 'DynamicModel', 'type': 'object'}
Tool Description: Get a detailed listing of all files and directories in a specified path. Results clearly distinguish between files and directories with [FILE] and [DIR] prefixes. This tool is essential for understanding directory structure and finding specific files within a directory. Only works within allowed directories.
