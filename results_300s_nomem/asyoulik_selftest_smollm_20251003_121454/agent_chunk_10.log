│  Tool Args: {'ready': False, 'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL       │
│  Perspective):** The core task is to find a verbatim continuation of a      │
│  given text prefix (100-200 words) to minimize future token prediction      │
│  entropy. This directly aligns with the SIMDL framework by leveraging       │
│  external information (tools) to reduce uncertainty. The text appears to    │
│  be from a play, likely Shakespearean, which provides strong contextual     │
│  clues for searching.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    *   **Initial Directory     │
│  Analysis:** Use `list_directory_with_sizes` to inspect the                 │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory for potential source files.\n     │
│  *   **Content Search:** Employ `search_files_content` to locate the exact  │
│  prefix "ROSALIND You tell us the manner of the wrestling." within the      │
│  files. This specific line is a strong identifier for the source text.\n    │
│  *   **File Identification & Reading:** Once a file containing the prefix   │
│  is found, use `read_text_file` to retrieve its full content.\n    *        │
│  **Continuation Extraction:** Programmatically find the exact position of   │
│  the prefix in the file content and extract the subsequent 100-200          │
│  words.\n    *   **Word Count Verification:** Confirm the extracted text    │
│  falls within the specified word count range.\n    *   **Output             │
│  Generation:** Present the extracted continuation as plain text, without    │
│  any additional formatting or commentary.\n\n3. **Challenges and            │
│  Approach:**\n    *   **Locating the Source:** The primary challenge is     │
│  efficiently identifying the correct source file. The                       │
│  `search_files_content` tool is ideal for this, using a highly specific     │
│  phrase from the prefix.\n    *   **Variations in Text:** Minor             │
│  differences in formatting (e.g., line breaks, extra spaces) might affect   │
│  direct string matching. I will ensure the search query is robust.\n    *   │
│  **Precise Extraction:** Accurately extracting exactly 100-200 words        │
│  requires careful string manipulation after finding the prefix. I will      │
│  extract a slightly larger chunk and then trim it if necessary.\n\n4.       │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                                           │
│  `list_directory_with_sizes(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To     │
│  get an initial overview of the files in the allowed directory. This helps  │
│  in understanding the potential types of files I might be dealing with.\n   │
│  *   `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',           │
│  query=\'ROSALIND You tell us the manner of the wrestling.\')`: This is     │
│  the most critical tool for directly finding the document containing the    │
│  prefix. The query is specific enough to likely pinpoint the exact          │
│  source.\n    *   `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: Once        │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  read the entire content of that file for precise extraction.\n\n5.         │
│  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string containing the verbatim          │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided prefix. This outcome          │
│  directly fulfills the task requirements and contributes to entropy         │
│  minimization by providing highly accurate predictive information.\n'}      │

│  ROSALIND        Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;       │
│          and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could                 │
│          teach me to forget a banished father, you must not                 │
│          learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.               │
│                                                                             │
│  CELIA   Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight               │
│          that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,                │
│          had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou                │
│          hadst been still with me, I could have taught my                   │
│          love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,                 │
│          if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously                 │
│          tempered as mine is to thee.                                       │

│  ROSALIND        Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to         │
│          rejoice in yours.                                                  │

│  CELIA   You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is                │
│          like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt                 │
│          be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy                  │
│          father perforce, I will render thee again in                       │
│          affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break                │
│          that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my                      │
│          sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.                                │

│  ROSALIND        From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let        │
│          me see; what think you of falling in love?                         │

│  CELIA   Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but                    │
│          love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport               │
│          neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst                │
│          in honour come off again.                                          │
│                                                                             │

│  CELIA   Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from                │
│          her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.      │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        I would we could do so, for her benefits are               │
│          mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman                  │
│          doth most mistake in her gifts to women.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  CELIA   'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce                │
│          makes honest, and those that she makes honest she                  │
│          makes very ill-favouredly.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to               │
│          Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,                    │
│          not in the lineaments of Nature.                                   │

│  CELIA   No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she                 │
│          not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature                   │
│          hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not                    │
│          Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when         │
│          Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of                   │
│          Nature's wit.                                                      │

│  CELIA   Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but               │
│          Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull                 │
│          to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this                     │
│          natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of               │
│          the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,                    │
│          wit! whither wander you?                                           │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The core task is to find   │
│  a verbatim continuation of a given text prefix (100-200 words) to          │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy. This directly aligns with the    │
│  SIMDL framework by leveraging external information (tools) to reduce       │
│  uncertainty. The text appears to be from a play, likely Shakespearean,     │
│  which provides strong contextual clues for searching.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   **Initial Directory Analysis:** Use `list_directory_with_sizes`    │
│  to inspect the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory for potential      │
│  source files.                                                              │
│      *   **Content Search:** Employ `search_files_content` to locate the    │
│  exact prefix "ROSALIND You tell us the manner of the wrestling." within    │
│  the files. This specific line is a strong identifier for the source text.  │
│      *   **File Identification & Reading:** Once a file containing the      │
│  prefix is found, use `read_text_file` to retrieve its full content.        │
│      *   **Continuation Extraction:** Programmatically find the exact       │
│  position of the prefix in the file content and extract the subsequent      │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│      *   **Word Count Verification:** Confirm the extracted text falls      │
│  within the specified word count range.                                     │
│      *   **Output Generation:** Present the extracted continuation as       │
│  plain text, without any additional formatting or commentary.               │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Challenges and Approach:**                                            │
│      *   **Locating the Source:** The primary challenge is efficiently      │
│  identifying the correct source file. The `search_files_content` tool is    │
│  ideal for this, using a highly specific phrase from the prefix.            │
│      *   **Variations in Text:** Minor differences in formatting (e.g.,     │
│  line breaks, extra spaces) might affect direct string matching. I will     │
│  ensure the search query is robust.                                         │
│      *   **Precise Extraction:** Accurately extracting exactly 100-200      │
│  words requires careful string manipulation after finding the prefix. I     │
│  will extract a slightly larger chunk and then trim it if necessary.        │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_directory_with_sizes(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`:  │
│  To get an initial overview of the files in the allowed directory. This     │
│  helps in understanding the potential types of files I might be dealing     │
│  with.                                                                      │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='ROSALIND You tell us the manner of the wrestling.')`: This is the   │
│  most critical tool for directly finding the document containing the        │
│  prefix. The query is specific enough to likely pinpoint the exact source.  │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: Once                   │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  read the entire content of that file for precise extraction.               │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string containing the verbatim       │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided prefix. This outcome          │
│  directly fulfills the task requirements and contributes to entropy         │
│  minimization by providing highly accurate predictive information.          │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  subdirectories: `cantrbry`, `enwik8_samples`, and `synthetic`. Given the   │
│  nature of the text (Shakespearean play), it's highly probable that the     │

│  literature. I will now search for the specific phrase "ROSALIND You tell   │

│  You tell us the manner of the wrestling." yielded no results. This is      │

│  are slight variations in formatting (e.g., tabs vs. spaces, line breaks)   │
│  or the file is not a `.txt` file, or it's in a different subdirectory.     │
│  I will broaden my search. First, I will check the `enwik8_samples`         │
│  directory, although it's less likely for a play. Then, I will try a more   │
│  general search across all allowed directories, and if that fails, I will   │
│  try a slightly modified query, perhaps just "You tell us the manner of     │
│  the wrestling." or "ROSALIND You tell us".                                 │

│  Thought: Thought: The `directory_tree` command reveals the files within    │
│  the `cantrbry` directory. I see `asyoulik.txt`, which is very likely "As   │
│  You Like It" by Shakespeare, matching the style of the provided text.      │
│  I will now search for the prefix "ROSALIND You tell us the manner of the   │
│  wrestling." specifically within                                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/cantrbry/asyoulik.txt`. I will use           │
│  `is_regex=True` and escape special characters to ensure a precise match,   │
│  accounting for potential variations in whitespace or line endings.         │
│  However, given the previous attempts, I will first try a simpler, direct   │
│  string match, and if that fails, I will consider regex. The previous       │
│  attempts failed because I was searching for `*.txt` in the directory, not  │
│  the specific file.                                                         │

│  Thought: Thought: My previous search for "ROSALIND You tell us the manner  │

│  flexible search by removing the tab and allowing for any whitespace, and   │
│  also by trying a slightly shorter, more robust part of the phrase.         │
│  Given the prefix provided in the prompt, the line `ROSALIND You tell us    │
│  the manner of the wrestling.` has a tab character between `ROSALIND` and   │
│  `You`. I will try searching for the string with a space instead of a tab,  │
│  and also try a regex to account for any whitespace.                        │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │
