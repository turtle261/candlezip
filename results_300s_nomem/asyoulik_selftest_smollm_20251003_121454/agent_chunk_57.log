│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Analyze the prefix:** The provided text is       │
│  clearly from William Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It," identifiable by      │
│  character names (ROSALIND, ORLANDO, CELIA, JAQUES, PHEBE, SILVIUS) and     │
│  the play\'s act/scene structure. This immediately focuses the search to    │
│  this specific literary work.\n2. **Explore the allowed directory:** I      │
│  will start by listing the contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`   │
│  directory using `directory_tree` to get an overview of available files     │
│  and potential candidates for the source document.\n3. **Search for the     │
│  source document:** I will use the `search_files_content` tool to locate    │
│  the file containing the provided prefix. A highly specific phrase from     │
│  the end of the prefix, such as "I might ask you for your commission; but   │
│  I do take thee,", will be used as the query to ensure accuracy and         │
│  minimize false positives.\n4. **Extract verbatim continuation:** Once the  │
│  correct file is identified, I will use `read_text_file` to retrieve its    │
│  entire content. I will then programmatically find the exact end of the     │
│  provided prefix within the file and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.  │
│  I will ensure that speaker names and stage directions are included as      │
│  they are part of the verbatim text.\n5. **Format output:** The extracted   │
│  continuation will be presented as plain text only, without any additional  │
│  markdown, analysis, or commentary, as per the task                         │
│  requirements.\n\n**Challenges and Mitigation:**\n*   **File Naming:** If   │
│  the file is not explicitly named "As You Like It," `search_files_content`  │
│  will be crucial.\n*   **Exact Match:** The query for                       │
│  `search_files_content` needs to be precise to avoid partial matches. If    │
│  the initial query is too broad or too narrow, I will adjust it.\n*         │
│  **Word Count:** After extracting the continuation, I will verify that it   │
│  falls within the 100-200 word range. If it\'s slightly off, I will adjust  │
│  the extraction length.\n\n**Strategic Tool Usage:**\n*                     │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To survey the     │
│  available files.\n*                                                        │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'I     │
│  might ask you for your commission; but I do take thee,\')`: To pinpoint    │

│  To read the content of the identified source file for                      │
│  extraction.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\nA plain text block containing the    │
│  100-200 words immediately following the provided prefix from "As You Like  │
│  It," thereby minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the   │
│  most accurate and contextually rich continuation possible. This directly   │

│          year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been               │

│          thee,                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Analyze the prefix:** The provided text is clearly from William       │
│  Shakespeare's "As You Like It," identifiable by character names            │
│  (ROSALIND, ORLANDO, CELIA, JAQUES, PHEBE, SILVIUS) and the play's          │
│  act/scene structure. This immediately focuses the search to this specific  │
│  literary work.                                                             │
│  2. **Explore the allowed directory:** I will start by listing the          │
│  contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory using             │
│  `directory_tree` to get an overview of available files and potential       │
│  candidates for the source document.                                        │
│  3. **Search for the source document:** I will use the                      │
│  `search_files_content` tool to locate the file containing the provided     │
│  prefix. A highly specific phrase from the end of the prefix, such as "I    │
│  might ask you for your commission; but I do take thee,", will be used as   │
│  the query to ensure accuracy and minimize false positives.                 │
│  4. **Extract verbatim continuation:** Once the correct file is             │
│  identified, I will use `read_text_file` to retrieve its entire content. I  │
│  will then programmatically find the exact end of the provided prefix       │
│  within the file and extract the subsequent 100-200 words. I will ensure    │
│  that speaker names and stage directions are included as they are part of   │
│  the verbatim text.                                                         │
│  5. **Format output:** The extracted continuation will be presented as      │
│  plain text only, without any additional markdown, analysis, or             │
│  commentary, as per the task requirements.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  **Challenges and Mitigation:**                                             │
│  *   **File Naming:** If the file is not explicitly named "As You Like      │
│  It," `search_files_content` will be crucial.                               │
│  *   **Exact Match:** The query for `search_files_content` needs to be      │
│  precise to avoid partial matches. If the initial query is too broad or     │
│  too narrow, I will adjust it.                                              │
│  *   **Word Count:** After extracting the continuation, I will verify that  │
│  it falls within the 100-200 word range. If it's slightly off, I will       │
│  adjust the extraction length.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                                  │
│  *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To survey the   │
│  available files.                                                           │
│  *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='I    │
│  might ask you for your commission; but I do take thee,')`: To pinpoint     │
│  the exact source file.                                                     │
│  *   `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: To read the content of     │
│  the identified source file for extraction.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  **Expected Outcome:**                                                      │
│  A plain text block containing the 100-200 words immediately following the  │
│  provided prefix from "As You Like It," thereby minimizing future token     │
│  prediction entropy by providing the most accurate and contextually rich    │
│  continuation possible. This directly aligns with my core competency of     │
│  Entropy Minimization and Operational Strategy of extracting verbatim       │
│  continuations from identified sources.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The `directory_tree` output shows a file named           │
│  `asyoulik.txt` within the `cantrbry` directory. This is a very strong      │
│  candidate for the source document, given the prefix is from "As You Like   │
│  It." I will now use `read_text_file` to read the content of this file and  │
│  then extract the continuation.                                             │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
	before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
	runs before her actions.

ORLANDO	So do all thoughts; they are winged.

ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you
	have possessed her.

ORLANDO	For ever and a day.

ROSALIND	Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
	men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
	maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
	changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
	of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
	more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
	new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
	than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
	in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
	disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
	that when thou art inclined to sleep.

ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?

ROSALIND	By my life, she will do as I do.

ORLANDO	O, but she is wise.

ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
	wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
	wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
	'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
	with the smoke out at the chimney.
