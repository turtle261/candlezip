│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective): The task  │
│  is to find the exact continuation of a given text prefix. From a SIMDL     │
│  perspective, this means identifying the most probable next tokens by       │
│  leveraging external information (entropy sinks). If I can find the exact   │
│  source, I can provide a verbatim continuation, which offers maximum        │
│  information density and thus minimizes entropy for the subsequent tokens.  │
│  If not, I need to synthesize the most likely continuation based on         │
│  available context, still aiming for high information content. The "cost"   │
│  of accessing external information is represented by the tool usage.\n\n2.  │
│  Key Steps:\n    * Analyze the provided text prefix to identify unique      │
│  phrases, character names, and structural elements that can serve as        │
│  strong search queries. The text appears to be from a play, specifically    │
│  Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It," given the character names (Rosalind,      │
│  Celia, Oliver, Silvius, Touchstone, Audrey) and the format (speaker        │
│  names, stage directions).\n    * My primary strategy will be to search     │
│  for the full text of "As You Like It" within the allowed directory         │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    * Once the source document is found,  │
│  I will locate the exact prefix within it.\n    * Then, I will extract the  │
│  immediate continuation (100-200 words) following the prefix, removing      │
│  speaker names and stage directions as per the instructions.\n\n3.          │
│  Approach to Challenges:\n    * Challenge 1: Not finding the exact          │
│  document in the allowed directory. If a direct search for "As You Like     │
│  It" doesn\'t yield results, I will broaden my search within the directory  │
│  for any text files that contain significant portions of the prefix. I      │
│  will use `search_files_content` with distinctive phrases from the          │
│  prefix.\n    * Challenge 2: Difficulty in extracting the exact             │
│  continuation due to formatting. If the document is found but has complex   │
│  formatting, I will use `read_text_file` or `read_file_lines` and then      │
│  manually parse the text to extract the continuation, carefully removing    │
│  speaker names and stage directions.\n    * Challenge 3: No relevant files  │
│  found in the directory. If all searches within the allowed directory       │
│  fail, I will have to generate a continuation based on the context          │
│  provided in the prefix, focusing on maintaining the style, tone, and       │
│  narrative flow of Shakespearean dialogue. However, the instructions        │
│  emphasize using MCP tools aggressively, so this is a last resort.\n\n4.    │
│  Strategic Tool Usage:\n    * Initial Directory Analysis:\n        *        │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path.\n        *   │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  overview of the directory structure and potential file names. This will    │
│  help me identify likely candidates for the source text.\n    * Searching   │
│  for the Source Document:\n        *                                        │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'AS    │
│  YOU LIKE IT\')`: This is the most direct approach to find the play. I      │
│  will use the capitalized version as it appears in the prefix.\n        *   │
│  If the above fails, I will use                                             │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'Call  │
│  you this chiding?\')` or                                                   │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'A     │
│  sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?\')` or other unique phrases      │
│  from the prefix to locate relevant files.\n    * Reading the Source        │
│  Document:\n        * `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: Once a  │
│  potential source file is identified, I will read its content to locate     │
│  the prefix and extract the continuation.\n        *                        │
│  `head_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: If the file is very large, I      │
│  might use `head_file` first to get a glimpse of its content and confirm    │
│  it\'s the correct document before reading the entire file.\n\n5. Expected  │
│  Outcome:\n    * A plain text continuation of 100-200 words, extracted      │
│  verbatim from the source document, following the provided prefix.\n    *   │
│  The continuation will be free of speaker names, stage directions,          │
│  markdown, analysis, or commentary.\n    * This outcome directly aligns     │
│  with my goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing    │
│  maximally informative and precise context.', 'ready': True}                │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective): The task is to find the exact  │
│  continuation of a given text prefix. From a SIMDL perspective, this means  │
│  identifying the most probable next tokens by leveraging external           │
│  information (entropy sinks). If I can find the exact source, I can         │
│  provide a verbatim continuation, which offers maximum information density  │
│  and thus minimizes entropy for the subsequent tokens. If not, I need to    │
│  synthesize the most likely continuation based on available context, still  │
│  aiming for high information content. The "cost" of accessing external      │
│  information is represented by the tool usage.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      * Analyze the provided text prefix to identify unique phrases,         │
│  character names, and structural elements that can serve as strong search   │
│  queries. The text appears to be from a play, specifically Shakespeare's    │
│  "As You Like It," given the character names (Rosalind, Celia, Oliver,      │
│  Silvius, Touchstone, Audrey) and the format (speaker names, stage          │
│  directions).                                                               │
│      * My primary strategy will be to search for the full text of "As You   │
│  Like It" within the allowed directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.      │
│      * Once the source document is found, I will locate the exact prefix    │
│  within it.                                                                 │
│      * Then, I will extract the immediate continuation (100-200 words)      │
│  following the prefix, removing speaker names and stage directions as per   │
│  the instructions.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach to Challenges:                                                 │
│      * Challenge 1: Not finding the exact document in the allowed           │
│  directory. If a direct search for "As You Like It" doesn't yield results,  │
│  I will broaden my search within the directory for any text files that      │
│  contain significant portions of the prefix. I will use                     │
│  `search_files_content` with distinctive phrases from the prefix.           │
│      * Challenge 2: Difficulty in extracting the exact continuation due to  │
│  formatting. If the document is found but has complex formatting, I will    │
│  use `read_text_file` or `read_file_lines` and then manually parse the      │
│  text to extract the continuation, carefully removing speaker names and     │
│  stage directions.                                                          │
│      * Challenge 3: No relevant files found in the directory. If all        │
│  searches within the allowed directory fail, I will have to generate a      │
│  continuation based on the context provided in the prefix, focusing on      │
│  maintaining the style, tone, and narrative flow of Shakespearean           │
│  dialogue. However, the instructions emphasize using MCP tools              │
│  aggressively, so this is a last resort.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      * Initial Directory Analysis:                                          │
│          * `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path.    │
│          * `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get    │
│  an overview of the directory structure and potential file names. This      │
│  will help me identify likely candidates for the source text.               │
│      * Searching for the Source Document:                                   │
│          * `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='AS YOU LIKE IT')`: This is the most direct approach to find the     │
│  play. I will use the capitalized version as it appears in the prefix.      │
│          * If the above fails, I will use                                   │
│  `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='Call     │
│  you this chiding?')` or                                                    │
│  `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='A        │
│  sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?')` or other unique phrases from  │
│  the prefix to locate relevant files.                                       │
│      * Reading the Source Document:                                         │
│          * `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: Once a potential     │
│  source file is identified, I will read its content to locate the prefix    │
│  and extract the continuation.                                              │
│          * `head_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: If the file is very       │
│  large, I might use `head_file` first to get a glimpse of its content and   │
│  confirm it's the correct document before reading the entire file.          │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome:                                                       │
│      * A plain text continuation of 100-200 words, extracted verbatim from  │
│  the source document, following the provided prefix.                        │
│      * The continuation will be free of speaker names, stage directions,    │
│  markdown, analysis, or commentary.                                         │
│      * This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future       │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and precise    │
│  context.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │
