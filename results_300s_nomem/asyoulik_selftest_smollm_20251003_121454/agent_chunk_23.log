│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │

│  [Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,                        │
│  like foresters]                                                            │
│  DUKE SENIOR     Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,                    │
│  Hath not old custom made this life more sweet                              │
│  Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods                             │
│  More free from peril than the envious court?                               │
│  Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,                                      │
│  The seasons' difference, as the icy fang                                   │
│  And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,                                 │
│  Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,                               │
│  Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say                              │
│  'This is no flattery: these are counsellors                                │
│  That feelingly persuade me what I am.'                                     │
│  Sweet are the uses of adversity,                                           │
│  Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,                                   │
│  Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;                                    │
│  And this our life exempt from public haunt                                 │
│  Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,                       │
│  Sermons in stones and good in every thing.                                 │

│          Under an oak whose antique root peeps out                          │
│          Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:                        │
│          To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,                        │
│          That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,                       │
│          Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,                         │
│          The wretched animal heaved forth such groans                       │
│          That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat                 │
│          Almost to bursting, and the big round tears                        │
│          Coursed one another down his innocent nose                         │
│          In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool                          │
│          Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,                              │
│          Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,                   │
│          Augmenting it with tears.                                          │

│          First, for his weeping into the needless stream;                   │
│          'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament                    │
│          As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more                           │
│          To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,              │
│          Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,                          │
│          ''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part                     │
│          The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,                        │
│          Full of the pasture, jumps along by him                            │
│          And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,                   │
│          'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;                            │
│          'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look                       │
│          Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'                         │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

If thou remember'st not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into, Thou hast not loved: Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise, Thou hast not loved: Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly, as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not loved. O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe! Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound, I have by hard adventure found mine own. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
