│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │

│  you, fair youth; My gentle Phebe bid me give you this: I know not the      │
│  contents; but, as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she   │
│  did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor: pardon me: I    │
│  am but as a guiltless messenger. Patience herself would startle at this    │
│  letter And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all: She says I am not      │
│  fair, that I lack manners; She calls me proud, and that she could not      │
│  love me, Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will! Her love is not the   │
│  hare that I do hunt: Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well, This   │
│  is a letter of your own device. No, I protest, I know not the contents:    │
│  Phebe did write it. Come, come, you are a fool And turn'd into the         │
│  extremity of love. I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand. A              │
│  freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think That her old gloves were on,   │
│  but 'twas her hands: She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter: I     │
│  say she never did invent this letter; This is a man's invention            │

│  thy godhead laid apart, Warr'st thou with a woman's heart? Did you ever    │
│  hear such railing? Whiles the eye of man did woo me, That could do no      │
│  vengeance to me. Meaning me a beast. If the scorn of your bright eyne      │
│  Have power to raise such love in mine, Alack, in me what strange effect    │
│  Would they work in mild aspect! Whiles you chid me, I did love; How then   │
│  might your prayers move! He that brings this love to thee Little knows     │
│  this love in me: And by him seal up thy mind; Whether that thy youth and   │
│  kind Will the faithful offer take Of me and all that I can make; Or else   │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │
