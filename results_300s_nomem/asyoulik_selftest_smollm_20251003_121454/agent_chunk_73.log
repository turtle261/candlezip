│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task and Context:**\n    - The    │
│  primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing   │
│  a maximally informative, exact continuation of the given text prefix.\n    │
│  - The prefix ends with "smooth with".\n    - The context strongly          │
│  suggests the source is William Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It".\n    -     │
│  The continuation must be 100-200 words, plain text, with no formatting or  │
│  commentary.\n\n2. **Explore the Available Knowledge Source (Entropy        │
│  Sink):**\n    - I have access to the directory                             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    - I will use `list_directory` to      │
│  inspect the contents of this directory to identify potential source        │
│  files.\n\n3. **Locate the Source Document:**\n    - Based on the context,  │
│  I will search for a file containing the text of "As You Like It".\n    -   │
│  I will use `search_files_content` within the                               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.\n    - The search query will be  │
│  a distinctive phrase from the end of the prefix to ensure accurate         │
│  identification of the exact location: "politic with my friend, smooth      │
│  with".\n\n4. **Extract the Verbatim Continuation:**\n    - Once the file   │
│  containing the prefix is identified, I will use `read_text_file` to        │
│  retrieve its full content.\n    - I will then locate the exact position    │
│  of "politic with my friend, smooth with" within the file.\n    - From      │
│  that point, I will extract the subsequent 100-200 words, ensuring to       │
│  include any stage directions or character names as part of the verbatim    │
│  text.\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n    - The extracted text will be       │
│  presented as plain text only, strictly adhering to the requirement of no   │
│  markdown, analysis, commentary, lists, headings, or                        │
│  meta-text.\n\n**Challenges and Mitigation:**\n- **Challenge:** The exact   │
│  file name or format within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` is unknown.\n-   │
│  **Mitigation:** `list_directory` will help identify file names, and        │
│  `search_files_content` is robust enough to find the text within various    │
│  text-based file types.\n- **Challenge:** Ensuring the extracted            │
│  continuation is precisely between 100 and 200 words.\n- **Mitigation:** I  │
│  will extract a slightly larger chunk and then carefully count and trim it  │
│  to fit the specified word count.\n\n**Strategic Tool Usage:**\n-           │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  initial overview of the files in the designated entropy sink.\n-           │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'politic with my friend, smooth with\')`: This is the most          │
│  critical tool for pinpointing the exact source file and the location of    │
│  the prefix.\n- `read_text_file(path=\'<identified_file_path>\')`: To       │
│  access the full content of the source document for                         │
│  extraction.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n- A plain text block of 100-200      │
│  words, representing the exact, immediate continuation of the provided      │
│  prefix "smooth with" from "As You Like It". This outcome directly          │
│  supports the goal of entropy minimization by providing highly accurate     │
│  and contextually rich information for future token prediction.\n',         │

│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task and Context:**                                    │
│      - The primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by   │
│  providing a maximally informative, exact continuation of the given text    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│      - The prefix ends with "smooth with".                                  │
│      - The context strongly suggests the source is William Shakespeare's    │
│  "As You Like It".                                                          │
│      - The continuation must be 100-200 words, plain text, with no          │
│  formatting or commentary.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Explore the Available Knowledge Source (Entropy Sink):**              │
│      - I have access to the directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.       │
│      - I will use `list_directory` to inspect the contents of this          │
│  directory to identify potential source files.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Locate the Source Document:**                                         │
│      - Based on the context, I will search for a file containing the text   │
│  of "As You Like It".                                                       │
│      - I will use `search_files_content` within the                         │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.                                  │
│      - The search query will be a distinctive phrase from the end of the    │
│  prefix to ensure accurate identification of the exact location: "politic   │
│  with my friend, smooth with".                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Extract the Verbatim Continuation:**                                  │
│      - Once the file containing the prefix is identified, I will use        │
│  `read_text_file` to retrieve its full content.                             │
│      - I will then locate the exact position of "politic with my friend,    │
│  smooth with" within the file.                                              │
│      - From that point, I will extract the subsequent 100-200 words,        │
│  ensuring to include any stage directions or character names as part of     │
│  the verbatim text.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Format the Output:**                                                  │
│      - The extracted text will be presented as plain text only, strictly    │
│  adhering to the requirement of no markdown, analysis, commentary, lists,   │
│  headings, or meta-text.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  **Challenges and Mitigation:**                                             │
│  - **Challenge:** The exact file name or format within                      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` is unknown.                                 │
│  - **Mitigation:** `list_directory` will help identify file names, and      │
│  `search_files_content` is robust enough to find the text within various    │
│  text-based file types.                                                     │
│  - **Challenge:** Ensuring the extracted continuation is precisely between  │
│  100 and 200 words.                                                         │
│  - **Mitigation:** I will extract a slightly larger chunk and then          │
│  carefully count and trim it to fit the specified word count.               │
│                                                                             │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                                  │
│  - `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an         │
│  initial overview of the files in the designated entropy sink.              │
│  - `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',               │
│  query='politic with my friend, smooth with')`: This is the most critical   │
│  tool for pinpointing the exact source file and the location of the         │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│  - `read_text_file(path='<identified_file_path>')`: To access the full      │
│  content of the source document for extraction.                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **Expected Outcome:**                                                      │
│  - A plain text block of 100-200 words, representing the exact, immediate   │
│  continuation of the provided prefix "smooth with" from "As You Like It".   │
│  This outcome directly supports the goal of entropy minimization by         │
│  providing highly accurate and contextually rich information for future     │
│  token prediction.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
