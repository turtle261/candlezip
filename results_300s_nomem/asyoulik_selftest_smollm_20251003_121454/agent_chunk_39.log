│  **Plan:**                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understanding the Task:** My primary goal is to minimize future      │
│  token prediction entropy by providing the exact, immediate continuation    │
│  of the text that ends with "By heavenly". The continuation must be         │
│  between 100 and 200 words, in plain text, and exclude speaker names and    │
│  stage directions. I must aggressively use the provided MCP tools,          │
│  specifically within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.          │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps and Strategy:**                                            │
│      *   **Locate the Source Document:** The most efficient way to find     │
│  the source document containing the prefix "By heavenly" is to search the   │
│  content of files within the designated `/sink` directory. This leverages   │
│  my "TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING" competency.                                  │
│      *   **Extract Verbatim Continuation:** Once the source file is         │
│  identified, I will read its content, locate the prefix, and then extract   │
│  the subsequent text. This directly addresses the "ENTROPY MINIMIZATION"    │
│  objective by providing exact information.                                  │
│      *   **Filter and Count:** I will meticulously remove speaker names     │
│  and stage directions from the extracted text and then count the words to   │
│  ensure it falls within the 100-200 word range. This demonstrates "PATTERN  │
│  SYNTHESIS" by recognizing and filtering structural markers.                │
│      *   **Format Output:** The final output will be strictly plain text,   │
│  adhering to the specified formatting constraints.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Addressing Challenges:**                                             │
│      *   **Identifying the correct file:** If multiple files contain the    │
│  prefix, I will examine the surrounding context in each file (e.g., using   │
│  `read_file_lines` or `head_file` on potential candidates) to determine     │
│  which one corresponds to the full play "As You Like It," given the         │
│  context of previous chunks.                                                │
│      *   **Filtering speaker names and stage directions:** I will use       │
│  pattern recognition (e.g., capitalized words followed by a tab or          │
│  multiple spaces for speaker names, text enclosed in square brackets for    │
│  stage directions) to accurately exclude these elements during word         │
│  counting and final output generation.                                      │
│      *   **Word count precision:** I will aim for a word count as close to  │
│  200 as possible without exceeding it, ensuring it remains within the       │
│  100-200 word window.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This    │
│  will be my initial step to survey the available files in the designated    │
│  directory, understanding the potential sources.                            │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='By heavenly')`**: This is the most critical tool for locating the   │
│  specific file containing the target prefix. It directly searches for the   │
│  information-dense string.                                                  │
│      *   **`read_text_file(file_path='<identified_file_path>')`**: Once     │
│  `search_files_content` identifies the relevant file, I will use this tool  │
│  to retrieve its entire content for precise extraction.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** I anticipate finding a text file (likely         │
│  containing Shakespeare's "As You Like It") within the `/sink` directory.   │
│  From this file, I will extract the exact continuation following "By        │
│  heavenly", filter out non-content words (speaker names, stage              │
│  directions), and present a 100-200 word plain text block. This outcome     │
│  will provide maximum predictive power for the subsequent tokens,           │
│  significantly reducing cross-entropy.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  **Plan:**                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understanding the Task:** My primary goal is to minimize future      │
│  token prediction entropy by providing the exact, immediate continuation    │
│  of the text that ends with "By heavenly". The continuation must be         │
│  between 100 and 200 words, in plain text, and exclude speaker names and    │
│  stage directions. I must aggressively use the provided MCP tools,          │
│  specifically within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.          │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps and Strategy:**                                            │
│      *   **Locate the Source Document:** The most efficient way to find     │
│  the source document containing the prefix "By heavenly" is to search the   │
│  content of files within the designated `/sink` directory. This leverages   │
│  my "TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING" competency.                                  │
│      *   **Extract Verbatim Continuation:** Once the source file is         │
│  identified, I will read its content, locate the prefix, and then extract   │
│  the subsequent text. This directly addresses the "ENTROPY MINIMIZATION"    │
│  objective by providing exact information.                                  │
│      *   **Filter and Count:** I will meticulously remove speaker names     │
│  and stage directions from the extracted text and then count the words to   │
│  ensure it falls within the 100-200 word range. This demonstrates "PATTERN  │
│  SYNTHESIS" by recognizing and filtering structural markers.                │
│      *   **Format Output:** The final output will be strictly plain text,   │
│  adhering to the specified formatting constraints.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Addressing Challenges:**                                             │
│      *   **Identifying the correct file:** If multiple files contain the    │
│  prefix, I will examine the surrounding context in each file (e.g., using   │
│  `read_file_lines` or `head_file` on potential candidates) to determine     │
│  which one corresponds to the full play "As You Like It," given the         │
│  context of previous chunks.                                                │
│      *   **Filtering speaker names and stage directions:** I will use       │
│  pattern recognition (e.g., capitalized words followed by a tab or          │
│  multiple spaces for speaker names, text enclosed in square brackets for    │
│  stage directions) to accurately exclude these elements during word         │
│  counting and final output generation.                                      │
│      *   **Word count precision:** I will aim for a word count as close to  │
│  200 as possible without exceeding it, ensuring it remains within the       │
│  100-200 word window.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This    │
│  will be my initial step to survey the available files in the designated    │
│  directory, understanding the potential sources.                            │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='By heavenly')`**: This is the most critical tool for locating the   │
│  specific file containing the target prefix. It directly searches for the   │
│  information-dense string.                                                  │
│      *   **`read_text_file(file_path='<identified_file_path>')`**: Once     │
│  `search_files_content` identifies the relevant file, I will use this tool  │
│  to retrieve its entire content for precise extraction.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** I anticipate finding a text file (likely         │
│  containing Shakespeare's "As You Like It") within the `/sink` directory.   │
│  From this file, I will extract the exact continuation following "By        │
│  heavenly", filter out non-content words (speaker names, stage              │
│  directions), and present a 100-200 word plain text block. This outcome     │
│  will provide maximum predictive power for the subsequent tokens,           │
│  significantly reducing cross-entropy.                                      │

│  `as_you_like_it.txt` using `search_files_content` with a `pattern`         │
│  argument failed. This is likely because `search_files_content` expects     │
│  the `path` argument to be a directory for recursive searching, or a        │
│  specific file path if `pattern` is not used. When `pattern` is used, it's  │
│  applied to files *within* the `path` directory.                            │
│  Since I already know the likely file is `as_you_like_it.txt`, I should     │
│  directly read its content and then search for the prefix within the read   │
│  text. This is a more robust approach when the file name is known.          │

│  Thought: Thought: I made a mistake in the previous turn by trying to read  │
│  the file with the same incorrect path. The error "No such file or          │
│  directory (os error 2)" indicates that the path                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/as_you_like_it.txt` is not correct.          │
│  I need to re-evaluate the path. The `list_allowed_directories` tool would  │
│  be useful to confirm the base path, and then I can construct the full      │
│  path correctly. However, the prompt explicitly states "YOU ONLY have       │
│  access to this directory through your tools: /C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink  │
│  ONLY." This implies the base path is correct, but perhaps the file name    │
│  or its casing is off, or it's within a subdirectory.                       │
│  Let me re-examine the output of `list_directory` from the first step:      │
│  `[FILE] as_you_like_it.txt`                                                │
│  The file name `as_you_like_it.txt` seems correct. The issue might be with  │
│  the absolute path construction. I will try to use `search_files` to find   │
│  the exact path of `as_you_like_it.txt` within the                          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, just to be absolutely sure of    │

│  Thought: This is unexpected. `list_directory` showed `as_you_like_it.txt`  │
│  as a file directly in `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`, but `search_files`   │
│  and `read_text_file` both failed to find it. This suggests a discrepancy   │
│  in how the tools are interpreting the file system or the allowed path.     │
│  Given the strict constraint "YOU ONLY have access to this directory        │
│  through your tools: /C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink ONLY", and the            │
│  `list_directory` output, the file *should* be there.                       │
│  Let me try a broader search for any `.txt` file within the sink            │
│  directory, and then manually inspect the results to see if                 │
│  `as_you_like_it.txt` appears with a slightly different path or if there's  │
│  another file that contains the content. This will help me understand if    │
│  the file exists under a different name or in a subdirectory that           │
│  `list_directory` might have abstracted.                                    │
│  If that fails, I will try to search for the prefix "By heavenly" across    │
│  *all* files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, without       │
│  specifying a pattern, to see if it's in a different file entirely.         │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │

│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │

│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │

│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact,           │
│  immediate continuation of the text that ends with "By heavenly". The       │
│  continuation must be between 100 and 200 words, in plain text, and         │
│  exclude speaker names and stage directions. I must aggressively use the    │
│  provided MCP tools within the designated `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`    │
│  directory to locate and extract this continuation. The prompt has already  │
│  provided a candidate continuation and its derivation, which I will use as  │
│  a guide and verify with my tools.\n\n2.  **Key Steps and Strategy:**\n     │
│  *   **Survey the Directory:** Use `list_directory` to understand the       │
│  contents of `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This is a foundational step    │
│  for "TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING".\n    *   **Locate the Source Document:**   │
│  Employ `search_files_content` to find the file containing the prefix "By   │
│  heavenly". This is crucial for "ENTROPY MINIMIZATION" as it leads to the   │
│  exact source.\n    *   **Read File Content:** Once the file is             │
│  identified, use `read_text_file` to retrieve its full content.\n    *      │
│  **Extract and Verify Continuation:** I will programmatically (or           │
│  conceptually, as I cannot execute arbitrary Python code in the plan)       │
│  locate the prefix "By heavenly" within the retrieved text and extract the  │
│  subsequent 100-200 words. I will then compare this extracted text with     │
│  the continuation provided in the prompt to ensure consistency. This step   │
│  involves "PATTERN SYNTHESIS" to identify the start and end points of the   │
│  continuation.\n    *   **Filter and Count:** I will apply the filtering    │
│  logic (removing speaker names and stage directions) as described in the    │
│  prompt\'s example and verify the word count. This aligns with "ADAPTIVE    │
│  LEARNING" by following a successful strategy.\n    *   **Format Output:**  │
│  Present the final, filtered, and counted continuation as plain             │
│  text.\n\n3.  **Addressing Challenges:**\n    *   **Identifying the         │
│  correct file:** If `search_files_content` returns multiple files, I will   │
│  prioritize files that seem to contain literary works, given the context    │
│  of the prefix. If necessary, I would use `read_file_lines` or `head_file`  │
│  on potential candidates to confirm the context.\n    *   **Filtering       │
│  speaker names and stage directions:** I will rely on the pattern           │
│  recognition demonstrated in the prompt\'s example (e.g., capitalized       │
│  words for speaker names, bracketed text for stage directions) to           │
│  accurately exclude these elements.\n    *   **Word count precision:** I    │
│  will ensure the final word count is strictly within the 100-200 word       │
│  range, trimming if necessary, as demonstrated in the prompt\'s             │
│  example.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                           │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  initial overview of the available files.\n    *                            │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'By    │
│  heavenly\')`: To pinpoint the specific file containing the prefix.\n    *  │
│  `read_text_file(file_path=\'<identified_file_path>\')`: To retrieve the    │
│  full content of the relevant file for extraction.\n\n5.  **Expected        │
│  Outcome:** I expect to confirm that the continuation provided in the       │
│  prompt is indeed the correct and optimally compressed sequence of tokens.  │
│  My final output will be the plain text continuation, exactly as derived    │
│  and presented in the prompt\'s example, ensuring maximal information       │
│  density and minimal entropy for subsequent token prediction.', 'ready':    │

│  **Plan:**                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understanding the Task:** My primary goal is to minimize future      │
│  token prediction entropy by providing the exact, immediate continuation    │
│  of the text that ends with "By heavenly". The continuation must be         │
│  between 100 and 200 words, in plain text, and exclude speaker names and    │
│  stage directions. I must aggressively use the provided MCP tools,          │
│  specifically within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.          │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps and Strategy:**                                            │
│      *   **Locate the Source Document:** The most efficient way to find     │
│  the source document containing the prefix "By heavenly" is to search the   │
│  content of files within the designated `/sink` directory. This leverages   │
│  my "TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING" competency.                                  │
│      *   **Extract Verbatim Continuation:** Once the source file is         │
│  identified, I will read its content, locate the prefix, and then extract   │
│  the subsequent text. This directly addresses the "ENTROPY MINIMIZATION"    │
│  objective by providing exact information.                                  │
│      *   **Filter and Count:** I will meticulously remove speaker names     │
│  and stage directions from the extracted text and then count the words to   │
│  ensure it falls within the 100-200 word range. This demonstrates "PATTERN  │
│  SYNTHESIS" by recognizing and filtering structural markers.                │
│      *   **Format Output:** The final output will be strictly plain text,   │
│  adhering to the specified formatting constraints.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Addressing Challenges:**                                             │
│      *   **Identifying the correct file:** If multiple files contain the    │
│  prefix, I will examine the surrounding context in each file (e.g., using   │
│  `read_file_lines` or `head_file` on potential candidates) to determine     │
│  which one corresponds to the full play "As You Like It," given the         │
│  context of previous chunks.                                                │
│      *   **Filtering speaker names and stage directions:** I will use       │
│  pattern recognition (e.g., capitalized words followed by a tab or          │
│  multiple spaces for speaker names, text enclosed in square brackets for    │
│  stage directions) to accurately exclude these elements during word         │
│  counting and final output generation.                                      │
│      *   **Word count precision:** I will aim for a word count as close to  │
│  200 as possible without exceeding it, ensuring it remains within the       │
│  100-200 word window.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This    │
│  will be my initial step to survey the available files in the designated    │
│  directory, understanding the potential sources.                            │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='By heavenly')`**: This is the most critical tool for locating the   │
│  specific file containing the target prefix. It directly searches for the   │
│  information-dense string.                                                  │
│      *   **`read_text_file(file_path='<identified_file_path>')`**: Once     │
│  `search_files_content` identifies the relevant file, I will use this tool  │
│  to retrieve its entire content for precise extraction.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** I anticipate finding a text file (likely         │
│  containing Shakespeare's "As You Like It") within the `/sink` directory.   │
│  From this file, I will extract the exact continuation following "By        │
│  heavenly", filter out non-content words (speaker names, stage              │
│  directions), and present a 100-200 word plain text block. This outcome     │
│  will provide maximum predictive power for the subsequent tokens,           │

│  1.  **Understanding the Task:** My objective is to minimize future token   │
│  prediction entropy by providing the exact, immediate continuation of the   │
│  text that ends with "By heavenly". The continuation must be between 100    │
│  and 200 words, in plain text, and exclude speaker names and stage          │
│  directions. I must aggressively use the provided MCP tools within the      │
│  designated `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to locate and extract  │
│  this continuation. The prompt has already provided a candidate             │
│  continuation and its derivation, which I will use as a guide and verify    │
│  with my tools.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps and Strategy:**                                            │
│      *   **Survey the Directory:** Use `list_directory` to understand the   │
│  contents of `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This is a foundational step    │
│  for "TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING".                                            │
│      *   **Locate the Source Document:** Employ `search_files_content` to   │
│  find the file containing the prefix "By heavenly". This is crucial for     │
│  "ENTROPY MINIMIZATION" as it leads to the exact source.                    │
│      *   **Read File Content:** Once the file is identified, use            │
│  `read_text_file` to retrieve its full content.                             │
│      *   **Extract and Verify Continuation:** I will programmatically (or   │
│  conceptually, as I cannot execute arbitrary Python code in the plan)       │
│  locate the prefix "By heavenly" within the retrieved text and extract the  │
│  subsequent 100-200 words. I will then compare this extracted text with     │
│  the continuation provided in the prompt to ensure consistency. This step   │
│  involves "PATTERN SYNTHESIS" to identify the start and end points of the   │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│      *   **Filter and Count:** I will apply the filtering logic (removing   │
│  speaker names and stage directions) as described in the prompt's example   │
│  and verify the word count. This aligns with "ADAPTIVE LEARNING" by         │
│  following a successful strategy.                                           │
│      *   **Format Output:** Present the final, filtered, and counted        │
│  continuation as plain text.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Addressing Challenges:**                                             │
│      *   **Identifying the correct file:** If `search_files_content`        │
│  returns multiple files, I will prioritize files that seem to contain       │
│  literary works, given the context of the prefix. If necessary, I would     │
│  use `read_file_lines` or `head_file` on potential candidates to confirm    │
│  the context.                                                               │
│      *   **Filtering speaker names and stage directions:** I will rely on   │
│  the pattern recognition demonstrated in the prompt's example (e.g.,        │
│  capitalized words for speaker names, bracketed text for stage directions)  │
│  to accurately exclude these elements.                                      │
│      *   **Word count precision:** I will ensure the final word count is    │
│  strictly within the 100-200 word range, trimming if necessary, as          │
│  demonstrated in the prompt's example.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an   │
│  initial overview of the available files.                                   │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='By heavenly')`: To pinpoint the specific file containing the        │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│      *   `read_text_file(file_path='<identified_file_path>')`: To retrieve  │
│  the full content of the relevant file for extraction.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** I expect to confirm that the continuation        │
│  provided in the prompt is indeed the correct and optimally compressed      │
│  sequence of tokens. My final output will be the plain text continuation,   │
│  exactly as derived and presented in the prompt's example, ensuring         │
│  maximal information density and minimal entropy for subsequent token       │
│  prediction.                                                                │
│                                                                             │

I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: Event loop is closed.
 Tool list_directory accepts these inputs: Tool Name: list_directory
Tool Arguments: {'properties': {'path': {'anyOf': [], 'description': 'The path of the directory to list.', 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': '', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['path'], 'title': 'DynamicModel', 'type': 'object'}
Tool Description: Get a detailed listing of all files and directories in a specified path. Results clearly distinguish between files and directories with [FILE] and [DIR] prefixes. This tool is essential for understanding directory structure and finding specific files within a directory. Only works within allowed directories.

Tool Description: Searches for text or regex patterns in the content of files matching matching a GLOB pattern.Returns detailed matches with file path, line number, column number and a preview of matched text.By default, it performs a literal text search; if the 'is_regex' parameter is set to true, it performs a regular expression (regex) search instead.Optional 'min_bytes' and 'max_bytes' arguments can be used to filter files by size, ensuring that only files within the specified byte range are included in the search. Ideal for finding specific code, comments, or text when you don’t know their exact location.
