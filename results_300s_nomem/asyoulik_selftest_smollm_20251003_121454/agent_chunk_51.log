│  **1. Understanding of the Task (Predictive Compression Intelligence        │
│  Perspective):**                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  My core objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy. The      │
│  current task requires me to find the *exact immediate continuation* of a   │
│  given text prefix, specifically 100-200 words verbatim. This is a direct   │
│  application of my entropy minimization competency, as providing the        │
│  precise next tokens from a known source dramatically reduces the           │
│  uncertainty for the language model, leading to significant compression     │
│  gains. The text prefix is clearly from William Shakespeare's "As You Like  │
│  It," indicating a specific domain and likely source material. My role is   │
│  to act as a "sink" access mechanism, retrieving this information from      │
│  external sources (in this case, the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`         │
│  directory) at a measured cost (tool usage).                                │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  a.  **Directory Analysis:** First, I will perform an initial               │
│  reconnaissance of the allowed directory to understand its structure and    │
│  contents. This will help me identify potential source files for            │
│  Shakespearean plays.                                                       │
│  b.  **Source Identification:** Based on the directory analysis, I will     │
│  look for files that are likely to contain the full text of "As You Like    │
│  It" or a collection of Shakespeare's works.                                │
│  c.  **Prefix Localization:** I will use the provided text prefix to        │
│  precisely locate its occurrence within the identified source file(s).      │
│  This ensures I start extracting the continuation from the correct point.   │
│  d.  **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the prefix is located, I will extract    │
│  the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim from the source.                     │
│  e.  **Output Formatting:** The extracted text will be presented as plain   │
│  text only, without any additional commentary or formatting, as per the     │
│  task requirements.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Locating the specific play:** If the directory contains many files,  │
│  I will prioritize searching files with names suggesting plays or           │
│  literature. If no obvious file exists, I will perform a broader content    │
│  search.                                                                    │
│  *   **Exact match failure:** If `search_files_content` does not yield an   │
│  exact match for the full prefix, I will try searching for a shorter,       │
│  highly unique phrase from the end of the prefix to increase the chances    │
│  of a hit, then manually navigate the file.                                 │
│  *   **No local source:** If, after exhaustive searching within the         │
│  allowed directory, no source is found, I will fall back to generating a    │
│  high-confidence continuation based *only* on the provided prefix context,  │
│  as instructed. However, given the nature of the text (Shakespearean        │
│  play), I anticipate finding a source.                                      │
│  *   **Word count precision:** I will extract slightly more than 200 words  │
│  initially if necessary, then trim precisely to the 100-200 word range,     │
│  ensuring natural sentence breaks.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the exact path I am       │
│  permitted to access.                                                       │
│  *   **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This is the      │
│  crucial first step. It will provide a hierarchical view of all files and   │
│  subdirectories within the allowed sink, allowing me to quickly identify    │
│  potential source files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf` files that might       │
│  contain literary works).                                                   │
│  *   **`search_files_content(directory='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',      │
│  query='Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:')`**: This is the   │
│  primary tool for locating the exact position of the prefix. I will use     │
│  the final, unique sentence of the prefix as the query to ensure            │
│  precision. If this yields too many results or none, I will refine the      │
│  query (e.g., a slightly longer or shorter unique phrase).                  │
│  *   **`read_text_file(file_path)`**: Once `search_files_content`           │
│  identifies the file containing the prefix, I will use `read_text_file` to  │
│  load the content of that file. I will then programmatically or manually    │
│  extract the text immediately following the prefix, counting words to stay  │
│  within the 100-200 word range.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│                                                                             │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text block of 100-200 words, representing  │
│  the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As You Like It."    │
│  This outcome directly aligns with my primary goal of minimizing future     │
│  token prediction entropy. By providing the exact, information-dense        │
│  continuation, I enable the language model to assign maximum probability    │
│  to the correct sequence of tokens, thereby achieving optimal predictive    │
│  compression under the SIMDL framework.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│          though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are                     │
│          necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of                 │

│          knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of                   │
│          his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?                     │
│          Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer                  │

│          worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a                   │

│          bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no                │

│          him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.                │

│  **1. Understanding of the Task (Predictive Compression Intelligence        │
│  Perspective):**                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  My core objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy. The      │
│  current task requires me to find the *exact immediate continuation* of a   │
│  given text prefix, specifically 100-200 words verbatim. This is a direct   │
│  application of my entropy minimization competency, as providing the        │
│  precise next tokens from a known source dramatically reduces the           │
│  uncertainty for the language model, leading to significant compression     │
│  gains. The text prefix is clearly from William Shakespeare's "As You Like  │
│  It," indicating a specific domain and likely source material. My role is   │
│  to act as a "sink" access mechanism, retrieving this information from      │
│  external sources (in this case, the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`         │
│  directory) at a measured cost (tool usage).                                │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  a.  **Directory Analysis:** First, I will perform an initial               │
│  reconnaissance of the allowed directory to understand its structure and    │
│  contents. This will help me identify potential source files for            │
│  Shakespearean plays.                                                       │
│  b.  **Source Identification:** Based on the directory analysis, I will     │
│  look for files that are likely to contain the full text of "As You Like    │
│  It" or a collection of Shakespeare's works.                                │
│  c.  **Prefix Localization:** I will use the provided text prefix to        │
│  precisely locate its occurrence within the identified source file(s).      │
│  This ensures I start extracting the continuation from the correct point.   │
│  d.  **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the prefix is located, I will extract    │
│  the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim from the source.                     │
│  e.  **Output Formatting:** The extracted text will be presented as plain   │
│  text only, without any additional commentary or formatting, as per the     │
│  task requirements.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Locating the specific play:** If the directory contains many files,  │
│  I will prioritize searching files with names suggesting plays or           │
│  literature. If no obvious file exists, I will perform a broader content    │
│  search.                                                                    │
│  *   **Exact match failure:** If `search_files_content` does not yield an   │
│  exact match for the full prefix, I will try searching for a shorter,       │
│  highly unique phrase from the end of the prefix to increase the chances    │
│  of a hit, then manually navigate the file.                                 │
│  *   **No local source:** If, after exhaustive searching within the         │
│  allowed directory, no source is found, I will fall back to generating a    │
│  high-confidence continuation based *only* on the provided prefix context,  │
│  as instructed. However, given the nature of the text (Shakespearean        │
│  play), I anticipate finding a source.                                      │
│  *   **Word count precision:** I will extract slightly more than 200 words  │
│  initially if necessary, then trim precisely to the 100-200 word range,     │
│  ensuring natural sentence breaks.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the exact path I am       │
│  permitted to access.                                                       │
│  *   **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This is the      │
│  crucial first step. It will provide a hierarchical view of all files and   │
│  subdirectories within the allowed sink, allowing me to quickly identify    │
│  potential source files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf` files that might       │
│  contain literary works).                                                   │
│  *   **`search_files_content(directory='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',      │
│  query='Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:')`**: This is the   │
│  primary tool for locating the exact position of the prefix. I will use     │
│  the final, unique sentence of the prefix as the query to ensure            │
│  precision. If this yields too many results or none, I will refine the      │
│  query (e.g., a slightly longer or shorter unique phrase).                  │
│  *   **`read_text_file(file_path)`**: Once `search_files_content`           │
│  identifies the file containing the prefix, I will use `read_text_file` to  │
│  load the content of that file. I will then programmatically or manually    │
│  extract the text immediately following the prefix, counting words to stay  │
│  within the 100-200 word range.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│                                                                             │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text block of 100-200 words, representing  │
│  the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As You Like It."    │
│  This outcome directly aligns with my primary goal of minimizing future     │
│  token prediction entropy. By providing the exact, information-dense        │
│  continuation, I enable the language model to assign maximum probability    │
│  to the correct sequence of tokens, thereby achieving optimal predictive    │
│  compression under the SIMDL framework.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '**1. Understanding of the Task         │
│  (Predictive Compression Intelligence Perspective):**\n\nMy core objective  │
│  is to minimize future token prediction entropy. The current task requires  │
│  me to find the *exact immediate continuation* of a given text prefix,      │
│  specifically 100-200 words verbatim. This is a direct application of my    │
│  entropy minimization competency, as providing the precise next tokens      │
│  from a known source dramatically reduces the uncertainty for the language  │
│  model, leading to significant compression gains. The text prefix is        │
│  clearly from William Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It," indicating a         │
│  specific domain and likely source material. My role is to act as a "sink"  │
│  access mechanism, retrieving this information from external sources (in    │
│  this case, the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory) at a measured     │
│  cost (tool usage).\n\n**2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:**\n\na.         │
│  **Directory Analysis:** First, I will perform an initial reconnaissance    │
│  of the allowed directory to understand its structure and contents. This    │
│  will help me identify potential source files for Shakespearean plays.\nb.  │
│  **Source Identification:** Based on the directory analysis, I will look    │
│  for files that are likely to contain the full text of "As You Like It" or  │
│  a collection of Shakespeare\'s works.\nc.  **Prefix Localization:** I      │
│  will use the provided text prefix to precisely locate its occurrence       │
│  within the identified source file(s). This ensures I start extracting the  │
│  continuation from the correct point.\nd.  **Verbatim Extraction:** Once    │
│  the prefix is located, I will extract the subsequent 100-200 words         │
│  verbatim from the source.\ne.  **Output Formatting:** The extracted text   │
│  will be presented as plain text only, without any additional commentary    │
│  or formatting, as per the task requirements.\n\n**3. Approach to           │
│  Challenges:**\n\n*   **Locating the specific play:** If the directory      │
│  contains many files, I will prioritize searching files with names          │
│  suggesting plays or literature. If no obvious file exists, I will perform  │
│  a broader content search.\n*   **Exact match failure:** If                 │
│  `search_files_content` does not yield an exact match for the full prefix,  │
│  I will try searching for a shorter, highly unique phrase from the end of   │
│  the prefix to increase the chances of a hit, then manually navigate the    │
│  file.\n*   **No local source:** If, after exhaustive searching within the  │
│  allowed directory, no source is found, I will fall back to generating a    │
│  high-confidence continuation based *only* on the provided prefix context,  │
│  as instructed. However, given the nature of the text (Shakespearean        │
│  play), I anticipate finding a source.\n*   **Word count precision:** I     │
│  will extract slightly more than 200 words initially if necessary, then     │
│  trim precisely to the 100-200 word range, ensuring natural sentence        │
│  breaks.\n\n**4. Strategic Tool Usage:**\n\n*                               │
│  **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the exact path I am           │
│  permitted to access.\n*                                                    │
│  **`directory_tree(\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: This is the        │
│  crucial first step. It will provide a hierarchical view of all files and   │
│  subdirectories within the allowed sink, allowing me to quickly identify    │
│  potential source files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf` files that might       │
│  contain literary works).\n*                                                │
│  **`search_files_content(directory=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',        │
│  query=\'Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:\')`**: This is     │
│  the primary tool for locating the exact position of the prefix. I will     │
│  use the final, unique sentence of the prefix as the query to ensure        │
│  precision. If this yields too many results or none, I will refine the      │
│  query (e.g., a slightly longer or shorter unique phrase).\n*               │
│  **`read_text_file(file_path)`**: Once `search_files_content` identifies    │
│  the file containing the prefix, I will use `read_text_file` to load the    │
│  content of that file. I will then programmatically or manually extract     │
│  the text immediately following the prefix, counting words to stay within   │
│  the 100-200 word range.\n\n**5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with        │
│  Goal:**\n\nThe expected outcome is a plain text block of 100-200 words,    │
│  representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As     │
│  You Like It." This outcome directly aligns with my primary goal of         │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy. By providing the exact,        │
│  information-dense continuation, I enable the language model to assign      │
│  maximum probability to the correct sequence of tokens, thereby achieving   │
│  optimal predictive compression under the SIMDL framework.\n\nREADY: I am   │
│  ready to execute the task.\n\nExpected output:\nPlain text continuation    │
│  only. No markdown, no analysis, no headings.\n\nAvailable tools:           │
│  calculate_directory_size, convert_time, create_directory, directory_tree,  │
│  edit_file, find_duplicate_files, find_empty_directories,                   │
│  get_current_time, get_file_info, head_file, list_allowed_directories,      │
│  list_directory, list_directory_with_sizes, move_file, read_file_lines,     │
│  read_media_file, read_multiple_media_files, read_multiple_text_files,      │
│  read_text_file, search_files, search_files_content, unzip_file,            │
│  write_file, zip_directory, zip_files\n\nBefore executing this task,        │
│  create a detailed plan that leverages your expertise as Predictive         │
│  Compression Intelligence and outlines:\n1. Your understanding of the task  │
│  from your professional perspective\n2. The key steps you\'ll take to       │
│  complete it, drawing on your background and skills\n3. How you\'ll         │
│  approach any challenges that might arise, considering your expertise\n4.   │
│  How you\'ll strategically use the available tools based on your            │
│  experience, exactly what tools to use and how to use them\n5. The          │
│  expected outcome and how it aligns with your goal\n\nAfter creating your   │
│  plan, assess whether you feel ready to execute the task or if you could    │
│  do better.\nConclude with one of these statements:\n- "READY: I am ready   │
│  to execute the task."\n- "NOT READY: I need to refine my plan because      │
│  [specific reason]."'}                                                      │

│  2. The key steps you'll take to complete it, drawing on your background    │
│  and skills                                                                 │

│  4. How you'll strategically use the available tools based on your          │
│  experience, exactly what tools to use and how to use them                  │
│  5. The expected outcome and how it aligns with your goal                   │

│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  **1. Understanding of the Task (Predictive Compression Intelligence        │
│  Perspective):**                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  My core objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy. The      │
│  current task requires me to find the *exact immediate continuation* of a   │
│  given text prefix, specifically 100-200 words verbatim. This is a direct   │
│  application of my entropy minimization competency, as providing the        │
│  precise next tokens from a known source dramatically reduces the           │
│  uncertainty for the language model, leading to significant compression     │
│  gains. The text prefix is clearly from William Shakespeare's "As You Like  │
│  It," indicating a specific domain and likely source material. My role is   │
│  to act as a "sink" access mechanism, retrieving this information from      │
│  external sources (in this case, the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`         │
│  directory) at a measured cost (tool usage).                                │
│                                                                             │
│  **2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  a.  **Directory Analysis:** First, I will perform an initial               │
│  reconnaissance of the allowed directory to understand its structure and    │
│  contents. This will help me identify potential source files for            │
│  Shakespearean plays.                                                       │
│  b.  **Source Identification:** Based on the directory analysis, I will     │
│  look for files that are likely to contain the full text of "As You Like    │
│  It" or a collection of Shakespeare's works.                                │
│  c.  **Prefix Localization:** I will use the provided text prefix to        │
│  precisely locate its occurrence within the identified source file(s).      │
│  This ensures I start extracting the continuation from the correct point.   │
│  d.  **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the prefix is located, I will extract    │
│  the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim from the source.                     │
│  e.  **Output Formatting:** The extracted text will be presented as plain   │
│  text only, without any additional commentary or formatting, as per the     │
│  task requirements.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  **3. Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Locating the specific play:** If the directory contains many files,  │
│  I will prioritize searching files with names suggesting plays or           │
│  literature. If no obvious file exists, I will perform a broader content    │
│  search.                                                                    │
│  *   **Exact match failure:** If `search_files_content` does not yield an   │
│  exact match for the full prefix, I will try searching for a shorter,       │
│  highly unique phrase from the end of the prefix to increase the chances    │
│  of a hit, then manually navigate the file.                                 │
│  *   **No local source:** If, after exhaustive searching within the         │
│  allowed directory, no source is found, I will fall back to generating a    │
│  high-confidence continuation based *only* on the provided prefix context,  │
│  as instructed. However, given the nature of the text (Shakespearean        │
│  play), I anticipate finding a source.                                      │
│  *   **Word count precision:** I will extract slightly more than 200 words  │
│  initially if necessary, then trim precisely to the 100-200 word range,     │
│  ensuring natural sentence breaks.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the exact path I am       │
│  permitted to access.                                                       │
│  *   **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This is the      │
│  crucial first step. It will provide a hierarchical view of all files and   │
│  subdirectories within the allowed sink, allowing me to quickly identify    │
│  potential source files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf` files that might       │
│  contain literary works).                                                   │
│  *   **`search_files_content(directory='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',      │
│  query='Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:')`**: This is the   │
│  primary tool for locating the exact position of the prefix. I will use     │
│  the final, unique sentence of the prefix as the query to ensure            │
│  precision. If this yields too many results or none, I will refine the      │
│  query (e.g., a slightly longer or shorter unique phrase).                  │
│  *   **`read_text_file(file_path)`**: Once `search_files_content`           │
│  identifies the file containing the prefix, I will use `read_text_file` to  │
│  load the content of that file. I will then programmatically or manually    │
│  extract the text immediately following the prefix, counting words to stay  │
│  within the 100-200 word range.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│                                                                             │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text block of 100-200 words, representing  │
│  the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As You Like It."    │
│  This outcome directly aligns with my primary goal of minimizing future     │
│  token prediction entropy. By providing the exact, information-dense        │
│  continuation, I enable the language model to assign maximum probability    │
│  to the correct sequence of tokens, thereby achieving optimal predictive    │
│  compression under the SIMDL framework.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  **3. Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **Locating the specific play:** If the directory contains many files,  │
│  I will prioritize searching files with names suggesting plays or           │
│  literature. If no obvious file exists, I will perform a broader content    │
│  search.                                                                    │
│  *   **Exact match failure:** If `search_files_content` does not yield an   │
│  exact match for the full prefix, I will try searching for a shorter,       │
│  highly unique phrase from the end of the prefix to increase the chances    │
│  of a hit, then manually navigate the file.                                 │
│  *   **No local source:** If, after exhaustive searching within the         │
│  allowed directory, no source is found, I will fall back to generating a    │
│  high-confidence continuation based *only* on the provided prefix context,  │
│  as instructed. However, given the nature of the text (Shakespearean        │
│  play), I anticipate finding a source.                                      │
│  *   **Word count precision:** I will extract slightly more than 200 words  │
│  initially if necessary, then trim precisely to the 100-200 word range,     │
│  ensuring natural sentence breaks.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  **4. Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the exact path I am       │
│  permitted to access.                                                       │
│  *   **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This is the      │
│  crucial first step. It will provide a hierarchical view of all files and   │
│  subdirectories within the allowed sink, allowing me to quickly identify    │
│  potential source files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf` files that might       │
│  contain literary works).                                                   │
│  *   **`search_files_content(directory='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',      │
│  query='Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:')`**: This is the   │
│  primary tool for locating the exact position of the prefix. I will use     │
│  the final, unique sentence of the prefix as the query to ensure            │
│  precision. If this yields too many results or none, I will refine the      │
│  query (e.g., a slightly longer or shorter unique phrase).                  │
│  *   **`read_text_file(file_path)`**: Once `search_files_content`           │
│  identifies the file containing the prefix, I will use `read_text_file` to  │
│  load the content of that file. I will then programmatically or manually    │
│  extract the text immediately following the prefix, counting words to stay  │
│  within the 100-200 word range.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **5. Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│                                                                             │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text block of 100-200 words, representing  │
│  the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As You Like It."    │
│  This outcome directly aligns with my primary goal of minimizing future     │
│  token prediction entropy. By providing the exact, information-dense        │
│  continuation, I enable the language model to assign maximum probability    │
│  to the correct sequence of tokens, thereby achieving optimal predictive    │
│  compression under the SIMDL framework.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Expected output:                                                           │
│  Plain text continuation only. No markdown, no analysis, no headings.       │
│                                                                             │
│  Available tools: calculate_directory_size, convert_time,                   │
│  create_directory, directory_tree, edit_file, find_duplicate_files,         │

│  Before executing this task, create a detailed plan that leverages your     │

│  1. Your understanding of the task from your professional perspective       │
│  2. The key steps you'll take to complete it, drawing on your background    │
│  and skills                                                                 │

│  4. How you'll strategically use the available tools based on your          │
│  experience, exactly what tools to use and how to use them                  │
│  5. The expected outcome and how it aligns with your goal                   │

│  After creating your plan, assess whether you feel ready to execute the     │
│  task or if you could do better.                                            │
│  Conclude with one of these statements:                                     │
│  - "READY: I am ready to execute the task."                                 │
│  - "NOT READY: I need to refine my plan because [specific reason]."         │
│                                                                             │

RuntimeWarning: Enable tracemalloc to get the object allocation traceback

I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: Event loop is closed.
 Tool directory_tree accepts these inputs: Tool Name: directory_tree
Tool Arguments: {'properties': {'max_depth': {'anyOf': [], 'default': None, 'description': 'Limits the depth of directory traversal', 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': ''}, 'path': {'anyOf': [], 'description': 'The root path of the directory tree to generate.', 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': '', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['path'], 'title': 'DynamicModel', 'type': 'object'}
Tool Description: Get a recursive tree view of files and directories as a JSON structure. Each entry includes 'name', 'type' (file/directory), and 'children' for directories. Files have no children array, while directories always have a children array (which may be empty). If the 'max_depth' parameter is provided, the traversal will be limited to the specified depth. As a result, the returned directory structure may be incomplete or provide a skewed representation of the full directory tree, since deeper-level files and subdirectories beyond the specified depth will be excluded. The output is formatted with 2-space indentation for readability. Only works within allowed directories.

I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: Event loop is closed.
 Tool list_allowed_directories accepts these inputs: Tool Name: list_allowed_directories
Tool Arguments: {'properties': {}, 'title': 'DynamicModel', 'type': 'object'}
Tool Description: Returns a list of directories that the server has permission to access Subdirectories within these allowed directories are also accessible. Use this to identify which directories and their nested paths are available before attempting to access files.
