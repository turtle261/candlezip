│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective): The task  │
│  is to find the exact continuation of a given text prefix. From a SIMDL     │
│  perspective, this means identifying the source document to achieve         │
│  maximum compression (zero entropy for the next tokens) by providing the    │
│  exact sequence. The cost of accessing external information (tools) is      │
│  justified if it leads to a significant reduction in prediction entropy.    │
│  The context strongly suggests a Shakespearean play, specifically "As You   │
│  Like It."\n\n2. Key Steps:\n    *   Step 1: Directory Analysis: List the   │
│  contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand     │
│  what potential source documents are available.\n    *   Step 2: Targeted   │
│  Search: Based on the prefix (Shakespeare, "As You Like It"), I will        │
│  search for files within the allowed directory that contain the prefix.\n   │
│  *   Step 3: Extract Continuation: Once the source file is identified, I    │
│  will read the file and extract the text immediately following the          │
│  prefix.\n    *   Step 4: Verify and Format: Ensure the extracted           │
│  continuation is between 100-200 words and is in plain text format.\n\n3.   │
│  Challenges and Approach:\n    *   Challenge 1: Finding the exact source:   │
│  The directory might contain many files, or the specific play might not be  │
│  immediately obvious.\n        *   Approach: Use `list_directory` first to  │
│  get an overview. Then, use `search_files_content` with a distinctive part  │
│  of the prefix to pinpoint the exact file. The prefix contains dialogue     │
│  with character names, which are good search terms.\n    *   Challenge 2:   │
│  Extracting the exact continuation: Once the file is found, I need to       │
│  accurately locate the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent         │
│  text.\n        *   Approach: Read the entire file content using            │
│  `read_text_file`. Then, use string manipulation (e.g., `find()` and        │
│  slicing) to get the text immediately after the prefix. I will need to be   │
│  careful with line breaks and formatting in the source text.\n    *         │
│  Challenge 3: Word count and formatting: Ensuring the output is 100-200     │
│  words and plain text.\n        *   Approach: After extracting the          │
│  continuation, I will split it into words and count them. If it\'s too      │
│  short, I\'ll take more; if too long, I\'ll trim it. I will ensure no       │
│  markdown or extra commentary is included.\n\n4. Strategic Tool Usage:\n\n  │
│  *   Tool 1: `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`\n      │
│  *   Purpose: To get an initial overview of the files present in the        │
│  allowed directory. This helps in understanding the potential scope of      │
│  available "entropy sinks."\n        *   Rationale: Before searching for    │
│  specific content, it\'s good to know what files are even present.\n\n      │
│  *   Tool 2: `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',   │
│  query=\'You tell us the manner of the wrestling.\')`\n        *            │
│  Purpose: To locate the specific file containing the exact prefix.\n        │
│  *   Rationale: The prefix is quite specific, especially the last line of   │
│  dialogue. Searching for this exact phrase will likely lead directly to     │
│  the source document. I will use a distinctive part of the prefix to        │
│  minimize false positives.\n\n    *   Tool 3:                               │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'[identified_file_path]\')`\n        *   Purpose:    │
│  To read the entire content of the identified source file.\n        *       │
│  Rationale: Once the file is found, I need its full content to extract the  │
│  continuation accurately.\n\n    *   Tool 4: Python string manipulation     │
│  (after reading the file)\n        *   Purpose: To find the exact end of    │
│  the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n        *            │
│  Rationale: This is a crucial step for precise extraction. I will use       │
│  `str.find()` to locate the prefix and then slice the string. I will then   │
│  split the extracted text by spaces to count words and trim if              │
│  necessary.\n\n5. Expected Outcome:\n    The expected outcome is a plain    │
│  text continuation of the provided prefix, exactly 100-200 words long,      │
│  extracted verbatim from the source document. This aligns perfectly with    │
│  my goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing         │
│  maximally informative and precise context.', 'ready': True}                │

│          it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:                   │
│          it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full                 │
│          of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's                    │
│          good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against               │
│          me his natural brother: therefore use thy                          │

│          had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou                │

│  ROSALIND        I would we could do so, for her benefits are               │
│          mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman                  │
│          doth most mistake in her gifts to women.                           │

│  CELIA   No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she                 │
│          not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature                   │
│          hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not                    │

│          natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of               │
│          the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,                    │

│  LE BEAU The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the                 │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective): The task is to find the exact  │
│  continuation of a given text prefix. From a SIMDL perspective, this means  │
│  identifying the source document to achieve maximum compression (zero       │
│  entropy for the next tokens) by providing the exact sequence. The cost of  │
│  accessing external information (tools) is justified if it leads to a       │
│  significant reduction in prediction entropy. The context strongly          │
│  suggests a Shakespearean play, specifically "As You Like It."              │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      *   Step 1: Directory Analysis: List the contents of the               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand what potential      │
│  source documents are available.                                            │
│      *   Step 2: Targeted Search: Based on the prefix (Shakespeare, "As     │
│  You Like It"), I will search for files within the allowed directory that   │
│  contain the prefix.                                                        │
│      *   Step 3: Extract Continuation: Once the source file is identified,  │
│  I will read the file and extract the text immediately following the        │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│      *   Step 4: Verify and Format: Ensure the extracted continuation is    │
│  between 100-200 words and is in plain text format.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Challenges and Approach:                                                │
│      *   Challenge 1: Finding the exact source: The directory might         │
│  contain many files, or the specific play might not be immediately          │
│  obvious.                                                                   │
│          *   Approach: Use `list_directory` first to get an overview.       │
│  Then, use `search_files_content` with a distinctive part of the prefix to  │
│  pinpoint the exact file. The prefix contains dialogue with character       │
│  names, which are good search terms.                                        │
│      *   Challenge 2: Extracting the exact continuation: Once the file is   │
│  found, I need to accurately locate the end of the prefix and extract the   │
│  subsequent text.                                                           │
│          *   Approach: Read the entire file content using                   │
│  `read_text_file`. Then, use string manipulation (e.g., `find()` and        │
│  slicing) to get the text immediately after the prefix. I will need to be   │
│  careful with line breaks and formatting in the source text.                │
│      *   Challenge 3: Word count and formatting: Ensuring the output is     │
│  100-200 words and plain text.                                              │
│          *   Approach: After extracting the continuation, I will split it   │
│  into words and count them. If it's too short, I'll take more; if too       │
│  long, I'll trim it. I will ensure no markdown or extra commentary is       │
│  included.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│      *   Tool 1: `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`      │
│          *   Purpose: To get an initial overview of the files present in    │
│  the allowed directory. This helps in understanding the potential scope of  │
│  available "entropy sinks."                                                 │
│          *   Rationale: Before searching for specific content, it's good    │
│  to know what files are even present.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│      *   Tool 2:                                                            │
│  `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='You      │
│  tell us the manner of the wrestling.')`                                    │
│          *   Purpose: To locate the specific file containing the exact      │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│          *   Rationale: The prefix is quite specific, especially the last   │
│  line of dialogue. Searching for this exact phrase will likely lead         │
│  directly to the source document. I will use a distinctive part of the      │
│  prefix to minimize false positives.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│      *   Tool 3: `read_text_file(path='[identified_file_path]')`            │
│          *   Purpose: To read the entire content of the identified source   │
│  file.                                                                      │
│          *   Rationale: Once the file is found, I need its full content to  │
│  extract the continuation accurately.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│      *   Tool 4: Python string manipulation (after reading the file)        │
│          *   Purpose: To find the exact end of the prefix and extract the   │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.                                                  │
│          *   Rationale: This is a crucial step for precise extraction. I    │
│  will use `str.find()` to locate the prefix and then slice the string. I    │
│  will then split the extracted text by spaces to count words and trim if    │
│  necessary.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome:                                                       │
│      The expected outcome is a plain text continuation of the provided      │
│  prefix, exactly 100-200 words long, extracted verbatim from the source     │
│  document. This aligns perfectly with my goal of minimizing future token    │
│  prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and precise          │
│  context.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The task requires me to find the exact continuation of   │
│  the provided text prefix. The prefix appears to be from a play,            │
│  specifically Shakespeare's "As You Like It," given the character names     │
│  (CELIA, ROSALIND, TOUCHSTONE, LE BEAU) and the style of dialogue. My       │
│  strategy will be to first list the allowed directories to confirm I can    │
│  access the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` path. Then, I will search for    │
│  the specific text within that directory to identify the source file. Once  │
│  the file is found, I will read its content and extract the text            │
│  immediately following the prefix, ensuring it falls within the 100-200     │
│  word range.                                                                │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

Thought: I have read the entire content of the file `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/cantrbry/asyoulik.txt`. Now I need to extract the exact continuation that follows the given prefix.

The prefix ends with:
"ROSALIND You tell us the manner of the wrestling."

I will find this exact string in the `file_content` and then extract the subsequent text. I need to be careful about leading/trailing whitespace and line breaks. The extracted text should be between 100 and 200 words.

Let's define the prefix for searching:
`prefix_end = "ROSALIND\tYou tell us the manner of the wrestling."`

I will find the index of this string in the `file_content` and then take the text after it. I will then clean up any leading/trailing whitespace and count the words.LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
	your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
	yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
	to perform it.

CELIA	Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons,--

CELIA	I could match this beginning with an old tale.

LE BEAU	Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.

ROSALIND	With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
	by these presents.'

LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
	duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
	and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
