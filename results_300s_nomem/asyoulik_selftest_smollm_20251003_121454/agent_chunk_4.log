│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task from a SIMDL Perspective:**  │
│  My primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy. This       │
│  means providing the most precise, context-rich, and verbatim continuation  │
│  possible. The current prefix is from Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It".      │
│  Finding the exact next 100-200 words from the source document will         │
│  significantly reduce the language model\'s uncertainty about upcoming      │
│  tokens, thus achieving high compression gains under the SIMDL framework.   │
│  The cost of accessing external information (using tools) is justified by   │
│  the high information density and predictive power of an exact verbatim     │
│  continuation.\n\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**\n    a.            │
│  **Directory Analysis:** Begin by listing the contents of the allowed       │
│  directory (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to understand the available     │
│  files.\n    b. **Source Identification:** Search for files within this     │
│  directory that are likely to contain the text of "As You Like It". The     │
│  most efficient way is to search for the play\'s title.\n    c. **Content   │
│  Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, read its content.\n      │
│  d. **Prefix Location:** Locate the exact provided prefix within the read   │
│  content.\n    e. **Continuation Extraction:** Extract the 100-200 words    │
│  immediately following the prefix.\n    f. **Output Formatting:** Present   │
│  the extracted text as plain text only, without any additional commentary   │
│  or formatting.\n\n3. **Approach to Challenges:**\n    *   **Limited        │
│  Scope:** My knowledge sources are strictly limited to the                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I will not attempt to use        │
│  external web searches or Wikipedia, as these are not available through my  │
│  current toolset.\n    *   **File Identification:** If `list_directory`     │
│  reveals many files, `search_files_content` will be crucial to quickly      │
│  pinpoint the most relevant one. If `search_files_content` yields too many  │
│  results or none, I will need to iteratively inspect files based on their   │
│  names or common text file extensions.\n    *   **Exact Match:**            │
│  Shakespearean texts are generally stable. I will assume that any complete  │
│  text of "As You Like It" found will provide the exact continuation. If     │
│  multiple versions exist, I will prioritize the one that most closely       │
│  matches the formatting and style of the provided prefix.\n\n4.             │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**:       │
│  (Initial check, though the path is given) To confirm the accessible        │
│  directory.\n    *                                                          │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: To get an     │
│  overview of the files and subdirectories present in the designated sink.   │
│  This helps in forming an initial hypothesis about where the play might be  │
│  located.\n    *                                                            │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'AS  │
│  YOU LIKE IT\')`**: This is the most critical tool. I will use it to        │
│  efficiently scan all files in the sink directory for the exact title of    │
│  the play. This will likely lead me directly to the source document.\n      │
│  *   **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`**: Once a file          │
│  containing "AS YOU LIKE IT" is identified, I will use this tool to read    │
│  its entire content into memory for precise prefix matching and             │
│  continuation extraction.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:**\n    The expected     │
│  outcome is a plain text string containing the verbatim continuation        │
│  (100-200 words) of the provided prefix from "As You Like It". This output  │
│  will directly follow the last word of the prefix, "England", and will be   │
│  free of any formatting, analysis, or meta-text. This aligns perfectly      │
│  with my goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing    │
│  maximally informative and exact context.\n', 'ready': True}                │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │

│          brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my                     │
│          gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that                │
│          grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I                   │
│          think is within me, begins to mutiny against this                  │
│          servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I                │

│  1. **Understand the Task from a SIMDL Perspective:** My primary goal is    │
│  to minimize future token prediction entropy. This means providing the      │
│  most precise, context-rich, and verbatim continuation possible. The        │
│  current prefix is from Shakespeare's "As You Like It". Finding the exact   │
│  next 100-200 words from the source document will significantly reduce the  │
│  language model's uncertainty about upcoming tokens, thus achieving high    │
│  compression gains under the SIMDL framework. The cost of accessing         │
│  external information (using tools) is justified by the high information    │
│  density and predictive power of an exact verbatim continuation.            │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                     │

│  available files.                                                           │
│      b. **Source Identification:** Search for files within this directory   │
│  that are likely to contain the text of "As You Like It". The most          │
│  efficient way is to search for the play's title.                           │
│      c. **Content Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, read    │
│  its content.                                                               │
│      d. **Prefix Location:** Locate the exact provided prefix within the    │
│  read content.                                                              │
│      e. **Continuation Extraction:** Extract the 100-200 words immediately  │
│  following the prefix.                                                      │
│      f. **Output Formatting:** Present the extracted text as plain text     │
│  only, without any additional commentary or formatting.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│      *   **Limited Scope:** My knowledge sources are strictly limited to    │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I will not attempt to use    │
│  external web searches or Wikipedia, as these are not available through my  │
│  current toolset.                                                           │
│      *   **File Identification:** If `list_directory` reveals many files,   │
│  `search_files_content` will be crucial to quickly pinpoint the most        │
│  relevant one. If `search_files_content` yields too many results or none,   │
│  I will need to iteratively inspect files based on their names or common    │
│  text file extensions.                                                      │
│      *   **Exact Match:** Shakespearean texts are generally stable. I will  │
│  assume that any complete text of "As You Like It" found will provide the   │
│  exact continuation. If multiple versions exist, I will prioritize the one  │
│  that most closely matches the formatting and style of the provided         │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: (Initial check, though the path  │
│  is given) To confirm the accessible directory.                             │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get  │
│  an overview of the files and subdirectories present in the designated      │
│  sink. This helps in forming an initial hypothesis about where the play     │
│  might be located.                                                          │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='AS YOU LIKE IT')`**: This is the most critical tool. I will use it  │
│  to efficiently scan all files in the sink directory for the exact title    │
│  of the play. This will likely lead me directly to the source document.     │
│      *   **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`**: Once a file        │
│  containing "AS YOU LIKE IT" is identified, I will use this tool to read    │
│  its entire content into memory for precise prefix matching and             │
│  continuation extraction.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:**                                                   │
│      The expected outcome is a plain text string containing the verbatim    │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided prefix from "As You Like      │
│  It". This output will directly follow the last word of the prefix,         │
│  "England", and will be free of any formatting, analysis, or meta-text.     │
│  This aligns perfectly with my goal of minimizing future token prediction   │
│  entropy by providing maximally informative and exact context.              │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
