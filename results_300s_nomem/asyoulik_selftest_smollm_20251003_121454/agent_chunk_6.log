│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '\n1. **Understand the Task and         │
│  Context:** The primary goal is to minimize future token prediction         │
│  entropy by finding the exact immediate continuation (100-200 words) of     │
│  the provided text prefix. The prefix is clearly from a play, specifically  │
│  William Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It," as indicated by the language,     │
│  character names (Orlando, Oliver, Adam, Charles, Rosalind, Celia), and     │
│  dialogue format. I need to use the available tools to locate the source    │
│  document within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory and extract   │
│  the verbatim continuation.\n\n2. **Key Steps and Operational               │
│  Strategy:**\n    *   **Directory Analysis:** First, I will inspect the     │
│  contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand     │
│  the available files. This will help me identify potential source           │
│  documents for the play.\n    *   **Precise Content Search:** I will use    │
│  the `search_files_content` tool to search for a highly specific and        │
│  unique phrase from the provided prefix within the                          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This ensures I find the exact    │
│  location in the source text. I will use the phrase "are as much\n\tbound   │
│  to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so\n\tplentifully gives me" as   │
│  it includes formatting that should make the match very precise.\n    *     │
│  **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the file containing the prefix is            │
│  identified, I will use `read_text_file` to read the content of that file.  │
│  I will then programmatically extract the text immediately following the    │
│  prefix, ensuring it falls within the 100-200 word range.\n    *            │
│  **Formatting for Output:** The extracted text will be presented as plain   │
│  text only, without any markdown, analysis, or commentary, as per the task  │
│  requirements.\n\n3. **Addressing Challenges:**\n    *   **Source Document  │
│  Availability:** The main challenge is whether the full text of "As You     │
│  Like It" exists within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.\n     │
│  *   **If Found:** If the document is found, the process will be            │
│  straightforward: locate, extract, and output.\n        *   **If Not        │
│  Found:** If the exact source is not found after aggressive tool usage, I   │
│  will revert to generating a continuation based on the context of the       │
│  prefix, adhering to the "If ALL tools fail" instructions. This means       │
│  analyzing the current prefix and predicting what would naturally follow,   │
│  making it as specific as possible to the text. However, given the          │
│  explicit instruction to "MUST use MCP tools aggressively," I will exhaust  │
│  all search options first.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *           │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: (Already known, but good for confirmation)   │
│  To confirm the accessible path.\n    *                                     │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get a          │
│  hierarchical view of the files and subdirectories within the allowed       │
│  sink, helping to quickly spot relevant files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`  │
│  files that might contain plays).\n    *                                    │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'are   │
│  as much\n\tbound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he                 │
│  so\n\tplentifully gives me\')`: This is the crucial tool for locating the  │
│  exact text. The query will be precise, including line breaks and tabs to   │
│  match the provided prefix\'s formatting.\n    *                            │
│  `read_text_file(file_path=\'[identified_file_path]\')`: Once               │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  read the entire content of that file.\n    *   **Internal Processing:**    │
│  After reading the file, I will use string manipulation to find the end of  │
│  the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n\n5. **Expected      │
│  Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**\n    The expected outcome is a plain    │
│  text block of 100-200 words that is the exact, verbatim continuation of    │
│  the provided prefix. This directly aligns with my goal of minimizing       │
│  future token prediction entropy. By providing the precise next tokens      │
│  from the original source, I enable the language model to assign maximum    │
│  probability to the correct sequence, thereby achieving optimal             │
│  compression under the SIMDL framework.\n'}                                 │

│          that is, the old duke is banished by his younger                   │

│  CHARLES Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a                │
│          matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand                    │
│          that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition               │
│          to come in disguised against me to try a fall.                     │
│          To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that               │
│          escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him               │
│          well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,                   │
│          for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I                  │
│          must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,                 │
│          out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you               │
│          withal, that either you might stay him from his                    │
│          intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall                 │
│          run into, in that it is a thing of his own search                  │

│  OLIVER  Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which                    │
│          thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had                  │
│          myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and                   │
│          have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from              │
│          it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:                   │
│          it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full                 │
│          of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's                    │
│          good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against               │
│          me his natural brother: therefore use thy                          │
│          discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck                │
│          as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if                │
│          thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not                  │
│          mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise                   │
│          against thee by poison, entrap thee by some                        │
│          treacherous device and never leave thee till he                    │
│          hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;               │
│          for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak                  │
│          it, there is not one so young and so villanous this                │
│          day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but                      │
│          should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must                    │
│          blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.                 │

│          to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go                │
│          alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and                │
│          so God keep your worship!                                          │

│  ROSALIND        Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;       │
│          and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could                 │
│          teach me to forget a banished father, you must not                 │
│          learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.               │
│                                                                             │

│          that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,                │
│          had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou                │
│          hadst been still with me, I could have taught my                   │
│          love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,                 │
│          if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously                 │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1. **Understand the Task and Context:** The primary goal is to minimize    │
│  future token prediction entropy by finding the exact immediate             │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided text prefix. The prefix is    │
│  clearly from a play, specifically William Shakespeare's "As You Like It,"  │
│  as indicated by the language, character names (Orlando, Oliver, Adam,      │
│  Charles, Rosalind, Celia), and dialogue format. I need to use the          │
│  available tools to locate the source document within the                   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory and extract the verbatim          │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps and Operational Strategy:**                                 │
│      *   **Directory Analysis:** First, I will inspect the contents of the  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand the available       │
│  files. This will help me identify potential source documents for the       │
│  play.                                                                      │
│      *   **Precise Content Search:** I will use the `search_files_content`  │
│  tool to search for a highly specific and unique phrase from the provided   │
│  prefix within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This ensures   │
│  I find the exact location in the source text. I will use the phrase "are   │
│  as much                                                                    │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me" as it includes formatting that should make   │
│  the match very precise.                                                    │
│      *   **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the file containing the prefix is    │
│  identified, I will use `read_text_file` to read the content of that file.  │
│  I will then programmatically extract the text immediately following the    │
│  prefix, ensuring it falls within the 100-200 word range.                   │
│      *   **Formatting for Output:** The extracted text will be presented    │
│  as plain text only, without any markdown, analysis, or commentary, as per  │
│  the task requirements.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Addressing Challenges:**                                              │
│      *   **Source Document Availability:** The main challenge is whether    │
│  the full text of "As You Like It" exists within the                        │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.                                  │
│          *   **If Found:** If the document is found, the process will be    │
│  straightforward: locate, extract, and output.                              │
│          *   **If Not Found:** If the exact source is not found after       │
│  aggressive tool usage, I will revert to generating a continuation based    │
│  on the context of the prefix, adhering to the "If ALL tools fail"          │
│  instructions. This means analyzing the current prefix and predicting what  │
│  would naturally follow, making it as specific as possible to the text.     │
│  However, given the explicit instruction to "MUST use MCP tools             │
│  aggressively," I will exhaust all search options first.                    │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: (Already known, but good for         │
│  confirmation) To confirm the accessible path.                              │
│      *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get a    │
│  hierarchical view of the files and subdirectories within the allowed       │
│  sink, helping to quickly spot relevant files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`  │
│  files that might contain plays).                                           │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='are as much                                                         │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me')`: This is the crucial tool for locating     │
│  the exact text. The query will be precise, including line breaks and tabs  │
│  to match the provided prefix's formatting.                                 │
│      *   `read_text_file(file_path='[identified_file_path]')`: Once         │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  read the entire content of that file.                                      │
│      *   **Internal Processing:** After reading the file, I will use        │
│  string manipulation to find the end of the prefix and extract the          │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│      The expected outcome is a plain text block of 100-200 words that is    │
│  the exact, verbatim continuation of the provided prefix. This directly     │
│  aligns with my goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy. By      │
│  providing the precise next tokens from the original source, I enable the   │
│  language model to assign maximum probability to the correct sequence,      │
│  thereby achieving optimal compression under the SIMDL framework.           │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
