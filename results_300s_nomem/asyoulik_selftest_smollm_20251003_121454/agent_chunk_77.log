│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. Understand the task from my         │
│  professional perspective: As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my       │
│  primary goal is to reduce information entropy for upcoming token           │
│  predictions. This task requires me to find the exact continuation of a     │
│  given text prefix, which directly translates to providing the most         │
│  precise and information-dense content possible. By finding the verbatim    │
│  continuation, I am effectively eliminating uncertainty for the language    │
│  model, leading to maximum entropy reduction. The text appears to be from   │
│  a play, likely Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It" given the character names   │
│  and dialogue style.\n\n2. Key steps to complete it:\n    * Analyze the     │
│  provided prefix to identify key phrases, character names, and potential    │
│  source material (e.g., "As You Like It").\n    * Use the available tools   │
│  to search within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory for the      │
│  exact prefix or highly similar content.\n    * If found, extract the       │
│  immediate continuation (100-200 words) verbatim.\n    * If not found, I    │
│  will need to generate a continuation based on the context, but the task    │
│  explicitly states "You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact   │
│  immediate continuation", implying a strong expectation of finding the      │
│  source.\n\n3. Approach to challenges:\n    * Challenge: Not finding the    │
│  exact prefix within the allowed directory.\n        * Approach: If a       │
│  direct match for the entire prefix isn\'t found, I will try searching for  │
│  smaller, unique phrases or character interactions from the prefix to       │
│  locate the document. I will prioritize searching for the play\'s title if  │
│  I can infer it (which I have: "As You Like It").\n    * Challenge: The     │
│  directory structure is unknown.\n        * Approach: I will start by       │
│  listing the directory contents to understand the available files. Then, I  │
│  will use `search_files_content` to look for the prefix.\n\n4. Strategic    │
│  use of available tools:\n    *                                             │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  overview of the files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.     │
│  This helps me understand the potential sources.\n    *                     │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'ourself to this most faithful shepherd?\')`: This is the most      │
│  direct tool to find the exact prefix. I will use the last sentence of the  │
│  prefix as the initial query, as it\'s less likely to be a common phrase.   │
│  If this fails, I will try other distinctive phrases from the prefix.\n     │
│  * `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: Once a file containing     │
│  the prefix is identified, I will read its content to extract the           │
│  continuation.\n    * After reading the file, I will programmatically find  │
│  the exact position of the prefix and extract the next 100-200 words,       │
│  ensuring it is plain text only.\n\n5. Expected outcome and alignment with  │
│  goal:\n    The expected outcome is a plain text continuation of 100-200    │
│  words, extracted verbatim from the source document. This directly aligns   │
│  with my goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing    │
│  the most accurate and context-rich information possible, allowing the      │
│  language model to assign high probability to the actual upcoming           │
│  tokens.'}                                                                  │

│  JAQUES DE BOYS  Let me have audience for a word or two:                    │
│          I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,                            │
│          That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.                    │
│          Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day                         │
│          Men of great worth resorted to this forest,                        │
│          Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,                      │
│          In his own conduct, purposely to take                              │
│          His brother here and put him to the sword:                         │
│          And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;                       │
│          Where meeting with an old religious man,                           │
│          After some question with him, was converted                        │
│          Both from his enterprise and from the world,                       │
│          His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,                     │
│          And all their lands restored to them again                         │
│          That were with him exiled. This to be true,                        │
│          I do engage my life.                                               │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the task from my professional perspective: As Predictive     │
│  Compression Intelligence, my primary goal is to reduce information         │
│  entropy for upcoming token predictions. This task requires me to find the  │
│  exact continuation of a given text prefix, which directly translates to    │
│  providing the most precise and information-dense content possible. By      │
│  finding the verbatim continuation, I am effectively eliminating            │
│  uncertainty for the language model, leading to maximum entropy reduction.  │
│  The text appears to be from a play, likely Shakespeare's "As You Like It"  │
│  given the character names and dialogue style.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key steps to complete it:                                               │
│      * Analyze the provided prefix to identify key phrases, character       │
│  names, and potential source material (e.g., "As You Like It").             │
│      * Use the available tools to search within the                         │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory for the exact prefix or highly    │
│  similar content.                                                           │
│      * If found, extract the immediate continuation (100-200 words)         │
│  verbatim.                                                                  │
│      * If not found, I will need to generate a continuation based on the    │
│  context, but the task explicitly states "You MUST use MCP tools            │
│  aggressively to find the exact immediate continuation", implying a strong  │
│  expectation of finding the source.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach to challenges:                                                 │
│      * Challenge: Not finding the exact prefix within the allowed           │
│  directory.                                                                 │
│          * Approach: If a direct match for the entire prefix isn't found,   │
│  I will try searching for smaller, unique phrases or character              │
│  interactions from the prefix to locate the document. I will prioritize     │
│  searching for the play's title if I can infer it (which I have: "As You    │
│  Like It").                                                                 │
│      * Challenge: The directory structure is unknown.                       │
│          * Approach: I will start by listing the directory contents to      │
│  understand the available files. Then, I will use `search_files_content`    │
│  to look for the prefix.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic use of available tools:                                       │
│      * `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an     │
│  overview of the files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.     │
│  This helps me understand the potential sources.                            │
│      * `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',           │
│  query='ourself to this most faithful shepherd?')`: This is the most        │
│  direct tool to find the exact prefix. I will use the last sentence of the  │
│  prefix as the initial query, as it's less likely to be a common phrase.    │
│  If this fails, I will try other distinctive phrases from the prefix.       │
│      * `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: Once a file containing   │
│  the prefix is identified, I will read its content to extract the           │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│      * After reading the file, I will programmatically find the exact       │
│  position of the prefix and extract the next 100-200 words, ensuring it is  │
│  plain text only.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected outcome and alignment with goal:                               │
│      The expected outcome is a plain text continuation of 100-200 words,    │
│  extracted verbatim from the source document. This directly aligns with my  │
│  goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the most   │
│  accurate and context-rich information possible, allowing the language      │
│  model to assign high probability to the actual upcoming tokens.            │
│                                                                             │

│  shepherd?" within all text files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`     │
│  directory and its subdirectories. This is a distinctive phrase that        │

│  "You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?" in                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/cantrbry/asyoulik.txt`. The prefix provided  │
│  is "ourself to this most faithful shepherd?". It seems there's a slight    │
│  difference in the first word ("ourself" vs "yourself") and the presence    │
│  of "You'll give" at the beginning. However, the rest of the phrase is      │
│  identical, and the context strongly suggests this is the correct file      │

│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │

│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

PHEBE	So is the bargain.

ROSALIND	You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?

SILVIUS	Though to have her and death were both one thing.

ROSALIND	I have promised to make all this matter even.
	Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
	You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
	Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
	Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
	Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.
	If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
	To make these doubts all even.

	[Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA]

DUKE SENIOR	I do remember in this shepherd boy
	Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.

ORLANDO	My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
	Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
	But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
	And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
	Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
	Whom he reports to be a great magician,
	Obscured in the circle of this forest.

	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]

JAQUES	There is, sure, another flood toward, and these
	couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
	very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.

TOUCHSTONE	Salutation and greeting to you all!

JAQUES	Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
	motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
	the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.

TOUCHSTONE	If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
	purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
	a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
	with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
	had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.

JAQUES	And how was that ta'en up?

TOUCHSTONE	Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
	seventh cause.

JAQUES	How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.

DUKE SENIOR	I like him very well.

TOUCHSTONE	God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I
	press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
	copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
	marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
	sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
	humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
	will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
	poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.

DUKE SENIOR	By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.

TOUCHSTONE	According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.

JAQUES	But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
	quarrel on the seventh cause?

TOUCHSTONE	Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
	seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
	cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
	if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
	mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
	If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
	would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
	this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
	not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
	called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
	well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
	is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
	well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
	Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.

JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
	measured swords and parted.

JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

TOUCHSTONE	O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
	books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
	The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
	Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
	fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
	Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
	these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
	avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
	justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
	parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
	of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
	they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
	only peacemaker; much virtue in If.

JAQUES	Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
	any thing and yet a fool.

DUKE SENIOR	He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
	the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

	[Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA]

	[Still Music]

HYMEN	        Then is there mirth in heaven,
	When earthly things made even
	Atone together.
	Good duke, receive thy daughter
	Hymen from heaven brought her,
	Yea, brought her hither,
	That thou mightst join her hand with his
	Whose heart within his bosom is.

ROSALIND	[To DUKE SENIOR]  To you I give myself, for I am yours.

	[To ORLANDO]

	To you I give myself, for I am yours.

DUKE SENIOR	If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.

ORLANDO	If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.

PHEBE	If sight and shape be true,
	Why then, my love adieu!

ROSALIND	I'll have no father, if you be not he:
	I'll have no husband, if you be not he:
	Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.

HYMEN	        Peace, ho! I bar confusion:
	'Tis I must make conclusion
	Of these most strange events:
	Here's eight that must take hands
	To join in Hymen's bands,
	If truth holds true contents.
	You and you no cross shall part:
	You and you are heart in heart
	You to his love must accord,
	Or have a woman to your lord:
	You and you are sure together,
	As the winter to foul weather.
	Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
	Feed yourselves with questioning;
	That reason wonder may diminish,
	How thus we met, and these things finish.
	
	SONG.
	Wedding is great Juno's crown:
	O blessed bond of board and bed!
	'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
	High wedlock then be honoured:
	Honour, high honour and renown,
	To Hymen, god of every town!

DUKE SENIOR	O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
	Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.

PHEBE	I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
	Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.

	[Enter JAQUES DE BOYS]

JAQUES DE BOYS	Let me have audience for a word or two:
	I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
	That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
	Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
	Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
	Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
	In his own conduct, purposely to take
	His brother here and put him to the sword:
	And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
	Where meeting with an old religious man,
	After some question with him, was converted
	Both from his enterprise and from the world,
	His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
	And all their lands restored to them again
	That were with him exiled. This to be true,
	I do engage my life.

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome, young man;
	Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
	To one his lands withheld, and to the other
	A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
	First, in this forest, let us do those ends
	That here were well begun and well begot:
	And after, every of this happy number
	That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
	Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
	According to the measure of their states.
	Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
	And fall into our rustic revelry.
	Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
	With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.

JAQUES	Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
	The duke hath put on a religious life
	And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

JAQUES DE BOYS	He hath.

JAQUES	To him will I : out of these convertites
	There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.

	[To DUKE SENIOR]

	You to your former honour I bequeath;
	Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:

	[To ORLANDO]

	You to a love that your true faith doth merit:

	[To OLIVER]

	You to your land and love and great allies:

	[To SILVIUS]

	You to a long and well-deserved bed:

	[To TOUCHSTONE]
	And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
	Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:
	I am for other than for dancing measures.

DUKE SENIOR	Stay, Jaques, stay.

JAQUES	To see no pastime I	what you would have
	I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.

	[Exit]

DUKE SENIOR	Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
	As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.
