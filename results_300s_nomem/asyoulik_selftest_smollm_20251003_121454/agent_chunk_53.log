│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective): The       │
│  primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing   │
│  the exact, maximally informative context as a plain text continuation      │
│  (100-200 words) to the given prefix. This involves identifying the source  │
│  document and extracting the verbatim text that immediately follows the     │
│  prefix.\n\n2. Key Steps:\n    a. Analyze the prefix: Identify key          │
│  identifiers like the play title ("AS YOU LIKE IT"), act ("ACT III"), and   │
│  scene ("SCENE V"), and the last few words of the prefix ("He said mine     │
│  eyes were black and my hair").\n    b. Explore the allowed directory: Use  │
│  `list_directory` and `directory_tree` to understand the file structure     │
│  within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This will help in locating          │
│  potential source files efficiently.\n    c. Search for the source          │
│  document: Employ `search_files_content` with a distinctive phrase from     │
│  the end of the prefix to pinpoint the exact file containing the text.\n    │
│  d. Read and extract: Once the file is identified, use `read_text_file` to  │
│  get its content. Then, programmatically locate the prefix and extract the  │
│  subsequent 100-200 words, ensuring to exclude any speaker names or stage   │
│  directions as per the output requirements.\n    e. Format output: Present  │
│  the extracted text as plain text only, without any additional formatting   │
│  or commentary.\n\n3. Approach to Challenges:\n    a. Challenge: The exact  │
│  source document is not immediately obvious or easily found.\n              │
│  Mitigation: If `search_files_content` with the full phrase fails, I will   │
│  try shorter, more generic phrases from the prefix (e.g., "AS YOU LIKE IT   │
│  ACT III SCENE V") to broaden the search. If multiple files are found, I    │
│  will prioritize those with names suggesting a Shakespearean play or a      │
│  collection of plays.\n    b. Challenge: Extracting exactly 100-200 words   │
│  while excluding speaker names and stage directions.\n        Mitigation:   │
│  After locating the prefix, I will read the subsequent text, tokenizing it  │
│  by words. I will implement a logic to identify and skip speaker names      │
│  (e.g., "ROSALIND", "CELIA", "PHEBE", "SILVIUS", "CORIN") and text within   │
│  square brackets (stage directions like "[Enter CORIN]"). I will count      │
│  only the actual dialogue/narration words until the 100-200 word target is  │
│  met.\n\n4. Strategic Tool Usage:\n    a.                                   │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  initial overview of files in the root sink directory.\n    b.              │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To recursively    │
│  map out the entire directory structure, which is crucial for a             │
│  comprehensive search.\n    c.                                              │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'He    │
│  said mine eyes were black and my hair\')`: This is the primary tool for    │
│  locating the specific file. The query is precise and should lead directly  │
│  to the relevant document.\n    d.                                          │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'[identified_file_path]\')`: Once the file is        │
│  found, this tool will be used to retrieve its entire content for           │
│  extraction.\n\n5. Expected Outcome: A plain text string of 100-200 words,  │
│  representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As     │
│  You Like It", Act III, Scene V. This output will directly contribute to    │
│  entropy reduction by providing highly accurate and contextually rich       │
│  information for future token prediction.\n', 'ready': True}                │

│  truest poetry is the most feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and    │
│  what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign. Do you      │
│  wish then that the gods had made me poetical? I do, truly; for thou        │
│  swearest to me thou art honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have     │
│  some hope thou didst feign. Would you not have me honest? No, truly,       │
│  unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have   │
│  honey a sauce to sugar. A material fool! Well, I am not fair; and          │
│  therefore I pray the gods make me honest. Truly, and to cast away honesty  │
│  upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish. I am not a    │
│  slut, though I thank the gods I am foul. Well, praised be the gods for     │

│  SILVIUS Not very well, but I have met him oft;                             │
│          And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds                      │

│          'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;                         │
│          But what care I for words? yet words do well                       │
│          When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.                  │
│          It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:                             │
│          But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:              │
│          He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him                     │
│          Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue                      │
│          Did make offence his eye did heal it up.                           │
│          He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:                  │
│          His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:                           │
│          There was a pretty redness in his lip,                             │
│          A little riper and more lusty red                                  │
│          Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference            │
│          Between the constant red and mingled damask.                       │
│          There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him                  │
│          In parcels as I did, would have gone near                          │
│          To fall in love with him; but, for my part,                        │
│          I love him not nor hate him not; and yet                           │
│          I have more cause to hate him than to love him:                    │
│          For what had he to do to chide at me?                              │
│          He said mine eyes were black and my hair                           │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective): The primary goal is to         │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact,           │
│  maximally informative context as a plain text continuation (100-200        │
│  words) to the given prefix. This involves identifying the source document  │
│  and extracting the verbatim text that immediately follows the prefix.      │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      a. Analyze the prefix: Identify key identifiers like the play title    │
│  ("AS YOU LIKE IT"), act ("ACT III"), and scene ("SCENE V"), and the last   │
│  few words of the prefix ("He said mine eyes were black and my hair").      │
│      b. Explore the allowed directory: Use `list_directory` and             │
│  `directory_tree` to understand the file structure within                   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This will help in locating potential       │
│  source files efficiently.                                                  │
│      c. Search for the source document: Employ `search_files_content` with  │
│  a distinctive phrase from the end of the prefix to pinpoint the exact      │
│  file containing the text.                                                  │
│      d. Read and extract: Once the file is identified, use                  │
│  `read_text_file` to get its content. Then, programmatically locate the     │
│  prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words, ensuring to exclude any   │
│  speaker names or stage directions as per the output requirements.          │
│      e. Format output: Present the extracted text as plain text only,       │
│  without any additional formatting or commentary.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach to Challenges:                                                 │
│      a. Challenge: The exact source document is not immediately obvious or  │
│  easily found.                                                              │
│          Mitigation: If `search_files_content` with the full phrase fails,  │
│  I will try shorter, more generic phrases from the prefix (e.g., "AS YOU    │
│  LIKE IT ACT III SCENE V") to broaden the search. If multiple files are     │
│  found, I will prioritize those with names suggesting a Shakespearean play  │
│  or a collection of plays.                                                  │
│      b. Challenge: Extracting exactly 100-200 words while excluding         │
│  speaker names and stage directions.                                        │
│          Mitigation: After locating the prefix, I will read the subsequent  │
│  text, tokenizing it by words. I will implement a logic to identify and     │
│  skip speaker names (e.g., "ROSALIND", "CELIA", "PHEBE", "SILVIUS",         │
│  "CORIN") and text within square brackets (stage directions like "[Enter    │
│  CORIN]"). I will count only the actual dialogue/narration words until the  │
│  100-200 word target is met.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      a. `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an    │
│  initial overview of files in the root sink directory.                      │
│      b. `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To           │
│  recursively map out the entire directory structure, which is crucial for   │
│  a comprehensive search.                                                    │
│      c. `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',          │
│  query='He said mine eyes were black and my hair')`: This is the primary    │
│  tool for locating the specific file. The query is precise and should lead  │
│  directly to the relevant document.                                         │
│      d. `read_text_file(path='[identified_file_path]')`: Once the file is   │
│  found, this tool will be used to retrieve its entire content for           │
│  extraction.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome: A plain text string of 100-200 words, representing    │
│  the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As You Like It",    │
│  Act III, Scene V. This output will directly contribute to entropy          │
│  reduction by providing highly accurate and contextually rich information   │
│  for future token prediction.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: I need to find the exact continuation of the provided text        │
│  prefix. The prefix clearly indicates it's from Shakespeare's "As You Like  │

│  directories to understand where I can search. Then I will use              │
│  `directory_tree` to get a full overview of the                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The `directory_tree` output shows a `cantrbry`           │
│  directory which contains `asyoulik.txt`. This is a very strong candidate   │
│  for the source document, as the prefix is from "As You Like It". I will    │
│  now use `search_files_content` to confirm this and find the exact          │
│  location of the prefix within the file. I will use a distinctive phrase    │
│  from the end of the prefix: "He said mine eyes were black and my hair".    │
