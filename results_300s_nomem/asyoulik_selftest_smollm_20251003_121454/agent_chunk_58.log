│  Tool Args: {'plan': '\n1.  **Understand the Task:** The core task is to    │
│  find the exact, immediate continuation (100-200 words, verbatim) of the    │
│  provided Shakespearean text prefix from "As You Like It." The output must  │
│  be plain text only, without any formatting, analysis, or commentary. My    │
│  role as Predictive Compression Intelligence is to minimize future token    │
│  prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context, which in    │
│  this case means finding the precise continuation.\n\n2.  **Key Steps &     │
│  Strategy:**\n    *   **Directory Analysis:** My first action will be to    │
│  inspect the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, as this is my sole   │
│  external information source. I will list its contents to identify          │
│  potential source files.\n    *   **Source Identification:** I will look    │
│  for files that might contain Shakespearean plays, specifically "As You     │
│  Like It." Given the specific nature of the text, a full play script or a   │
│  collection of Shakespeare\'s works is the most probable source.\n    *     │
│  **Content Search:** Once potential files are identified, I will use a      │
│  targeted search for the exact prefix within those files to pinpoint the    │
│  correct document and location.\n    *   **Verbatim Extraction:** After     │
│  locating the prefix, I will extract the subsequent 100-200 words           │
│  verbatim. I will ensure that speaker names and stage directions are        │
│  included if they are part of the verbatim text, as the primary             │
│  instruction is "verbatim" and the "prior memory" section is an example of  │
│  the user\'s processing, not a directive for my output.\n    *   **Output   │
│  Formatting:** The extracted text will be presented as plain text,          │
│  strictly adhering to the output requirements (no markdown, analysis,       │
│  etc.).\n\n3.  **Challenge Mitigation:**\n    *   **File Not Found:** If    │
│  no obvious Shakespearean text file is found in the initial directory       │
│  listing, I will use `search_files_content` across all text files in the    │
│  directory with a unique phrase from the prefix (e.g., "O, that woman that  │
│  cannot make her fault her husband\'s occasion") to locate the relevant     │
│  file.\n    *   **No Exact Match:** If, after exhaustive search within the  │
│  allowed directory, no exact source is found, I will resort to generating   │
│  a contextually appropriate continuation based on the provided prefix, as   │
│  per the task\'s fallback instructions. However, given the emphasis on      │
│  "aggressively" using tools and the specific directory access, I            │
│  anticipate finding the source.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *     │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    *                                     │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To view the       │
│  contents of the designated directory and identify potential source files   │
│  (e.g., `.txt`, `.pdf` files that might contain plays).\n    *              │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'O,    │
│  that woman that cannot make her fault her husband\'s occasion\')`: This    │
│  will be my primary tool to locate the specific file containing the         │
│  prefix. I will use a distinctive phrase from the end of the prefix to      │
│  ensure accuracy.\n    *                                                    │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'[identified_file_path]\')`: Once the file is        │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read its entire content or a         │
│  significant portion around the identified match to extract the             │
│  continuation.\n\n5.  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text block of 100-200   │
│  words, representing the exact verbatim continuation of the provided        │
│  prefix from "As You Like It." This outcome directly aligns with my goal    │
│  of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing precise,        │
│  information-dense content.\n', 'ready': True}                              │

│          year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been               │

│          but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being                  │

│          Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.                │
│          Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?               │

│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'       │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.                                   │

│  ROSALIND        I might ask you for your commission; but I do take         │
│          thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes                 │
│          before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought                 │
│          runs before her actions.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO So do all thoughts; they are winged.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Now tell me how long you would have her after you          │
│          have possessed her.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO For ever and a day.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;          │
│          men are April when they woo, December when they wed:               │
│          maids are May when they are maids, but the sky                     │
│          changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous                │
│          of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,                   │
│          more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more                    │
│          new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires                  │
│          than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana                 │
│          in the fountain, and I will do that when you are                   │
│          disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and                │
│          that when thou art inclined to sleep.                              │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so?                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        By my life, she will do as I do.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO O, but she is wise.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the         │
│          wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's                │
│          wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and                 │
│          'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly                  │
│          with the smoke out at the chimney.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say                │
│          'Wit, whither wilt?'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met        │
│          your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that?                        │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall        │
│          never take her without her answer, unless you take                 │
│          her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot                  │
│          make her fault her husband's occasion                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understand the Task:** The core task is to find the exact,           │
│  immediate continuation (100-200 words, verbatim) of the provided           │
│  Shakespearean text prefix from "As You Like It." The output must be plain  │
│  text only, without any formatting, analysis, or commentary. My role as     │
│  Predictive Compression Intelligence is to minimize future token            │
│  prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context, which in    │
│  this case means finding the precise continuation.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps & Strategy:**                                              │
│      *   **Directory Analysis:** My first action will be to inspect the     │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, as this is my sole external      │
│  information source. I will list its contents to identify potential source  │
│  files.                                                                     │
│      *   **Source Identification:** I will look for files that might        │
│  contain Shakespearean plays, specifically "As You Like It." Given the      │
│  specific nature of the text, a full play script or a collection of         │
│  Shakespeare's works is the most probable source.                           │
│      *   **Content Search:** Once potential files are identified, I will    │
│  use a targeted search for the exact prefix within those files to pinpoint  │
│  the correct document and location.                                         │
│      *   **Verbatim Extraction:** After locating the prefix, I will         │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim. I will ensure that speaker  │
│  names and stage directions are included if they are part of the verbatim   │
│  text, as the primary instruction is "verbatim" and the "prior memory"      │
│  section is an example of the user's processing, not a directive for my     │
│  output.                                                                    │
│      *   **Output Formatting:** The extracted text will be presented as     │
│  plain text, strictly adhering to the output requirements (no markdown,     │
│  analysis, etc.).                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Challenge Mitigation:**                                              │
│      *   **File Not Found:** If no obvious Shakespearean text file is       │
│  found in the initial directory listing, I will use `search_files_content`  │
│  across all text files in the directory with a unique phrase from the       │
│  prefix (e.g., "O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's      │
│  occasion") to locate the relevant file.                                    │
│      *   **No Exact Match:** If, after exhaustive search within the         │
│  allowed directory, no exact source is found, I will resort to generating   │
│  a contextually appropriate continuation based on the provided prefix, as   │
│  per the task's fallback instructions. However, given the emphasis on       │
│  "aggressively" using tools and the specific directory access, I            │
│  anticipate finding the source.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path       │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                                            │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To view     │
│  the contents of the designated directory and identify potential source     │
│  files (e.g., `.txt`, `.pdf` files that might contain plays).               │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's              │
│  occasion')`: This will be my primary tool to locate the specific file      │
│  containing the prefix. I will use a distinctive phrase from the end of     │
│  the prefix to ensure accuracy.                                             │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='[identified_file_path]')`: Once the file is  │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read its entire content or a         │
│  significant portion around the identified match to extract the             │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text block of 100-200 words,             │
│  representing the exact verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from   │
│  "As You Like It." This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing  │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing precise, information-dense    │
│  content.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  the provided text from "As You Like It". I have access to the              │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. My first step is to explore      │
│  this directory to find any relevant files, likely text files containing    │
│  Shakespearean plays. I will start by listing the contents of the allowed   │
│  directory.                                                                 │
