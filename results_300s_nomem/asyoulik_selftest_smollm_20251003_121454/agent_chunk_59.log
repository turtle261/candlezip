│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. Understand the Task: The core task  │
│  is to find the exact immediate continuation (100-200 words) of a given     │
│  text prefix. This is a predictive compression task where providing the     │
│  exact continuation minimizes entropy. The source is highly likely to be a  │
│  Shakespearean play, specifically "As You Like It," given the characters    │
│  and dialogue style. I must use the provided tools to locate this source    │
│  within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.\n\n2. Key Steps:\n    │
│  *   Directory Analysis: List the contents of                               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to identify potential source files (e.g.,   │
│  `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.doc` files that might contain plays).\n    *   File      │
│  Identification: Based on the file names or initial inspection, prioritize  │
│  files that seem like they could contain literary works or plays.\n    *    │
│  Content Search: Use `search_files_content` to search for a distinctive     │
│  part of the prefix within the identified files. A good search string       │
│  would be a unique sentence or a combination of character names and         │
│  dialogue. For example, "Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour    │
│  affection in, it runs out." or "O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz,     │
│  that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love!"\n    *            │
│  Extraction: Once the prefix is located, use `read_text_file` or            │
│  `read_file_lines` to extract the text immediately following the prefix,    │
│  ensuring it falls within the 100-200 word range.\n    *   Formatting:      │
│  Remove speaker names and stage directions from the extracted text to       │
│  produce a plain text continuation.\n\n3. Challenges and Mitigation:\n      │
│  *   No obvious file names: If file names are not descriptive, I will have  │
│  to inspect more files. I can use `head_file` on a few files to get a       │
│  quick sense of their content.\n    *   Prefix not found: If the prefix is  │
│  not found using `search_files_content`, I will try different, shorter, or  │
│  more unique parts of the prefix. If still unsuccessful, I will consider    │
│  reading entire files that seem relevant and manually searching.\n    *     │
│  Output format: Ensure strict adherence to the "plain text continuation     │
│  only" rule, removing all extraneous information.\n\n4. Strategic Tool      │
│  Usage:\n    *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible    │
│  directory. (Already known: `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`)\n    *          │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To see what       │
│  files are present.\n    *                                                  │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'O     │
│  coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom  │
│  deep I am in love!\')`: This is a very specific and unique phrase from     │
│  the end of the prefix, making it an excellent search query. I will search  │
│  for this within the `/sink` directory.\n    *                              │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: Once the file is             │
│  identified, I will read its content to extract the continuation. I might   │
│  need to use `read_file_lines` if the file is very large and I only need a  │
│  specific section.\n\n5. Expected Outcome: A plain text string of 100-200   │
│  words that is the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix, with       │
│  speaker names and stage directions removed. This will directly reduce      │
│  prediction entropy by providing the exact next tokens.\n'}                 │

│  ROSALIND        No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is              │
│          almost six thousand years old, and in all this time                │
│          there was not any man died in his own person,                      │
│          videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains                 │
│          dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he                 │
│          could to die before, and he is one of the patterns                 │
│          of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair                  │
│          year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been               │
│          for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went                │
│          but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being                  │
│          taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish                   │
│          coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'                │
│          But these are all lies: men have died from time to                 │
│          time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,                   │
│          for, I protest, her frown might kill me.                           │

│          disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant                │
│          it.                                                                │

│          more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more                    │
│          new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires                  │
│          than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana                 │
│          in the fountain, and I will do that when you are                   │
│          disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and                │
│          that when thou art inclined to sleep.                              │

│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the Task: The core task is to find the exact immediate       │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of a given text prefix. This is a predictive  │
│  compression task where providing the exact continuation minimizes          │
│  entropy. The source is highly likely to be a Shakespearean play,           │
│  specifically "As You Like It," given the characters and dialogue style. I  │
│  must use the provided tools to locate this source within the               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      *   Directory Analysis: List the contents of                           │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to identify potential source files (e.g.,   │
│  `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.doc` files that might contain plays).                    │
│      *   File Identification: Based on the file names or initial            │
│  inspection, prioritize files that seem like they could contain literary    │
│  works or plays.                                                            │
│      *   Content Search: Use `search_files_content` to search for a         │
│  distinctive part of the prefix within the identified files. A good search  │
│  string would be a unique sentence or a combination of character names and  │
│  dialogue. For example, "Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour    │
│  affection in, it runs out." or "O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz,     │
│  that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love!"                   │
│      *   Extraction: Once the prefix is located, use `read_text_file` or    │
│  `read_file_lines` to extract the text immediately following the prefix,    │
│  ensuring it falls within the 100-200 word range.                           │
│      *   Formatting: Remove speaker names and stage directions from the     │
│  extracted text to produce a plain text continuation.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Challenges and Mitigation:                                              │
│      *   No obvious file names: If file names are not descriptive, I will   │
│  have to inspect more files. I can use `head_file` on a few files to get a  │
│  quick sense of their content.                                              │
│      *   Prefix not found: If the prefix is not found using                 │
│  `search_files_content`, I will try different, shorter, or more unique      │
│  parts of the prefix. If still unsuccessful, I will consider reading        │
│  entire files that seem relevant and manually searching.                    │
│      *   Output format: Ensure strict adherence to the "plain text          │
│  continuation only" rule, removing all extraneous information.              │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible            │
│  directory. (Already known: `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`)                 │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To see      │
│  what files are present.                                                    │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how     │
│  many fathom deep I am in love!')`: This is a very specific and unique      │
│  phrase from the end of the prefix, making it an excellent search query. I  │
│  will search for this within the `/sink` directory.                         │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: Once the file is       │
│  identified, I will read its content to extract the continuation. I might   │
│  need to use `read_file_lines` if the file is very large and I only need a  │
│  specific section.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome: A plain text string of 100-200 words that is the      │
│  verbatim continuation of the provided prefix, with speaker names and       │
│  stage directions removed. This will directly reduce prediction entropy by  │
│  providing the exact next tokens.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
