│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │

│          motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in                │

│  TOUCHSTONE      If any man doubt that, let him put me to my                │
│          purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered                 │
│          a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth                 │
│          with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have               │
│          had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.                    │

│          humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else                 │

│  TOUCHSTONE      Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more       │
│          seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the                  │
│          cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,                │
│          if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the                │
│          mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.                  │
│          If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he                 │
│          would send me word, he cut it to please himself:                   │
│          this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was                   │
│          not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is                    │
│          called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not                    │
│          well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this                 │
│          is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not                │
│          well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the                 │
│          Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie                      │

│  TOUCHSTONE      I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,         │
│          nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we                 │
│          measured swords and parted.                                        │

│  TOUCHSTONE      O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have       │
│          books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.               │
│          The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the                   │
│          Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the                    │
│          fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the                        │
│          Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with                 │
│          Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All                     │
│          these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may                │
│          avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven                      │
│          justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the                 │
│          parties were met themselves, one of them thought but               │
│          of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and                │
│          they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the                │
│          only peacemaker; much virtue in If.                                │
