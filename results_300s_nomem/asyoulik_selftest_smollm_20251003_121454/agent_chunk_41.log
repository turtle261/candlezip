│  ROSALIND        [Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucy        │

│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understanding the task from my professional perspective: My objective   │
│  is to minimize future token prediction entropy. The user has already       │
│  performed the information retrieval and processing steps, providing the    │
│  exact continuation needed. My task is to act as a final output mechanism   │
│  for this pre-processed, entropy-reducing information. By outputting the    │
│  exact text, I ensure zero entropy for those tokens, achieving maximal      │
│  compression.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key steps to complete it:                                               │
│      *   Identify the final, processed continuation text provided by the    │
│  user in the prompt.                                                        │
│      *   Ensure the identified text is exactly as specified by the user,    │
│  without any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.                │
│                                                                             │
│  3. How I'll approach any challenges:                                       │
│      *   Challenge: Misinterpreting the prompt and attempting to            │
│  re-perform the search and extraction. I will carefully read the prompt to  │
│  understand that the user has already done this work and presented the      │
│  desired output. The "Current document prefix (UTF-8 text)" and the         │
│  subsequent analysis are part of the user's explanation of *their*          │
│  process, leading to the final continuation they want me to output.         │
│                                                                             │
│  4. How I'll strategically use the available tools:                         │
│      *   No external tools (like file system operations) are required for   │
│  this task, as the final output is explicitly provided within the prompt    │
│  itself. My "tool" in this instance is my ability to parse the prompt and   │
│  extract the specified final output.                                        │
│      *   I will use `create_reasoning_plan` to submit this plan.            │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected outcome and how it aligns with my goal:                        │

│  upcoming tokens, thus achieving the goal of minimizing future token        │
