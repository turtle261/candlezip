│  LE BEAU The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the                 │
│          duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him               │
│          and broke three of his ribs, that there is little                  │
│          hope of life in him: so he served the second, and                  │

│  TOUCHSTONE      Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first         │
│          time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport                  │
│          for ladies.                                                        │

│          years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's                     │
│          strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or                    │
│          knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your                 │
│          adventure would counsel you to a more equal                        │
│          enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to                     │

│          so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let                    │
│          your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my                  │
│          trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one                    │
│          shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one                 │
│          dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my                      │
│          friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the                │
