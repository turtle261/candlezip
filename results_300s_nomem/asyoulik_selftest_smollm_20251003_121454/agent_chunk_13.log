│          To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved                      │
│          High commendation, true applause and love,                         │
│          Yet such is now the duke's condition                               │
│          That he misconstrues all that you have done.                       │
│          The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,                           │
│          More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:                     │
│          Which of the two was daughter of the duke                          │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Confirm allowed directory: Use `list_allowed_directories()` to ensure   │
│  I am operating within the correct scope.                                   │
│  2. Inspect directory contents: Use                                         │
│  `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` to get an overview   │
│  of the files in the sink. This helps me anticipate file types and          │
│  potential search strategies.                                               │
│  3. Search for the prefix: Use                                              │
│  `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='Which    │
│  of the two was daughter of the duke')`. This is the most direct way to     │
│  find the source.                                                           │
│  4. Extract and verify continuation:                                        │
│      * Once `search_files_content` returns a file path, use                 │
│  `read_text_file(path='<file_path>')` to get the full content of that       │
│  file.                                                                      │
│      * Locate the exact prefix "Which of the two was daughter of the duke"  │
│  within the file content.                                                   │
│      * Extract the text immediately following the prefix.                   │
│      * Count the words in the extracted continuation.                       │
│      * Adjust the length of the extracted text to be between 100 and 200    │
│  words, ensuring it's a natural continuation.                               │
│  5. Output the continuation: Present the extracted text as plain text       │
│  only.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
