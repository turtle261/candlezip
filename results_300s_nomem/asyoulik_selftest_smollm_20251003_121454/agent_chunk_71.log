│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Analyze the prefix:** The provided text is       │
│  clearly from William Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It," specifically         │
│  concluding Act V, Scene II, and transitioning into Act V, Scene III. The   │
│  task requires finding the exact continuation after the "[Exeunt]" marking  │
│  the end of Scene II.\n\n2. **Identify the exact location for               │
│  continuation:** The prefix ends with the stage direction "[Exeunt]"        │
│  followed by the play title and scene heading: "AS YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE  │
│  III". The continuation should start immediately after this heading.\n\n3.  │
│  **Search for the source document:** I will use the `search_files_content`  │
│  tool to locate the file containing "As You Like It" within the             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. A highly specific search query   │
│  will be "AS YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE III" to directly pinpoint the          │
│  relevant section of the play.\n\n4. **Extract the continuation:**\n    *   │
│  Once the file is identified, I will use `read_text_file` to access its     │
│  full content.\n    *   I will then programmatically or manually locate     │
│  the exact string "AS YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE III" and the subsequent       │
│  text.\n    *   The goal is to extract the next 100-200 words verbatim,     │
│  starting from the beginning of Act V, Scene III, including character       │
│  names and stage directions as they appear in the source.\n\n5. **Format    │
│  the output:** The extracted text will be presented as plain text only,     │
│  without any markdown, analysis, commentary, or additional formatting, to   │
│  directly serve as the token prediction.\n\n**Challenges and                │
│  Mitigation:**\n*   **Locating the file:** If the initial                   │
│  `search_files_content` with "AS YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE III" fails, I      │
│  will broaden the search to "As You Like It" or list the directory          │
│  contents to manually inspect file names for likely candidates.\n*          │
│  **Exactness and word count:** I will meticulously verify the extracted     │
│  text against the source to ensure it is a verbatim continuation. I will    │
│  also carefully count the words to ensure it falls within the 100-200 word  │
│  range, adjusting the start/end points if necessary to meet the criteria    │
│  while maintaining natural linguistic flow.\n\n**Strategic Tool             │
│  Usage:**\n*   `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To  │
│  get an initial overview of the files in the designated directory.\n*       │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'AS    │
│  YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE III\')`: This is the primary tool for finding the  │
│  specific document containing the play and the exact scene.\n*              │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: To retrieve the content of   │
│  the identified source document for extraction.\n\n**Expected               │
│  Outcome:**\nA plain text block of 100-200 words, representing the          │
│  verbatim continuation of "As You Like It," starting from Act V, Scene      │
│  III. This outcome directly supports my objective of entropy minimization   │
│  by providing maximally informative and precise context for future token    │
│  predictions, thereby reducing the expected description length.\n',         │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Analyze the prefix:** The provided text is clearly from William       │
│  Shakespeare's "As You Like It," specifically concluding Act V, Scene II,   │
│  and transitioning into Act V, Scene III. The task requires finding the     │
│  exact continuation after the "[Exeunt]" marking the end of Scene II.       │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Identify the exact location for continuation:** The prefix ends with  │
│  the stage direction "[Exeunt]" followed by the play title and scene        │
│  heading: "AS YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE III". The continuation should start   │
│  immediately after this heading.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Search for the source document:** I will use the                      │
│  `search_files_content` tool to locate the file containing "As You Like     │
│  It" within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. A highly          │
│  specific search query will be "AS YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE III" to          │
│  directly pinpoint the relevant section of the play.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Extract the continuation:**                                           │
│      *   Once the file is identified, I will use `read_text_file` to        │
│  access its full content.                                                   │
│      *   I will then programmatically or manually locate the exact string   │
│  "AS YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE III" and the subsequent text.                  │
│      *   The goal is to extract the next 100-200 words verbatim, starting   │
│  from the beginning of Act V, Scene III, including character names and      │
│  stage directions as they appear in the source.                             │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Format the output:** The extracted text will be presented as plain    │
│  text only, without any markdown, analysis, commentary, or additional       │
│  formatting, to directly serve as the token prediction.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  **Challenges and Mitigation:**                                             │
│  *   **Locating the file:** If the initial `search_files_content` with "AS  │
│  YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE III" fails, I will broaden the search to "As You   │
│  Like It" or list the directory contents to manually inspect file names     │
│  for likely candidates.                                                     │
│  *   **Exactness and word count:** I will meticulously verify the           │
│  extracted text against the source to ensure it is a verbatim               │
│  continuation. I will also carefully count the words to ensure it falls     │
│  within the 100-200 word range, adjusting the start/end points if           │
│  necessary to meet the criteria while maintaining natural linguistic flow.  │
│                                                                             │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                                  │
│  *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an       │
│  initial overview of the files in the designated directory.                 │
│  *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='AS   │
│  YOU LIKE IT ACT V SCENE III')`: This is the primary tool for finding the   │
│  specific document containing the play and the exact scene.                 │
│  *   `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: To retrieve the content    │
│  of the identified source document for extraction.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  **Expected Outcome:**                                                      │
│  A plain text block of 100-200 words, representing the verbatim             │
│  continuation of "As You Like It," starting from Act V, Scene III. This     │
│  outcome directly supports my objective of entropy minimization by          │
│  providing maximally informative and precise context for future token       │
│  predictions, thereby reducing the expected description length.             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
