│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │

│  ROSALIND        By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with        │

│          withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops                    │

│  ROSALIND        Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the         │
│          contract of her marriage and the day it is                         │
│          solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,                     │
│          Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of                 │
│          seven year.                                                        │

│  ROSALIND        With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that         │
│          hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because               │
│          he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because               │
│          he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean               │
│          and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden                 │
│          of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Who doth he gallop withal?                                         │

│  ROSALIND        With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as           │
│          softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.         │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Who stays it still withal?                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between       │
│          term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.           │
│                                                                             │

│  ROSALIND        With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the              │
│          skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.                │
│                                                                             │

│  ORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could                      │
│          purchase in so removed a dwelling.                                 │

│  ROSALIND        I have been told so of many: but indeed an old             │
│          religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was                │
│          in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship                │
│          too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard                  │
│          him read many lectures against it, and I thank God                 │
│          I am not a woman, to be touched with so many                       │
│          giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their                    │
│          whole sex withal.                                                  │

│  ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he                │
│          laid to the charge of women?                                       │

│  ROSALIND        There were none principal; they were all like one          │
│          another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming                 │
│          monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.                  │
│                                                                             │

│  ROSALIND        No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that       │
│          are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that                   │
│          abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on                 │
│          their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies                 │
│          on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of                   │
│          Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would                │
│          give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the               │
│          quotidian of love upon him.                                        │

│  ORLANDO I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me                 │
│          your remedy.                                                       │

│  ROSALIND        There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he             │
│          taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage                 │
│          of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.                          │

│  ROSALIND        A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and           │
│          sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable                      │
│          spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,                     │
│          which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for                 │
│          simply your having in beard is a younger brother's                 │
│          revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your                 │
│          bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe                 │
│          untied and every thing about you demonstrating a                   │
│          careless desolation; but you are no such man; you                  │
│          are rather point-device in your accoutrements as                   │
│          loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.               │

│  ROSALIND        Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you           │
│          love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to                 │

│          the reason why they are not so punished and cured                  │
│          is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers               │
│          are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.               │

│  ROSALIND        Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me         │
│          his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to                 │
│          woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish                 │

│          inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every               │
