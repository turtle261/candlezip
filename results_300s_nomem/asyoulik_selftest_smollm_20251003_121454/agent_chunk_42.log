│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Understand the Task from a SIMDL  │
│  Perspective:** My primary goal is to minimize future token prediction      │
│  entropy. This means providing the most accurate, information-dense         │
│  continuation possible. Accessing external information (the allowed         │
│  directory via tools) is a measured cost to achieve this entropy            │
│  reduction. Finding the exact verbatim continuation is the ideal outcome    │
│  as it provides maximum information gain.\n\n2. **Key Steps to Complete     │
│  the Task:**\n    a. **Directory Analysis:** First, I need to understand    │
│  the available "entropy sink" by listing the contents of the                │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This will inform which files I   │
│  can search.\n    b. **Prefix Location:** I will then use a search tool to  │
│  locate the exact prefix "By heavenly" within the files identified in the   │
│  previous step. This is crucial for pinpointing the source document.\n      │
│  c. **Content Extraction:** Once the prefix is located in a specific file,  │
│  I will read the content of that file. I will then manually identify the    │
│  exact point where the prefix ends and extract the subsequent 100-200       │
│  words.\n    d. **Filtering and Formatting:** During extraction, I will     │
│  meticulously exclude speaker names and stage directions as specified. The  │
│  final output will be strictly plain text, devoid of any formatting,        │
│  lists, headings, or commentary.\n\n3. **Approach to Challenges:**\n    a.  │
│  **Multiple Occurrences:** If "By heavenly" appears multiple times, I will  │
│  analyze the surrounding context of each occurrence to determine which one  │
│  aligns with the "Prior memory" provided in the prompt, ensuring I select   │
│  the correct source.\n    b. **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content`  │
│  fails to find the prefix, or if the identified file does not contain       │
│  enough continuation, I will revert to the fallback strategy of generating  │
│  a continuation based on the current prefix context only, ensuring it is    │
│  specific and avoids generic text. However, given the explicit instruction  │
│  to use MCP tools aggressively and the nature of the task, I anticipate     │
│  finding the exact source.\n    c. **Word Count Precision:** I will         │
│  perform a careful word count after initial extraction and adjust the       │
│  length to be within the 100-200 word range, prioritizing accuracy and      │
│  natural flow.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    a.                      │
│  **`list_allowed_directories()`:** To confirm the accessible directory and  │
│  ensure I am operating within the allowed scope.\n    b.                    │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`:** To get a      │
│  list of all files within the designated sink directory. This helps me      │
│  understand the potential source documents.\n    c.                         │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'By  │
│  heavenly\')`:** This is the most critical tool for efficiently locating    │
│  the prefix within the files. It will provide the file path(s) where the    │
│  prefix exists.\n    d.                                                     │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'file_path_from_search\')`:** Once the relevant    │
│  file is identified, this tool will be used to read its entire content,     │
│  allowing me to manually locate the prefix and extract the                  │
│  continuation.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**\n        │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text string containing the verbatim        │
│  continuation of 100-200 words following "By heavenly", with speaker names  │
│  and stage directions removed. This outcome directly aligns with my goal    │
│  of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing maximally       │
│  informative and precise context. By supplying the exact continuation, I    │
│  enable the language model to assign high probability to the actual         │
│  upcoming tokens, thereby achieving significant compression gains under     │
│  the SIMDL framework.'}                                                     │

│  to minimize future token prediction entropy. This means providing the      │
│  most accurate, information-dense continuation possible. Accessing          │
│  external information (the allowed directory via tools) is a measured cost  │
│  to achieve this entropy reduction. Finding the exact verbatim              │
│  continuation is the ideal outcome as it provides maximum information       │
│  gain.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                     │
│      a. **Directory Analysis:** First, I need to understand the available   │
│  "entropy sink" by listing the contents of the                              │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This will inform which files I   │
│  can search.                                                                │
│      b. **Prefix Location:** I will then use a search tool to locate the    │
│  exact prefix "By heavenly" within the files identified in the previous     │
│  step. This is crucial for pinpointing the source document.                 │
│      c. **Content Extraction:** Once the prefix is located in a specific    │
│  file, I will read the content of that file. I will then manually identify  │
│  the exact point where the prefix ends and extract the subsequent 100-200   │
│  words.                                                                     │
│      d. **Filtering and Formatting:** During extraction, I will             │
│  meticulously exclude speaker names and stage directions as specified. The  │
│  final output will be strictly plain text, devoid of any formatting,        │
│  lists, headings, or commentary.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│      a. **Multiple Occurrences:** If "By heavenly" appears multiple times,  │
│  I will analyze the surrounding context of each occurrence to determine     │
│  which one aligns with the "Prior memory" provided in the prompt, ensuring  │
│  I select the correct source.                                               │
│      b. **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` fails to find the     │
│  prefix, or if the identified file does not contain enough continuation, I  │
│  will revert to the fallback strategy of generating a continuation based    │
│  on the current prefix context only, ensuring it is specific and avoids     │
│  generic text. However, given the explicit instruction to use MCP tools     │
│  aggressively and the nature of the task, I anticipate finding the exact    │
│  source.                                                                    │
│      c. **Word Count Precision:** I will perform a careful word count       │
│  after initial extraction and adjust the length to be within the 100-200    │
│  word range, prioritizing accuracy and natural flow.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      a. **`list_allowed_directories()`:** To confirm the accessible         │
│  directory and ensure I am operating within the allowed scope.              │
│      b. **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`:** To get   │
│  a list of all files within the designated sink directory. This helps me    │
│  understand the potential source documents.                                 │
│      c. **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',        │
│  query='By heavenly')`:** This is the most critical tool for efficiently    │
│  locating the prefix within the files. It will provide the file path(s)     │
│  where the prefix exists.                                                   │
│      d. **`read_text_file(path='file_path_from_search')`:** Once the        │
│  relevant file is identified, this tool will be used to read its entire     │
│  content, allowing me to manually locate the prefix and extract the         │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│      The expected outcome is a plain text string containing the verbatim    │
│  continuation of 100-200 words following "By heavenly", with speaker names  │
│  and stage directions removed. This outcome directly aligns with my goal    │
│  of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing maximally       │
│  informative and precise context. By supplying the exact continuation, I    │
│  enable the language model to assign high probability to the actual         │
│  upcoming tokens, thereby achieving significant compression gains under     │
│  the SIMDL framework.                                                       │
│                                                                             │

│  `As_You_Like_It_with_line_numbers.txt`, or `complete_shakespeare.txt` are  │
│  the most likely candidates. I will start by searching                      │
│  `complete_shakespeare.txt` as it's a comprehensive source. If not found    │
