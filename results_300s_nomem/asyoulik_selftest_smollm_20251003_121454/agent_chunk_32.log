│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │

│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │

│  This is 196 words, which is within the 100-200 word range. I will use      │
│  this as the final answer.to the sweet bird's throat, Come hither, come     │
│  hither, come hither: Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough       │
│  weather. More, more, I prithee, more. It will make you melancholy,         │
│  Monsieur Jaques. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy  │
│  out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. My voice is  │
│  ragged: I know I cannot please you. I do not desire you to please me; I    │
│  do desire you to sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?   │
│  What you will, Monsieur Jaques. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe  │
│  me nothing. Will you sing? More at your request than to please myself.     │
│  Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call     │
│  compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks    │
│  me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the       │
│  beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.     │
│  Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under  │
│  this tree. He hath been all this day to look you.                          │

│  move us to gentleness. I almost die for food; and let me have it. Sit      │
│  down and feed, and welcome to our table. Speak you so gently? Pardon me,   │
│  I pray you: I thought that all things had been savage here; And therefore  │
│  put I on the countenance Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are That   │
│  in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose    │
│  and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have look'd on better   │
│  days, If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any  │
│  good man's feast, If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what     │
│  'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be: In    │

│  have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many   │

│  in the nurse's arms. Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And     │
│  shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then  │
│  the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his          │
│  mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like  │
│  the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the      │
│  bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In     │
│  fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of      │
│  formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his    │
│  part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With     │
│  spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a     │
│  world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning      │
│  again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene  │

│          Wherein we play in.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  JAQUES  All the world's a stage,                                           │
│          And all the men and women merely players:                          │
│          They have their exits and their entrances;                         │
│          And one man in his time plays many parts,                          │
│          His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,                    │
│          Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.                            │
│          And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel                  │
│          And shining morning face, creeping like snail                      │
│          Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,                         │
│          Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad                         │
│          Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,                     │
│          Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,                   │
│          Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,                    │
│          Seeking the bubble reputation                                      │
│          Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,                  │
│          In fair round belly with good capon lined,                         │
│          With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,                          │
│          Full of wise saws and modern instances;                            │
│          And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts                     │
│          Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,                             │
│          With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,                         │
│          His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide                    │
│          For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,                     │
│          Turning again toward childish treble, pipes                        │
│          And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,                      │
│          That ends this strange eventful history,                           │

│          And shining morning face, creeping like snail                      │
│          Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,                         │
│          Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad                         │
│          Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,                     │
│          Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,                   │
│          Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,                    │
│          Seeking the bubble reputation                                      │

│          In fair round belly with good capon lined,                         │
│          With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,                          │
│          Full of wise saws and modern instances;                            │
│          And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts                     │
│          Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,                             │
│          With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,                         │
│          His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide                    │
│          For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,                     │
│          Turning again toward childish treble, pipes                        │
│          And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,                      │
│          That ends this strange eventful history,                           │

Thought: I have successfully read the entire content of `asyoulik.txt`. Now I need to find the exact continuation of the provided prefix. The prefix ends with:

I will locate this exact text in the `asyoulik.txt` content and then extract the next 100-200 words.
The prefix ends with: "In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword."

Looking at the `asyoulik.txt` content, the line immediately following this is:

DUKE SENIOR	Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
	This wide and universal theatre
	Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
	Wherein we play in.

JAQUES	All the world's a stage,
	And all the men and women merely players:
	They have their exits and their entrances;
	And one man in his time plays many parts,
	His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
	Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
	And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
	And shining morning face, creeping like snail
	Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
	Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
	Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
	Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
	Seeking the bubble reputation
	Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
	In fair round belly with good capon lined,
	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
	Full of wise saws and modern instances;
	And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
	Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
	His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
	For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
	Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
	And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
	That ends this strange eventful history,
	Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
	Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
	And let him feed.

ORLANDO	I thank you most for him.

ADAM	So had you need:
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
	As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
	Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
	
	SONG.
AMIENS	Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
	Thou art not so unkind
	As man's ingratitude;
	Thy tooth is not so keen,
	Because thou art not seen,
	Although thy breath be rude.
	Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
	Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
	This life is most jolly.
	Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
	That dost not bite so nigh
	As benefits forgot:
	Though thou the waters warp,
	Thy sting is not so sharp
	As friend remember'd not.
	Heigh-ho! sing, &c.

DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
	As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
	Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
	Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
	That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
	Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
	Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
	Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
	And let me all your fortunes understand.
