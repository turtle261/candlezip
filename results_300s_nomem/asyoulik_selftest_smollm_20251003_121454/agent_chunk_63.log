│  From a SIMDL perspective, this means identifying the most probable         │
│  sequence of tokens that follow the prefix, thereby minimizing the          │
│  description length of the subsequent text. Accessing external information  │
│  (entropy sinks) is crucial for this, as it allows for precise,             │
│  low-entropy predictions. The "cost" of accessing these sinks is the tool   │
│  usage.\n\n2. Key Steps:\n    *   Identify the source of the text prefix.   │
│  The text appears to be from a play, specifically Shakespeare\'s "As You    │
│  Like It," given the character names and the style.\n    *   Use the        │
│  available tools to search for the full text of "As You Like It" within     │
│  the allowed directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    *   Once the    │

│  document: The primary challenge is locating the specific play within the   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I will use file search tools.\n  │

│  overview of the directory structure and potential file names. This will    │
│  help in identifying likely candidates for the play\'s text.\n    *         │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'As    │
│  You Like It\')`: This is the most direct way to find files containing the  │
│  play\'s title. If this fails, I will use a distinctive phrase from the     │
│  prefix.\n    *   `read_text_file(path=\'...\')`: Once a potential file is  │
│  identified, I will read its content to verify it\'s the correct play and   │
│  then locate the prefix.\n\n    Detailed Tool Execution Plan:\n    *        │
│  First, I will use `directory_tree` to see what files are in the            │

│  `search_files_content` with the query "As You Like It" to pinpoint the     │
│  exact file.\n    *   Once the file is identified, I will use               │
│  `read_text_file` to get the full content.\n    *   I will then             │
│  programmatically find the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200        │
│  words, carefully omitting speaker names and stage directions.\n\n5.        │
│  Expected Outcome:\n    *   A plain text continuation of 100-200 words,     │
│  verbatim from the source document, following the provided prefix.\n    *   │
│  The output will be free of markdown, analysis, commentary, formatting,     │

│  "My errand is to you, fair youth; My gentle Phebe bid me give you this: I  │
│  know not the contents; but, as I guess By the stern brow and waspish       │
│  action Which she did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry       │
│  tenor: pardon me: I am but as a guiltless messenger. Patience herself      │
│  would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:  │
│  She says I am not fair, that I lack manners; She calls me proud, and that  │
│  she could not love me, Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will! Her     │
│  love is not the hare that I do hunt: Why writes she so to me? Well,        │
│  shepherd, well, This is a letter of your own device. No, I protest, I      │
│  know not the contents: Phebe did write it. Come, come, you are a fool And  │
│  turn'd into the extremity of love. I saw her hand: she has a leathern      │
│  hand. A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think That her old gloves    │
│  were on, but 'twas her hands: She has a huswife's hand; but that's no      │
│  matter: I say she never did invent this letter; This is a man's invention  │
│  and his hand. Sure, it is hers. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.  │
│  A style for-challengers; why, she defies me, Like Turk to Christian:       │
│  women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention Such   │
│  Ethiope words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance. Will     │
│  you hear the letter? So please you, for I never heard it yet; Yet heard    │

│  This is 200 words. I will use this as the continuation.My errand is to     │
│  you, fair youth; My gentle Phebe bid me give you this: I know not the      │
│  contents; but, as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she   │
│  did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor: pardon me: I    │
│  am but as a guiltless messenger. Patience herself would startle at this    │
│  letter And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all: She says I am not      │
│  fair, that I lack manners; She calls me proud, and that she could not      │
│  love me, Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will! Her love is not the   │
│  hare that I do hunt: Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well, This   │
│  is a letter of your own device. No, I protest, I know not the contents:    │
│  Phebe did write it. Come, come, you are a fool And turn'd into the         │
│  extremity of love. I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand. A              │
│  freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think That her old gloves were on,   │
│  but 'twas her hands: She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter: I     │
│  say she never did invent this letter; This is a man's invention            │
│                                                                             │

│  s heart hath burn'd? Can a woman rail thus? Call you this railing? Why,    │
│  thy godhead laid apart, Warr'st thou with a woman's heart? Did you ever    │
│  hear such railing? Whiles the eye of man did woo me, That could do no      │
│  vengeance to me. Meaning me a beast. If the scorn of your bright eyne      │
│  Have power to raise such love in mine, Alack, in me what strange effect    │
│  Would they work in mild aspect! Whiles you chid me, I did love; How then   │
│  might your prayers move! He that brings this love to thee Little knows     │
│  this love in me: And by him seal up thy mind; Whether that thy youth and   │
│  kind Will the faithful offer take Of me and all that I can make; Or else   │

│          A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,                        │
│          Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck                           │
│          A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,                      │

│          And with indented glides did slip away                             │
│          Into a bush: under which bush's shade                              │
│          A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,                              │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective): The task is to find the exact  │
│  continuation of a given text prefix from a play. From a SIMDL              │
│  perspective, this means identifying the most probable sequence of tokens   │
│  that follow the prefix, thereby minimizing the description length of the   │
│  subsequent text. Accessing external information (entropy sinks) is         │
│  crucial for this, as it allows for precise, low-entropy predictions. The   │
│  "cost" of accessing these sinks is the tool usage.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      *   Identify the source of the text prefix. The text appears to be     │
│  from a play, specifically Shakespeare's "As You Like It," given the        │
│  character names and the style.                                             │
│      *   Use the available tools to search for the full text of "As You     │
│  Like It" within the allowed directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.      │
│      *   Once the source document is found, locate the provided prefix      │
│  within it.                                                                 │
│      *   Extract the immediate continuation (100-200 words) verbatim,       │
│  removing speaker names and stage directions as per the previous chunk's    │
│  instruction.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Challenges and Approach:                                                │
│      *   Finding the document: The primary challenge is locating the        │
│  specific play within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I will  │
│  use file search tools.                                                     │
│      *   Exact Match: Ensuring an exact match of the prefix is crucial for  │
│  verbatim extraction.                                                       │
│      *   Word Count: Accurately counting 100-200 words while excluding      │
│  speaker names and stage directions.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      *   `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an   │
│  overview of the directory structure and potential file names. This will    │
│  help in identifying likely candidates for the play's text.                 │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='As You Like It')`: This is the most direct way to find files        │
│  containing the play's title. If this fails, I will use a distinctive       │
│  phrase from the prefix.                                                    │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='...')`: Once a potential file is             │
│  identified, I will read its content to verify it's the correct play and    │
│  then locate the prefix.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│      Detailed Tool Execution Plan:                                          │
│      *   First, I will use `directory_tree` to see what files are in the    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.                                  │
│      *   Then, I will use `search_files_content` with the query "As You     │
│  Like It" to pinpoint the exact file.                                       │
│      *   Once the file is identified, I will use `read_text_file` to get    │
│  the full content.                                                          │
│      *   I will then programmatically find the prefix and extract the       │
│  subsequent 100-200 words, carefully omitting speaker names and stage       │
│  directions.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome:                                                       │
│      *   A plain text continuation of 100-200 words, verbatim from the      │
│  source document, following the provided prefix.                            │
│      *   The output will be free of markdown, analysis, commentary,         │
│  formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                                 │
│      *   This aligns with my goal of minimizing future token prediction     │
│  entropy by providing precise, context-rich information.                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │

│  Call you this chiding? Alas, poor shepherd! Do you pity him? no, he        │
│  deserves no pity. Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an       │
│  instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to be endured! Well, go   │
│  your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this  │
│  to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,   │
│  I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true        │
│  lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company. Good morrow,    │
│  fair ones: pray you, if you know, Where in the purlieus of this forest     │
│  stands A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees? West of this place,     │
│  down in the neighbour bottom: The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream   │
│  Left on your right hand brings you to the place. But at this hour the      │
│  house doth keep itself; There's none within. If that an eye may profit by  │
│  a tongue, Then should I know you by description; Such garments and such    │
│  years: 'The boy is fair, Of female favour, and bestows himself Like a      │
│  ripe sister: the woman low And browner than her brother.' Are not you The  │
│  owner of the house I did inquire for? It is no boast, being ask'd, to say  │
│  we are. Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls   │
│  his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he? I am: what must we   │
│  understand by this? Some of my shame; if you will know of me What man I    │
│  am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was stain'd. I pray you,  │
│  tell it. When last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to  │
│  return again Within an hour, and pacing through the forest, Chewing the    │
│  food of sweet and bitter fancy, Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,   │
│  And mark what object did present itself: Under an oak, whose boughs were   │
│  moss'd with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched ragged    │
│  man, o'ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck A       │
│  green and gilded snake had wreathed itself, Who with her head nimble in    │
│  threats approach'd The opening of his mouth; but suddenly, Seeing          │
│  Orlando, it unlink'd itself, And with indented glides did slip away Into   │
│  a bush: under which bush's shade A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,     │
│  Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch, When that the sleeping   │
│  man should stir; for 'tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on   │
│  nothing that doth seem as dead: This seen, Orlando did approach the man    │
│  And found it was his brother, his elder brother.                           │

│  your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this  │
│  to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,   │
│  I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true        │
│  lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company. Good morrow,    │
│  fair ones: pray you, if you know, Where in the purlieus of this forest     │
│  stands A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees? West of this place,     │
│  down in the neighbour bottom: The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream   │
│  Left on your right hand brings you to the place. But at this hour the      │
│  house doth keep itself; There's none within. If that an eye may profit by  │
│  a tongue, Then should I know you by description; Such garments and such    │
│  years: 'The boy is fair, Of female favour, and bestows himself Like a      │
│  ripe sister: the woman low And browner than her brother.' Are not you The  │
│  owner of the house I did inquire for? It is no boast, being ask'd, to say  │
│  we are. Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls   │
│  his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he? I am: what must we   │
│  understand by this? Some of my shame; if you will know of me What man I    │
│  am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was stain'd. I pray you,  │

│  "Call you this chiding? Alas, poor shepherd! Do you pity him? no, he       │
│  deserves no pity. Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an       │
│  instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to be endured! Well, go   │
│  your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this  │
│  to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,   │
│  I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true        │
│  lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company. Good morrow,    │
│  fair ones: pray you, if you know, Where in the purlieus of this forest     │
│  stands A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees? West of this place,     │
│  down in the neighbour bottom: The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream   │
│  Left on your right hand brings you to the place. But at this hour the      │
│  house doth keep itself; There's none within. If that an eye may profit by  │
│  a tongue, Then should I know you by description; Such garments and such    │
│  years: 'The boy is fair, Of female favour, and bestows himself Like a      │
│  ripe sister: the woman low And browner than her brother.' Are not you The  │
│  owner of the house I did inquire for? It is no boast, being ask'd, to say  │
│  we are. Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls   │
│  his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he? I am: what must we   │
│  understand by this? Some of my shame; if you will know of me What man I    │
│  am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was stain'd. I pray you,  │
│  tell it. When last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to  │
│  return again Within an hour, and pacing through the forest, Chewing the    │
│  food of sweet and bitter fancy, Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,   │
│  And mark what object did present itself: Under an oak, whose boughs were   │
│  moss'd with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched ragged    │
│  man, o'ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck A       │
│  green and gilded snake had wreathed itself, Who with her head nimble in    │
│  threats approach'd The opening of his mouth; but suddenly, Seeing          │
│  Orlando, it unlink'd itself, And with indented glides did slip away Into   │

Thought: I have successfully read the entire content of `asyoulik.txt`. Now I need to find the exact prefix in the text and extract the next 100-200 words, removing speaker names and stage directions.

The prefix is:
"s heart hath burn'd? Can a woman rail thus? Call you this railing? Why, thy godhead laid apart, Warr'st thou with a woman's heart? Did you ever hear such railing? Whiles the eye of man did woo me, That could do no vengeance to me. Meaning me a beast. If the scorn of your bright eyne Have power to raise such love in mine, Alack, in me what strange effect Would they work in mild aspect! Whiles you chid me, I did love; How then might your prayers move! He that brings this love to thee Little knows this love in me: And by him seal up thy mind; Whether that thy youth and kind Will the faithful offer take Of me and all that I can make; Or else by him my love deny, And then I'll study how to die."

I will search for this string in the full text.
The text after the prefix is:

The cleaned text is 462 words long. I need to extract 100-200 words. I will take the first 200 words.

"Call you this chiding? Alas, poor shepherd! Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company. Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know, Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees? West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom: The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream Left on your right hand brings you to the place. But at this hour the house doth keep itself; There's none within. If that an eye may profit by a tongue, Then should I know you by description; Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair, Of female favour, and bestows himself Like a ripe sister: the woman low And browner than her brother.' Are not you The owner of the house I did inquire for? It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are. Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he? I am: what must we understand by this? Some of my shame; if you will know of me What man I am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was stain'd. I pray you, tell it. When last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to return again Within an hour, and pacing through the forest, Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside, And mark what object did present itself: Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself, Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd The opening of his mouth; but suddenly, Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself, And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush: under which bush's shade A lioness, with udders all drawn dry, Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch, When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead: This seen, Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother, his elder brother."

This is 462 words. I need to cut it down to 100-200 words.

Let's re-extract the first 200 words from the cleaned text.

"Call you this chiding? Alas, poor shepherd! Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love such a woman?

This is still the full text. I need to manually count and cut.
