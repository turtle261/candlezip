│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task:** The primary goal is to    │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing a maximally          │
│  informative context. This means finding the exact, immediate continuation  │
│  (100-200 words) of the provided text prefix. The text is identified as     │
│  being from Shakespeare\'s "As You Like It". I must use the available MCP   │
│  tools aggressively and am restricted to the                                │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. If tools fail, I must generate   │
│  a context-specific continuation.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    a. **Directory  │
│  Exploration:** List the contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`     │
│  directory to identify potential source files.\n    b. **File               │
│  Identification:** Look for files likely to contain the text of "As You     │
│  Like It".\n    c. **Content Search:** Search within identified files for   │
│  a unique segment of the provided prefix to locate the exact position.\n    │
│  d. **Extraction:** Read the file from the identified position and extract  │
│  the next 100-200 words.\n    e. **Formatting:** Ensure the extracted text  │
│  is plain text only, without any additional formatting or                   │
│  commentary.\n\n3. **Challenges and Mitigation:**\n    a. **Source          │
│  Document Absence:** If "As You Like It" is not found within the            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, I will revert to generating a    │
│  continuation based on the provided prefix, adhering to the "If ALL tools   │
│  fail" instructions.\n    b. **Text Variations:** Minor differences in      │
│  punctuation, capitalization, or line breaks in the source file compared    │
│  to the prefix will be handled by using a robust and unique search query    │
│  (e.g., a phrase that is less likely to be affected by minor formatting     │
│  changes).\n    c. **Word Count Precision:** I will extract a slightly      │
│  larger block of text and then carefully trim it to be within the 100-200   │
│  word range.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    a.                        │
│  **`list_allowed_directories()`:** To confirm the accessible path.\n    b.  │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`:** To get an     │
│  initial overview of files in the target directory. If subdirectories are   │
│  present, I will use                                                        │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`.\n    c.           │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'doth my simple feature content you?\')`:** This specific query is  │
│  chosen because it\'s a distinct phrase from the prefix, less likely to be  │
│  affected by common formatting variations, and appears near the end of the  │
│  prefix, making it easier to locate the continuation.\n    d.               │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`:** Once the file is         │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read its entire content for          │
│  extraction.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string of 100-200     │
│  words, representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from  │
│  "As You Like It", directly contributing to entropy reduction by providing  │
│  precise future token predictions.', 'ready': True}                         │

│  ROSALIND        Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the         │
│          contract of her marriage and the day it is                         │
│          solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,                     │
│          Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of                 │
│          seven year.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Who ambles Time withal?                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that         │
│          hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because               │
│          he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because               │
│          he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean               │
│          and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden                 │
│          of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Who doth he gallop withal?                                         │

│  ROSALIND        With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as           │
│          softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.         │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Who stays it still withal?                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between       │
│          term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.           │
│                                                                             │

│  ROSALIND        With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the              │
│          skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.                │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Are you native of this place?                                      │

│  ROSALIND        As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.       │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could                      │
│          purchase in so removed a dwelling.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        I have been told so of many: but indeed an old             │
│          religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was                │
│          in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship                │
│          too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard                  │
│          him read many lectures against it, and I thank God                 │
│          I am not a woman, to be touched with so many                       │
│          giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their                    │
│          whole sex withal.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he                │
│          laid to the charge of women?                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        There were none principal; they were all like one          │
│          another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming                 │
│          monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I prithee, recount some of them.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that       │
│          are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that                   │
│          abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on                 │
│          their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies                 │
│          on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of                   │
│          Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would                │
│          give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the               │
│          quotidian of love upon him.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me                 │
│          your remedy.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he             │
│          taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage                 │
│          of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO What were his marks?                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and           │
│          sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable                      │
│          spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,                     │
│          which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for                 │
│          simply your having in beard is a younger brother's                 │
│          revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your                 │
│          bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe                 │
│          untied and every thing about you demonstrating a                   │
│          careless desolation; but you are no such man; you                  │
│          are rather point-device in your accoutrements as                   │
│          loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.               │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.              │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you           │
│          love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to                 │
│          do than to confess she does: that is one of the                    │
│          points in the which women still give the lie to                    │
│          their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he                  │
│          that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind               │
│          is so admired?                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of                       │
│          Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?          │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves        │
│          as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and                  │
│          the reason why they are not so punished and cured                  │
│          is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers               │
│          are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.               │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so?                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  ROSALIND        Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me         │
│          his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to                 │
│          woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish                 │
│          youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing                  │
│          and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,                    │
│          inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every               │
│          passion something and for no passion truly any                     │
│          thing, as boys and women are for the most part                     │
│          cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe              │
│          him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep               │
│          for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor                  │
│          from his mad humour of love to a living humour of                  │
│          madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of                 │
│          the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.                  │
│          And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon                │
│          me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's                  │
│          heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.              │
│                                                                             │

│  ROSALIND        I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind        │
│          and come every day to my cote and woo me.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  ORLANDO Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me                      │

│          you shall tell me where in the forest you live.                    │
│          Will you go?                                                       │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task:** The primary goal is to minimize future token   │
│  prediction entropy by providing a maximally informative context. This      │
│  means finding the exact, immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the     │
│  provided text prefix. The text is identified as being from Shakespeare's   │
│  "As You Like It". I must use the available MCP tools aggressively and am   │
│  restricted to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. If tools       │
│  fail, I must generate a context-specific continuation.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Directory Exploration:** List the contents of the                 │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to identify potential source      │
│  files.                                                                     │
│      b. **File Identification:** Look for files likely to contain the text  │
│  of "As You Like It".                                                       │
│      c. **Content Search:** Search within identified files for a unique     │
│  segment of the provided prefix to locate the exact position.               │
│      d. **Extraction:** Read the file from the identified position and      │
│  extract the next 100-200 words.                                            │
│      e. **Formatting:** Ensure the extracted text is plain text only,       │
│  without any additional formatting or commentary.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Challenges and Mitigation:**                                          │
│      a. **Source Document Absence:** If "As You Like It" is not found       │
│  within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, I will revert to      │
│  generating a continuation based on the provided prefix, adhering to the    │
│  "If ALL tools fail" instructions.                                          │
│      b. **Text Variations:** Minor differences in punctuation,              │
│  capitalization, or line breaks in the source file compared to the prefix   │
│  will be handled by using a robust and unique search query (e.g., a phrase  │
│  that is less likely to be affected by minor formatting changes).           │
│      c. **Word Count Precision:** I will extract a slightly larger block    │
│  of text and then carefully trim it to be within the 100-200 word range.    │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      a. **`list_allowed_directories()`:** To confirm the accessible path.   │
│      b. **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`:** To get   │
│  an initial overview of files in the target directory. If subdirectories    │
│  are present, I will use                                                    │
│  `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`.                     │
│      c. **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',        │
│  query='doth my simple feature content you?')`:** This specific query is    │
│  chosen because it's a distinct phrase from the prefix, less likely to be   │
│  affected by common formatting variations, and appears near the end of the  │
│  prefix, making it easier to locate the continuation.                       │
│      d. **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`:** Once the file is    │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read its entire content for          │
│  extraction.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string of 100-200 words,             │
│  representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "As     │
│  You Like It", directly contributing to entropy reduction by providing      │
│  precise future token predictions.                                          │
│                                                                             │
