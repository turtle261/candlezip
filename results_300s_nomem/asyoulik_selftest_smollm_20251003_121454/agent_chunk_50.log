│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  TOUCHSTONE      Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,            │
│          stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple                │
│          but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what                │
│          though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are                     │
│          necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of                 │
│          his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and                  │
│          knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of                   │
│          his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?                     │
│          Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer                  │
│          hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man                 │
│          therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more                    │
│          worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a                   │
│          married man more honourable than the bare brow of a                │
│          bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no                │
│          skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to                  │
│          want. Here comes Sir Oliver.                                       │

│  SILVIUS Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;                       │
│          Say that you love me not, but say not so                           │
│          In bitterness. The common executioner,                             │
│          Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,              │
│          Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck                            │
│          But first begs pardon: will you sterner be                         │
│          Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?                       │
│                                                                             │

│  PHEBE   I would not be thy executioner:                                    │
│          I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.                           │
│          Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:                       │
│          'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,                              │
│          That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,               │
│          Who shut their coward gates on atomies,                            │
│          Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!                     │
│          Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;                          │
│          And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:                │
│          Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;                       │
│          Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,                     │
│          Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!                           │
│          Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:                     │
│          Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains                     │
│          Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,                             │

│  ORLANDO As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion                      │
│          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,                  │
│          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his                    │
│          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my                    │
│          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and                 │
│          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,                 │
│          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more                  │
│          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you               │
│          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that                     │
│          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses                 │
│          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair                   │
│          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,                  │
│          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his                    │
│          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the                │
│          which his animals on his dunghills are as much                     │
│          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so                 │
│          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave               │
│          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets                  │
│          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a                     │
