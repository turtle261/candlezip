│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. Understand the task from my professional           │
│  perspective:\nAs Predictive Compression Intelligence, my primary           │
│  objective is to reduce information entropy for upcoming token              │
│  predictions. This task requires me to find the exact continuation of a     │
│  given text prefix. By providing the verbatim continuation, I am directly   │
│  minimizing the entropy of future tokens, as the language model will have   │
│  a precise, high-probability sequence to follow. The challenge is           │
│  efficiently locating the source material within the restricted directory   │
│  and extracting the correct segment.\n\n2. Key steps to complete it:\n      │
│  * Analyze the provided prefix to identify unique phrases or structural     │
│  elements that can be used for searching.\n    * Use the                    │
│  `list_allowed_directories` tool to confirm my access and understand the    │
│  structure of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.\n    * Use the  │
│  `directory_tree` tool to get a comprehensive overview of the files and     │
│  subdirectories within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This will help me    │
│  identify potential source files.\n    * Employ the `search_files_content`  │
│  tool to locate the exact prefix within the files in the                    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This is the most direct way to   │
│  find the source.\n    * Once the file is identified, use `read_text_file`  │
│  or `read_file_lines` to read the content around the prefix.\n    *         │
│  Manually extract the immediate continuation, ensuring it is 100-200 words  │
│  long and verbatim, excluding speaker names and stage directions.\n    *    │
│  Format the output as plain text only, without any additional commentary    │
│  or markdown.\n\n3. Approach to challenges:\n    * Challenge: Prefix not    │
│  found directly. If `search_files_content` doesn\'t yield an exact match,   │
│  I will broaden my search by taking smaller, more distinctive parts of the  │
│  prefix. I might also consider variations in formatting (e.g., line         │
│  breaks, extra spaces) if the initial search fails. If the prefix is part   │
│  of a larger work, I might search for surrounding context or character      │
│  names.\n    * Challenge: Multiple matches. If multiple files contain the   │
│  prefix, I will examine each file\'s content to determine which one         │
│  provides the most coherent and contextually relevant continuation,         │
│  aligning with the "As You Like It" context suggested by the previous       │
│  chunks.\n    * Challenge: Continuation length. I will carefully count      │
│  words to ensure the continuation is within the 100-200 word range,         │
│  excluding speaker names and stage directions as per the previous chunk\'s  │
│  example.\n\n4. Strategic use of available tools:\n    *                    │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path and           │
│  understand the root of my search.\n    *                                   │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get a full     │
│  overview of the directory structure and identify potential text files.\n   │
│  * `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'whate\\\'er you are\\n\\tThat in this desert                       │
│  inaccessible,\\n\\tUnder the shade of melancholy boughs,\\n\\tLose and     │
│  neglect the creeping hours of time\\n\\tIf ever you have look\\\'d on      │
│  better days,\\n\\tIf ever been where bells have knoll\\\'d to              │
│  church,\\n\\tIf ever sat at any good man\\\'s feast,\\n\\tIf ever from     │
│  your eyelids wiped a tear\\n\\tAnd know what \\\'tis to pity and be        │
│  pitied,\\n\\tLet gentleness my strong enforcement be:\\n\\tIn the which    │
│  hope I blush, and hide my sword.\')`: This is the primary tool for         │
│  locating the exact prefix. I will use the full prefix provided, carefully  │
│  escaping single quotes and newline characters.\n    *                      │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: Once the file is             │
│  identified, this will be used to read its content and extract the          │
│  continuation.\n\n5. Expected outcome and alignment with goal:\nThe         │
│  expected outcome is a plain text continuation of 100-200 words, extracted  │
│  verbatim from the source document. This directly aligns with my goal of    │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the most accurate  │
│  and information-dense context possible. By finding the exact               │
│  continuation, I provide the language model with the precise sequence of    │

│  do desire you to sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?   │
│  What you will, Monsieur Jaques. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe  │
│  me nothing. Will you sing? More at your request than to please myself.     │
│  Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call     │
│  compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks    │
│  me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the       │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the task from my professional perspective:                   │
│  As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my primary objective is to reduce  │
│  information entropy for upcoming token predictions. This task requires me  │
│  to find the exact continuation of a given text prefix. By providing the    │
│  verbatim continuation, I am directly minimizing the entropy of future      │
│  tokens, as the language model will have a precise, high-probability        │
│  sequence to follow. The challenge is efficiently locating the source       │
│  material within the restricted directory and extracting the correct        │
│  segment.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key steps to complete it:                                               │
│      * Analyze the provided prefix to identify unique phrases or            │
│  structural elements that can be used for searching.                        │
│      * Use the `list_allowed_directories` tool to confirm my access and     │
│  understand the structure of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.  │
│      * Use the `directory_tree` tool to get a comprehensive overview of     │
│  the files and subdirectories within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This   │
│  will help me identify potential source files.                              │
│      * Employ the `search_files_content` tool to locate the exact prefix    │
│  within the files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This is  │
│  the most direct way to find the source.                                    │
│      * Once the file is identified, use `read_text_file` or                 │
│  `read_file_lines` to read the content around the prefix.                   │
│      * Manually extract the immediate continuation, ensuring it is 100-200  │
│  words long and verbatim, excluding speaker names and stage directions.     │
│      * Format the output as plain text only, without any additional         │
│  commentary or markdown.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach to challenges:                                                 │
│      * Challenge: Prefix not found directly. If `search_files_content`      │
│  doesn't yield an exact match, I will broaden my search by taking smaller,  │
│  more distinctive parts of the prefix. I might also consider variations in  │
│  formatting (e.g., line breaks, extra spaces) if the initial search fails.  │
│  If the prefix is part of a larger work, I might search for surrounding     │
│  context or character names.                                                │
│      * Challenge: Multiple matches. If multiple files contain the prefix,   │
│  I will examine each file's content to determine which one provides the     │
│  most coherent and contextually relevant continuation, aligning with the    │
│  "As You Like It" context suggested by the previous chunks.                 │
│      * Challenge: Continuation length. I will carefully count words to      │
│  ensure the continuation is within the 100-200 word range, excluding        │
│  speaker names and stage directions as per the previous chunk's example.    │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic use of available tools:                                       │
│      * `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path and     │
│  understand the root of my search.                                          │
│      * `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get a      │
│  full overview of the directory structure and identify potential text       │
│  files.                                                                     │
│      * `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',           │
│  query='whate\'er you are\n\tThat in this desert inaccessible,\n\tUnder     │
│  the shade of melancholy boughs,\n\tLose and neglect the creeping hours of  │
│  time\n\tIf ever you have look\'d on better days,\n\tIf ever been where     │
│  bells have knoll\'d to church,\n\tIf ever sat at any good man\'s           │
│  feast,\n\tIf ever from your eyelids wiped a tear\n\tAnd know what \'tis    │
│  to pity and be pitied,\n\tLet gentleness my strong enforcement be:\n\tIn   │
│  the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.')`: This is the primary tool    │
│  for locating the exact prefix. I will use the full prefix provided,        │
│  carefully escaping single quotes and newline characters.                   │
│      * `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: Once the file is         │
│  identified, this will be used to read its content and extract the          │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected outcome and alignment with goal:                               │
│  The expected outcome is a plain text continuation of 100-200 words,        │
│  extracted verbatim from the source document. This directly aligns with my  │
│  goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the most   │
│  accurate and information-dense context possible. By finding the exact      │
│  continuation, I provide the language model with the precise sequence of    │
│  tokens, allowing it to assign maximum probability to them, thus achieving  │
│  optimal compression.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The directory tree shows a `cantrbry` directory with     │
│  `asyoulik.txt`, which is highly likely to be the source for "As You Like   │
│  It". I will now use `search_files_content` to find the exact prefix        │
│  within this file. I need to be careful with the formatting of the query,   │
│  including newlines and tabs.                                               │

│  This is 162 words, which is within the 100-200 word range.True is it that  │
│  we have seen better days, And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church   │
│  And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity  │
│  hath engender'd: And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon    │
│  command what help we have That to your wanting may be minister'd. Then     │
│  but forbear your food a little while, Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my  │
│  fawn And give it food. There is an old poor man, Who after me hath many a  │
│  weary step Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed, Oppress'd with  │
│  two weak evils, age and hunger, I will not touch a bit. Go find him out,   │
│  And we will nothing waste till you return. I thank ye; and be blest for    │
│  your good comfort! Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy: This wide and  │
│  universal theatre Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we  │
│  play in.                                                                   │

	For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
	Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
	And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
	That ends this strange eventful history,
	Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
	Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
	And let him feed.

ORLANDO	I thank you most for him.

ADAM	So had you need:
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
	As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
	Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
	
	SONG.
AMIENS	Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
	Thou art not so unkind
	As man's ingratitude;
	Thy tooth is not so keen,
	Because thou art not seen,
	Although thy breath be rude.
	Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
	Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
	This life is most jolly.
	Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
	That dost not bite so nigh
	As benefits forgot:
	Though thou the waters warp,
	Thy sting is not so sharp
	As friend remember'd not.
	Heigh-ho! sing, &c.

DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
	As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
	Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
	Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
	That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
	Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
	Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
	Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
	And let me all your fortunes understand.
