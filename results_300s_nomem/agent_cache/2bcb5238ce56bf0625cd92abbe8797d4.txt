yet?' the Hatter said, turning to
Alice again.
`No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'
`I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.
`Nor I,' said the March Hare.
Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better
with the time,' she said, `than wasting it in asking riddles that
have no answers.'
`If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you
wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'
`I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
`Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
`Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to
beat time when I learn music.'
`Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand
beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do
almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose
it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:
you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'
