DUKE FREDERICK More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors; And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands: Do this expediently and at the uttermost. OLIVER Not any land of mine, my gracious lord, But I will render it to you; and, for this, I will be your true and loyal subject, So please you, give me leave to go with you. DUKE FREDERICK Away, and let me hear no more of thee. OLIVER I will, my lord, and thank you for your grace. DUKE FREDERICK Go, get you gone, and let me hear no more of you.
[Exit OLIVER]
DUKE FREDERICK Come, lords, we'll go and hunt the roe.
[Exeunt]
