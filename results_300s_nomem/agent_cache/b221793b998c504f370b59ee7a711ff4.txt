"	[Enter SILVIUS]"
Looking at the text I just read, the immediate continuation after "[Enter SILVIUS]" is:
"SILVIUS	My errand is to you, fair youth;
My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
I know not the contents; but, as I guess
By the stern brow and waspish action
Which she did use as she was writing of it,
It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
I am but as a guiltless messenger.
ROSALIND	Patience herself would startle at this letter
And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
This is a letter of your own device.
SILVIUS	No, I protest, I know not the contents:
Phebe did write it.
ROSALIND	Come, come, you are a fool
And turn'd into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
I say she never did invent this letter;
This is a man's invention and his hand.
SILVIUS	Sure, it is hers.
ROSALIND	Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
SILVIUS	So please you, for I never heard it yet;
Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
ROSALIND	She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
[Reads]
Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
Can a woman rail thus?
SILVIUS	Call you this railing?
ROSALIND	[Reads]
Why, thy godhead laid apart,
Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
Did you ever hear such railing?
Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
That could do no vengeance to me.
Meaning me a beast.
If the scorn of your bright eyne
Have power to raise such love in mine,
Alack, in me what strange effect
Would they work in mild aspect!
Whiles you chid me, I did love;
How then might your prayers move!
He that brings this love to thee
Little knows this love in me:
And by him seal up thy mind;
Whether that thy youth and kind
Will the faithful offer take
Of me and all that I can make;
Or else by him my love deny,
And then I'll study how to die."
I need to extract the next 100-200 words verbatim, removing speaker names and stage directions.
The text starts with "My errand is to you, fair youth; My gentle Phebe bid me give you this: I know not the contents; but, as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor: pardon me: I am but as a guiltless messenger.

I will extract the first 100-200 words from this continuation, removing speaker names and stage directions.

32. Which
33. she

42. It
43. bears
44. an

111. Why

114. so
115. to
116. me?
117. Well,
118. shepherd,
119. well,
120. This
121. is
122. a
123. letter
124. of

128. No,

158. has
159. a
160. leathern
161. hand.
162. A
163. freestone-colour'd

168. think
169. That
170. her
171. old
172. gloves
173. were
174. on,
175. but
176. 'twas
177. her
178. hands:
179. She
180. has
181. a
182. huswife's
183. hand;
184. but
185. that's
186. no
187. matter:
188. I
189. say
190. she
191. never
192. did
193. invent
194. this
195. letter;
196. This
197. is
198. a
199. man's
200. invention
This is 200 words. I will use this as the continuation.My errand is to you, fair youth; My gentle Phebe bid me give you this: I know not the contents; but, as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor: pardon me: I am but as a guiltless messenger.
