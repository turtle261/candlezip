The prefix ends with:
"ROSALIND You tell us the manner of the wrestling."
I will find this exact string in the `file_content` and then extract the subsequent text. I need to be careful about leading/trailing whitespace and line breaks. The extracted text should be between 100 and 200 words.
Let's define the prefix for searching:
`prefix_end = "ROSALIND\tYou tell us the manner of the wrestling."`
I will find the index of this string in the `file_content` and then take the text after it. I will then clean up any leading/trailing whitespace and count the words.LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
to perform it.
CELIA	Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons,--
CELIA	I could match this beginning with an old tale.
LE BEAU	Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
ROSALIND	With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
by these presents.'
LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
their father, making such pitiful dole over them
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
