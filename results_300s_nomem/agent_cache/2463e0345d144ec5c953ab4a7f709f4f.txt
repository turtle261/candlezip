The prefix ends with:
`and I had to sing`
`            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder`
I will search for this exact string in the `alice29.txt` content I just read.
The content I read contains:
`            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you're at!"`
So the immediate continuation is " what you're at!" followed by the next sentence.
Let me extract the text starting from " what you're at!" and aim for 100-200 words.
The relevant section from the `read_text_file` output is:
The prefix ends with:
`and I had to sing
"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder`
The immediate continuation is:
` what you're at!"
You know the song, perhaps?'
`I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
`It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--
"Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle--"'
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that
they had to pinch it to make it stop.
`Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,
`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the
time!  Off with his head!"'
`How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.
`And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,
`he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'
A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so
many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.
`Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always
tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'
`Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.
`Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'
`But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice
ventured to ask.
`Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,
yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady
tells us a story.'`
This continuation is well within the 100-200 word range and is verbatim. what you're at!"
