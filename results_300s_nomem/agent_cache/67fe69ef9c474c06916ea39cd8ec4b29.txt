this young man his son,I should have given him tears unto entreaties,Ere he should thus have ventured.CELIA Gentle cousin,Let us go thank him and encourage him:My father's rough and envious dispositionSticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:If you do keep your promises in loveBut justly, as you have exceeded all promise,Your mistress shall be happy.ROSALIND Gentleman,[Giving him a chain from her neck]Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.Shall we go, coz?CELIA Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.ORLANDO Can I not say, I thank you? My better partsAre all thrown down, and that which here stands upIs but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.ROSALIND He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrownMore than your enemies.CELIA Will you go, coz?ROSALIND Have with you. Fare you well.
