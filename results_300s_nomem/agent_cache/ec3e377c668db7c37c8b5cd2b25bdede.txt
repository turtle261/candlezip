nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical. I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in deed and word? is it a true thing? No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign. Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical? I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign. Would you not have me honest? No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar. A material fool! Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me honest. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
