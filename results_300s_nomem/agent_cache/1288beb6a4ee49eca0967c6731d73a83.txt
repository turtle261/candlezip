fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
ROSALIND	With his mouth full of news.
CELIA	Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
ROSALIND	Then shall we be news-crammed.
CELIA	All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
[Enter LE BEAU]
Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?
LE BEAU	Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
CELIA	Sport! of what colour?
LE BEAU	What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?
ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will.
TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decree.
CELIA	Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
TOUCHSTONE	Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
ROSALIND	Thou losest thy old smell.
LE BEAU	You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
ROSALIND	You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
