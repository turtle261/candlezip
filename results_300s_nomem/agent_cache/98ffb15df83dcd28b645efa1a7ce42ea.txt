I will manually locate the prefix in the provided text and then carefully extract the continuation.
The prefix ends with "Unt". The full line is "Unto the sweet bird's throat,".
Here's the relevant section from the file:
Now, I will extract the continuation, starting from "o the sweet bird's throat," and count the words, excluding speaker names and stage directions.

129. but
130. that
131. they

134. is
135. like
136. the
137. encounter
138. of
139. two
140. dog-apes,
141. and
142. when
143. a
144. man
145. thanks

148. methinks
149. I

181. the
182. duke
183. will
184. drink
185. under
186. this
187. tree.
188. He
189. hath
190. been
191. all
192. this
193. day
194. to
195. look
196. you.
This is 196 words, which is within the 100-200 word range. I will use this as the final answer.to the sweet bird's throat, Come hither, come hither, come hither: Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather. More, more, I prithee, more. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos? What you will, Monsieur Jaques. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing. Will you sing? More at your request than to please myself. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look you.
