The previous `search_files_content` action failed because the query was too long and likely contained formatting differences (e.g., extra newlines or spaces) that prevented an exact match. I should have used a shorter, more robust query.
However, I have now read the entire `alice29.txt` file. I can manually locate the prefix within the file content and extract the continuation.
The prefix ends with:
`Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: ` `
Looking at the full content of `alice29.txt`, the exact continuation is:
`besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'`
I will now extract the next 100-200 words from this point.

The continuation in the file is:
`besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'
`It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
`Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.
`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling
voice.
`There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has
just been picked up.'
`What's in it?' said the Queen.
`I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems
to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
`It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was
written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
`Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
`It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,
there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper
as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set
of verses.'`
This is approximately 190 words, which fits the requirement.
