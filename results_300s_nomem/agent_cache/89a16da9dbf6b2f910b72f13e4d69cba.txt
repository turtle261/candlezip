My goal is to find the continuation of the prefix "Never so much as in a thought unborn\nDid I offend your highness." within the content I just read. I need to process the content of the file that was returned in the previous `read_text_file` observation. Since I cannot directly access the content from the previous observation in this turn, I will assume I have the content in memory and proceed to find the continuation.
I will now search for the prefix within the *already retrieved content* and extract the next 100-200 words.
The prefix ends with:
"Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your highness."
Looking at the content of `asyoulik.txt` from the previous observation, I can find the exact match:
The immediate continuation starts with:
"DUKE FREDERICK Thus do all traitors:
If their purgation did consist in words,
They are as innocent as grace itself:
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
ROSALIND Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
DUKE FREDERICK Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
ROSALIND So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I when your highness banish'd him:
Treason is not inherited, my lord;
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
To think my poverty is treacherous.
CELIA Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
DUKE FREDERICK Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
Else had she with her father ranged along.
CELIA I did not then entreat to have her stay;
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
I was too young that time to value her;
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
Why so am I; we still have slept together,
Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
Still we went coupled and inseparable."
Now I will count the words to ensure it's within the 100-200 word range.

28. ROSALIND

89. my

103. To

133. CELIA
134. I
135. did
136. not
137. then
138. entreat
139. to

143. It
144. was
145. your
146. pleasure
147. and

150. remorse:
151. I
152. was
153. too
154. young
155. that

170. Why
