Why, what a medicine were this to find out this fellow! Pale as a oyster. And what else? A beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover. Fair youth, I would you knew me. I should do my duty and curtsy before you, but, by my troth, I care not for you.
