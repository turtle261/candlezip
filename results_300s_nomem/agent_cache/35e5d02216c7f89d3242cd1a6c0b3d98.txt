The current document prefix ends with:
"ROSALIND	I care not if I have: it is my study
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:"
I will look for this exact phrase in the provided prior memory and then extract the subsequent text.
The prior memory contains the full text of the play. I will search for the last line of the prefix in the prior memory and then extract the continuation.
The last line of the prefix is: "To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:"
Let's find this in the prior memory and get the next 100-200 words.
From the prior memory:
"ROSALIND	I care not if I have: it is my study
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
PHEBE	Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
SILVIUS	It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND	And I for no woman.
SILVIUS	It is to be all made of faith and service;
And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND	And I for no woman.
SILVIUS	It is to be all made of fantasy,
All made of passion and all made of wishes,
All adoration, duty, and observance,
All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
All purity, all trial, all observance;
And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE	And so am I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO	And so am I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND	And so am I for no woman.
PHEBE	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
SILVIUS	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ORLANDO	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ROSALIND	Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
ORLANDO	To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
ROSALIND	Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling
of Irish wolves against the moon.
[To SILVIUS]
I will help you, if I can:
[To PHEBE]
I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.
[To PHEBE]
I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be
married to-morrow:
[To ORLANDO]
I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
shall be married to-morrow:
[To SILVIUS]
I will content you, if what pleases you contents
you, and you shall be married to-morrow.
[To ORLANDO]
As you love Rosalind, meet:
[To SILVIUS]
as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,
I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.
SILVIUS	I'll not fail, if I live.
PHEBE	Nor I.
ORLANDO	Nor I.
[Exeunt]"
The continuation starts after "To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:".
Let's extract the next 100-200 words.

Word count: 300 words. This is more than 200 words. I need to trim it to be between 100-200 words.
Let's try to get around 150 words.
