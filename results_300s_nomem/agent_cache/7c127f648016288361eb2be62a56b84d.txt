I will manually locate the prefix in the provided text and then carefully extract the continuation.
The prefix ends with "By heavenly".
Here's the relevant section from the file:
Now, I will extract the continuation, starting from "synod was devised," and count the words, excluding speaker names and stage directions.
1.  synod
2.  was
3.  devised,
4.  Of
5.  many
6.  faces,
7.  eyes
8.  and
9.  hearts,
10. To
11. have
12. the
13. touches
14. dearest
15. prized.
16. Heaven
17. would
18. that
19. she
20. these
21. gifts
22. should
23. have,
24. And
25. I
26. to
27. live
28. and
29. die
30. her
31. slave.
32. O
33. most
34. gentle
35. pulpiter!
36. what
37. tedious
38. homily
39. of
40. love
41. have
42. you
43. wearied
44. your
45. parishioners
46. withal,
47. and
48. never
49. cried
50. 'Have
51. patience,
52. good
53. people!'
54. How
55. now!
56. back,
57. friends!
58. Shepherd,
59. go
60. off
61. a
62. little.
63. Go
64. with
65. him,
66. sirrah.
67. Come,
68. shepherd,
69. let
70. us
71. make
72. an
73. honourable
74. retreat;
75. though
76. not
77. with
78. bag
79. and
80. baggage,
81. yet
82. with
83. scrip
84. and
85. scrippage.
86. Didst
87. thou
88. hear
89. these
90. verses?
91. O,
92. yes,
93. I
94. heard
95. them
96. all,
97. and
98. more
99. too;
100. for
101. some
102. of
103. them
104. had
105. in
106. them
107. more
108. feet
109. than
110. the
111. verses
112. would
113. bear.
114. That's
115. no
116. matter:
117. the
118. feet
119. might
120. bear
121. the
122. verses.
123. Ay,
124. but
125. the
126. feet
127. were
128. lame
129. and
130. could
131. not
132. bear
133. themselves
134. without
135. the
136. verse
137. and
138. therefore
139. stood
140. lamely
141. in
142. the
143. verse.
144. But
145. didst
146. thou
147. hear
148. without
149. wondering
150. how
151. thy
152. name
153. should
154. be
155. hanged
156. and
157. carved
158. upon
159. these
160. trees?
161. I
162. was
163. seven
164. of
165. the
166. nine
167. days
168. out
169. of
170. the
171. wonder
172. before
173. you
174. came;
175. for
176. look
177. here
178. what
179. I
180. found
181. on
182. a
183. palm-tree.
184. I
185. was
186. never
187. so
188. be-rhymed
189. since
190. Pythagoras'
191. time,
192. that
193. I
194. was
195. an
196. Irish
197. rat,
198. which
199. I
200. can
201. hardly
202. remember.
This is 202 words, which is slightly over the 100-200 word range. I will trim it to be within the range, aiming for around 190 words.
Let's re-count and stop at around 190 words.
1.  synod
2.  was
3.  devised,
4.  Of
5.  many
6.  faces,
7.  eyes
8.  and
9.  hearts,
10. To
11. have
12. the
13. touches
14. dearest
15. prized.
16. Heaven
17. would
18. that
19. she
20. these
21. gifts
22. should
23. have,
24. And
25. I
26. to
27. live
28. and
29. die
30. her
31. slave.
32. ROSALIND
33. O
34. most
35. gentle
36. pulpiter!
37. what
38. tedious
39. homily
40. of
41. love
42. have
43. you
44. wearied
45. your
46. parishioners
47. withal,
48. and
49. never
50. cried
51. 'Have
52. patience,
53. good
54. people!'
55. CELIA
56. How
57. now!
58. back,
59. friends!
60. Shepherd,
61. go
62. off
63. a
64. little.
65. Go
66. with
67. him,
68. sirrah.
69. TOUCHSTONE
70. Come,
71. shepherd,
72. let
73. us
74. make
75. an
76. honourable
77. retreat;
78. though
79. not
80. with
81. bag
82. and
83. baggage,
84. yet
85. with
86. scrip
87. and
88. scrippage.
89. CELIA
90. Didst
91. thou
92. hear
93. these
94. verses?
95. ROSALIND
96. O,
97. yes,
98. I
99. heard
100. them
101. all,
102. and
103. more
104. too;
105. for
106. some
107. of
108. them
109. had
110. in
111. them
112. more
113. feet
114. than
115. the
116. verses
117. would
118. bear.
119. CELIA
120. That's
121. no
122. matter:
123. the
124. feet
125. might
126. bear
127. the
128. verses.
129. ROSALIND
130. Ay,
131. but
132. the
133. feet
134. were
135. lame
136. and
137. could
138. not
139. bear
140. themselves
141. without
142. the
143. verse
144. and
145. therefore
146. stood
147. lamely
148. in
149. the
150. verse.
151. CELIA
152. But
153. didst
154. thou
155. hear
156. without
157. wondering
158. how
159. thy
160. name
161. should
162. be
163. hanged
164. and
165. carved
166. upon
167. these
168. trees?
169. ROSALIND
170. I
171. was
172. seven
173. of
174. the
175. nine
176. days
177. out
178. of
179. the
180. wonder
181. before
182. you
183. came;
184. for
185. look
186. here
187. what
188. I
189. found
190. on
191. a
192. palm-tree.
I will remove the speaker names and stage directions for the final output.
The continuation will be:
"synod was devised, Of many faces, eyes and hearts, To have the touches dearest prized. Heaven would that she these gifts should have, And I to live and die her slave. O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have patience, good people!' How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little. Go with him, sirrah. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat; though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage. Didst thou hear these verses? O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear. That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses. Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse.

This is 191 words. This is within the 100-200 word range.synod was devised, Of many faces, eyes and hearts, To have the touches dearest prized.
