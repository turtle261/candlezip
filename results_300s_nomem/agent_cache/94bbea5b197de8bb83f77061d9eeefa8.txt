The prefix ends with:
"CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
S"
Searching for "S" after "Into a thousand that I have forgotten." in the text:
"CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
SILVIUS	O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!
If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
That ever love did make thee run into,
Thou hast not loved:
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
Thou hast not loved:
Or if thou hast not broke from company
Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
Thou hast not loved.
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!
[Exit]
ROSALIND	Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
I have by hard adventure found mine own.
TOUCHSTONE	And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took
two cods and, giving her them again, said with
weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
ROSALIND	Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
TOUCHSTONE	Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I
break my shins against it.
ROSALIND	Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
Is much upon my fashion.
TOUCHSTONE	And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
CELIA	I pray you, one of you question yond man
If he for gold will give us any food:
I faint almost to death.
TOUCHSTONE	Holla, you clown!
ROSALIND	Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.
CORIN	Who calls?
TOUCHSTONE	Your betters, sir.
CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched.
ROSALIND	Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
CORIN	And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
ROSALIND	I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
And faints for succor.
CORIN	Fair sir, I pity her
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
But I am shepherd to another man
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
My master is of churlish disposition
And little recks to find the way to heaven
By doing deeds of hospitality:
Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
By reason of his absence, there is nothing
That you will feed on; but what is, come see.
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
That little cares for buying any thing.
ROSALIND	I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
CELIA	And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
And willingly could waste my time in it.
CORIN	Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
Go with me: if you like upon report
The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
I will your very faithful feeder be
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
[Exeunt]"

I need to extract 100-200 words. I will start from "ILVIUS O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!" and count. I will exclude speaker names and stage directions.

112. a-night
113. to

117. I
118. remember
119. the

124. and
125. the
126. cow's

129. her
130. pretty
131. chopt
132. hands

143. instead
144. of
145. her,
146. from

148. I

170. lovers
171. run
172. into

175. but
176. as
177. all
178. is
179. mortal
180. in
181. nature,
182. so
183. is
184. all
185. nature
186. in
187. love
188. mortal
189. in
190. folly.
191. Thou
192. speakest
193. wiser
194. than
195. thou
196. art
197. ware
198. of.
199. Nay,
200. I
201. shall
202. ne'er
203. be
204. ware
205. of
206. mine
207. own
208. wit
209. till
210. I
211. break
212. my
213. shins
214. against
215. it.
This is 215 words, which is slightly over the 200-word limit. I will trim it to be within the 100-200 word range. I will stop at "mortal in folly." which is word 190.
The continuation will be:
