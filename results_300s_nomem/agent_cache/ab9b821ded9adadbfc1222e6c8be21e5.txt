were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
yet was not the knight forsworn.
Let's reconstruct the full sentence and then count the words.
The prefix ends with: "Nature's; who perceiv"
The continuation starts with: "eth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now, wit! whither wander you?
TOUCHSTONE Mistress, you must come away to your father.
CELIA Were you made the messenger?
TOUCHSTONE No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
ROSALIND Where learned you that oath, fool?
TOUCHSTONE Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn."
Now, I will count the words from "eth our natural wits too dull" to ensure it's within the 100-200 word range.

67. ROSALIND

79. that
80. swore

88. and
89. swore
90. by
91. his

95. was
96. naught:
97. now
98. I'll
99. stand
100. to
101. it,
102. the
103. pancakes
104. were

111. and
112. yet
113. was
114. not
115. the
116. knight

The word count is 117 words, which is within the 100-200 word range. I will now provide the plain text continuation.eth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now, wit! whither wander you?
