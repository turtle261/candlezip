people, who best know him, that I am altogether
misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but that
I kindle the boy with the old and humorous
knights, and after some remove, to try if you can
bring him to the new court.
Let's count the words from the observation:
"day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and so God keep your worship! Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why, hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised: but it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy with the old and humorous knights, and after some remove, to try if you can bring him to the new court."
Counting the words:
day (1) living (2). I (3) speak (4) but (5) brotherly (6) of (7) him (8); but (9) should (10) I (11) anatomize (12) him (13) to (14) thee (15) as (16) he (17) is (18), I (19) must (20) blush (21) and (22) weep (23) and (24) thou (25) must (26) look (27) pale (28) and (29) wonder (30). I (31) am (32) heartily (33) glad (34) I (35) came (36) hither (37) to (38) you (39). If (40) he (41) come (42) to-morrow (43), I'll (44) give (45) him (46) his (47) payment (48): if (49) ever (50) he (51) go (52) alone (53) again (54), I'll (55) never (56) wrestle (57) for (58) prize (59) more (60): and (61) so (62) God (63) keep (64) your (65) worship (66)! Farewell (67), good (68) Charles (69). Now (70) will (71) I (72) stir (73) this (74) gamester (75): I (76) hope (77) I (78) shall (79) see (80) an (81) end (82) of (83) him (84); for (85) my (86) soul (87), yet (88) I (89) know (90) not (91) why (92), hates (93) nothing (94) more (95) than (96) he (97). Yet (98) he's (99) gentle (100), never (101) schooled (102) and (103) yet (104) learned (105), full (106) of (107) noble (108) device (109), of (110) all (111) sorts (112) enchantingly (113) beloved (114), and (115) indeed (116) so (117) much (118) in (119) the (120) heart (121) of (122) the (123) world (124), and (125) especially (126) of (127) my (128) own (129) people (130), who (131) best (132) know (133) him (134), that (135) I (136) am (137) altogether (138) misprised (139): but (140) it (141) shall (142) not (143) be (144) so (145) long (146); this (147) wrestler (148) shall (149) clear (150) all (151). Nothing (152) remains (153) but (154) that (155) I (156) kindle (157) the (158) boy (159) with (160) the (161) old (162) and (163) humorous (164) knights (165), and (166) after (167) some (168) remove (169), to (170) try (171) if (172) you (173) can (174) bring (175) him (176) to (177) the (178) new (179) court (180).
The word count is 180 words, which is within the 100-200 word range. I will now provide the plain text continuation.day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and so God keep your worship!
OLIVER	Farewell, good Charles.
[Exit CHARLES]
Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why, hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised: but it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all.
