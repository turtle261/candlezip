│  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it             │

│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you          │

│  young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the                │

│  addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'              │
│  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'                │
│  said the Lory.                                                             │
│  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about              │
│  her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for              │
│  catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her           │
│  after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look            │

│  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.                 │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began           │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts          │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │
│                                                                             │

│  Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.       │
│  CHAPTER IV                                                                 │
│  The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill                                          │
│  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                   │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!           │
│  Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me                   │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have                │
│  dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was            │
│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │
│  the little door, had vanished completely.                                  │
│                                                                             │

│  she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said   │
│  to herself `Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of    │
│  me?' Luckily for Alice, the little bottle had by this time had its full    │
│  effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as   │
│  there seemed to be no chance of her ever getting out of the room again,    │
│  except by growing smaller again, she began to cry again.                   │
│                                                                             │

│  then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the hedge!' then         │
│  silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold up his head--Brandy   │
│  now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you?'       │
│  Last came a little feeble squeaking voice (`That's Bill,' thought Alice),  │
│  `Well, I hardly know. I'm better now--but I'm too much frightened to say.  │
│  I fell upon the roof, you know,' and the words were accompanied by a       │
│  general chorus of `E-h, my dear, that is bad!'                             │
│  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here! Come and     │

│    `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I           │
│  am now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-          │
│  -but then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like          │
│  THAT!'                                                                     │

│    `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.  `How can you             │
│  learn lessons in here?  Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no           │
│  room at all for any lesson-books!'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,            │
│  and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few          │
│  minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves              │
│  this moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the                 │
│  stairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and          │
│  she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she           │
│  was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no          │
│  reason to be afraid of it.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;          │
│  but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed             │
│  hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it            │
│  say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she              │
│  fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly           │
│  spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not            │
│  get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,            │
│  and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was          │
│  just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something            │
│  of the sort.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are            │
│  you?'  And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then             │
│  I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!           │
│  Come and help me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.)             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.')            │
│                                                                             │
│    `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why, it               │
│  fills the whole window!'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.'              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it          │
│  away!'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear           │
│  whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer                │
│  honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at           │
│  last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in             │
│  the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more                │
│  sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there           │
│  must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for          │
│  pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I          │
│  don't want to stay in here any longer!'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at              │
│  last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a              │
│  good many voice all talking together:  she made out the words:             │
│  `Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;                │
│  Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up          │
│  at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half          │
│  high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-          │
│  -Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind            │
│  that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!  Heads below!' (a loud             │
│  crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go             │
│  down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,                │
│  then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to            │
│  go down the chimney!'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said               │
│  Alice to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!            │
│  I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is          │
│  narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'                      │
│                                                                             │
│    She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and              │
│  waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what          │
│  sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close          │
│  above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one           │
│  sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes            │
│  Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the               │
│  hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold          │
│  up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?          │
│  What happened to you?  Tell us all about it!'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'              │
│  thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm               │
│  better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know           │
│  is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes            │
│  like a sky-rocket!'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and              │
│  Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.  I'll set               │
│  Dinah at you!'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to                 │
│  herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any                │
│  sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they             │
│  began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A               │
│  barrowful will do, to begin with.'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to            │
│  doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came                 │
│  rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.           │
│  `I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,           │
│  `You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead              │
│  silence.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all               │
│  turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright           │
│  idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she               │
│  thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it              │
│  can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I                  │
│  suppose.'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find             │
│  that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small               │
│  enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and              │
│  found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.           │
│  The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by          │
│  two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.             │
│  They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she             │
│  ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a             │
│  thick wood.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she          │
│  wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;            │
│  and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.            │
│  I think that will be the best plan.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and              │
│  simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the             │
│  smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering               │
│  about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over             │
│  her head made her look up in a great hurry.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round               │
│  eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.              │
│  `Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried          │
│  hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the             │
│  time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it              │
│  would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.            │
│                                                                             │
│    Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of               │
│  stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped            │
│  into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,             │
│  and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice          │
│  dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run              │
│  over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy             │
│  made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in             │
│  its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very              │
│  like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every          │
│  moment to be trampled under its feet, ran                                  │
│                                                                             │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │

│  at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way  │
│  back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good  │
│  way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great  │
│  eyes half shut.                                                            │

│  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set  │
│  off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till  │
│  the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant        │
│  against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the    │
│  leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd     │
│  only been the right size to do it!  Oh dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that    │
│  I've got to grow up again!  Let me see--how IS it to be managed?  I        │

│  The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round her at     │
│  the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that     │
│  looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.       │
│  There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as      │
│  herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and    │
│  behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what     │
│  was on the top of it.                                                      │

│  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the        │
│  mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that  │
│  was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long        │
│  hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else."    │
│                                                                             │
│  The continuation starts after "ran".                                       │
│  The text immediately following "ran" is: "round the thistle again; then    │

There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else."

The continuation starts after "ran".
The text immediately following "ran" is: "round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut."

Let's extract 100-200 words from this point.

"round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

`And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let me see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'"
