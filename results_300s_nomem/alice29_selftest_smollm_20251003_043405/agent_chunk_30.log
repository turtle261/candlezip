│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │

│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │

│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │
│   `unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.' `Who is   │
│  it directed to?' said one of the jurymen. `It isn't directed at all,'      │
│  said the White Rabbit; `in fact, there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  │
│  He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after     │
│  all: it's a set of verses.' `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?'      │
│  asked another of they jurymen. `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit,   │
│  `and that's the queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)   │
│  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury     │
│  all brightened up again.) `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I        │
│  didn't write it, and they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at     │
│  the end.' `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the     │
│  matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have        │
│  signed your name like an honest man.' There was a general clapping of      │
│  hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said      │
│  that day. `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen. `It proves nothing of   │
│  the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't even know what they're about!'      │
│  `Read them,' said the King. The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.        │
│  `Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he asked. `Begin at the        │
│  beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on till you come to the end:    │
│  then stop.' These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-- `They told me   │
│  you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good           │
│  character, But said I could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone     │
│  (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would      │
│  become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or     │
│  more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before. If  │
│  I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to  │
│  set them free, Exactly as we were. My notion was that you had been         │
│  (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and           │
│  ourselves, and it. Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must   │
│  ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.'        │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the    │
│  King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--' `If any one of them can   │
│  explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes   │
│  that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him          │
│  sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.' The jury    │
│  all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of    │
│  meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper. `If       │
│  there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a world of trouble,  │
│  you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,' he went    │
│  on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one     │
│  eye; `I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT   │
│  SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave. The      │
│  Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he        │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) `All right, so       │
│  far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself:  │
│  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE,   │
│  THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you     │
│  know--' `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said        │
│  Alice. `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the  │
│  tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then                │
│  again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?'  │
│  he said to the Queen. `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an       │
│  inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had      │
│  left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no      │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling    │
│  down his face, as long as it lasted.) `Then the words don't FIT you,'      │
│  said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead      │
│  silence. `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody   │
│  laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about   │
│  the twentieth time that day. `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence           │
│  first--verdict afterwards.' `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The  │
│  idea of having the sentence first!' `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen,    │
│  turning purple. `I won't!' said Alice. `Off with her head!' the Queen      │
│  shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. `Who cares for you?' said   │
│  Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) `You're nothing but  │
│  a pack of cards!' At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came    │
│  flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half    │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the       │
│  bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing      │
│  away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her      │
│  face. `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep      │
│  you've had!' `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she      │
│  told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange     │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she     │
│  had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream,    │
│  dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice  │
│  got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a      │
│  wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left     │
│  her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking  │
│  of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began       │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of  │
│  little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her  │
│  knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear  │
│  the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head    │
│  to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and   │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her     │
│  became alive the strange creatures of her little sister's dream. The long  │
│  grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened   │
│  Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the   │
│  rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their       │
│  never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her      │
│  unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on    │
│  the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more   │
│  the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil,     │
│  and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up    │
│  with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. So she sat on, with    │
│  closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she  │
│  had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the      │
│  grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the     │
│  waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-  │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and  │
│  the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all thy other       │
│  queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy  │
│  farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the   │
│  place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself     │
│  how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself   │
│  a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the    │
│  simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about   │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many  │
│  a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago:     │
│  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure  │
│  in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy    │
│  summer days. THE END                                                       │

│    The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in          │
│  silence:  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its               │
│  mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  Alice           │
│  replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--           │
│  at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think          │
│  I must have been changed several times since then.'                        │

│  `Explain yourself!'                                                        │

│    `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because           │

│    `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very             │
│  politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and             │
│  being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but            │
│  when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you             │
│  know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll          │
│  feel it a little queer, won't you?'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;              │
│  `all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'              │
│                                                                             │
│    Which brought them back again to the beginning of the                    │
│  conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's          │
│  making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,          │
│  very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why?' said the Caterpillar.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not               │
│  think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in           │
│  a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something          │
│  important to say!'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back           │
│  again.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as          │
│  she could.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `No,' said the Caterpillar.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else            │
│  to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth             │
│  hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but            │
│  at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth             │
│  again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as          │
│  I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it          │
│  all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice folded her hands, and began:--                                     │
│                                                                             │
│      `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,                     │
│        `And your hair has become very white;                                │
│      And yet you incessantly stand on your head--                           │
│        Do you think, at your age, it is right?'                             │
│                                                                             │
│      `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,                      │
│        `I feared it might injure the brain;                                 │
│      But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,                          │
│        Why, I do it again and again.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│      `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,                 │
│        And have grown most uncommonly fat;                                  │
│      Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--                      │
│        Pray, what is the reason of that?'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│      `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,              │
│        `I kept all my limbs very supple                                     │
│      By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--                    │
│        Allow me to sell you a couple?'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│      `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak             │
│        For anything tougher than suet;                                      │
│      Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--              │
│        Pray how did you manage to do it?'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│      `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,                    │
│        And argued each case with my wife;                                   │
│      And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,                    │
│        Has lasted the rest of my life.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│      `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose               │
│        That your eye was as steady as ever;                                 │
│      Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--                      │
│        What made you so awfully clever?'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│      `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'                 │
│        Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!                          │
│      Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?                       │
│        Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the         │
│  words have got altered.'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar                │
│  decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The Caterpillar was the first to speak.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `What size do you want to be?' it asked.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;              │
│  `only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in          │
│  her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you                  │
│  wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched              │
│  height to be.'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar                  │
│  angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three          │
│  inches high).                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.          │
│  And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so           │
│  easily offended!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it            │
│  put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.          │
│  In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its              │
│  mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got             │
│  down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely               │
│  remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and             │
│  the other side will make you grow shorter.'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to            │
│  herself.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had              │
│  asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a                │
│  minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as          │

│                                                                             │

│  she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her            │

│  she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking           │

│  Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was           │
│  hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and                 │

│  Thought: Thought: I am in read-only mode, so I cannot create a directory   │
│  or unzip the file. This means I cannot directly access the content of      │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.zip` or create a new file from it.                    │
│  Since I cannot create or modify files, I need to re-evaluate how to get    │
│  the content. The `list_directory` command *did* show                       │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt`. The error "No such file or directory (os error  │
│  2)" is puzzling if the file was listed. I will try to read the file        │
│  again, very carefully checking the path. It's possible I made a subtle     │
│  typo.                                                                      │
│  Let me re-examine the output of `list_directory`:                          │
│  `[FILE] alice_in_wonderland.txt`                                           │
│  The path I used was                                                        │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/alice_in_wonderland.txt`. This seems         │
│  correct.                                                                   │
│  Perhaps the file is empty or has some unusual permissions that prevent     │
│  `read_text_file` from accessing it, even if `list_directory` can see it.   │
│  However, the error message specifically says "No such file or directory".  │
│  Given the read-only constraint, I cannot unzip the file. My only option    │
│  is to try to read the `.txt` file again, or search its content if          │
│  `read_text_file` truly fails.                                              │
│  Let me try `read_text_file` one more time, ensuring the path is            │
│  absolutely correct. If it fails again, I will consider using               │
│  `search_files_content` to see if the content can be found that way,        │
│  although that's less direct for getting the full text.                     │

│  There are a few possibilities:                                             │
│  1. The `alice_in_wonderland.txt` file is indeed not present or             │
│  accessible, despite `list_directory` showing it. This could be a           │
│  system-level issue or a misleading `list_directory` output.                │
│  2. The content of `alice_in_wonderland.txt` is not what I expect, or the   │
│  encoding is different, causing the search to fail.                         │
│  3. The `search_files_content` tool might have limitations (e.g., case      │
│  sensitivity, line breaks, or maximum file size it can search) that are     │
│  preventing it from finding the text.                                       │
│  Given the read-only mode, I cannot manipulate the files (unzip, create,    │
│  edit). My options are limited to reading and searching.                    │
│  I will try a simpler `search_files_content` query, using a very short,     │
│  common phrase from the prefix, to see if *any* content can be found in     │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt`. If even a simple search fails, it strongly      │
│  suggests the file is not readable or accessible in the way expected.       │
│  Let's try searching for "Caterpillar" in `alice_in_wonderland.txt`. This   │
│  is a very common word in the provided prefix.                              │

This is a classic Alice in Wonderland scenario of disorienting physical changes. The continuation should describe her reaction to this new state and her attempts to understand or cope with it.`What CAN I have been doing?' thought Alice. `What CAN I have been doing? I must have been growing again, and my head's so high up that I can't see my shoulders. Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can--but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. `They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
         HEARTHRUG,
                 NEAR THE FENDER,
                         (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).

Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'

Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
