│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │

│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │
│  , `unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'          │
│  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                          │
│  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact, there's       │
│  nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and    │
│  added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'                │
│  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of they jurymen.   │
│  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the queerest thing   │
│  about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)                                  │
│  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury     │
│  all brightened up again.)                                                  │
│  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and they can't  │
│  prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'                           │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the matter        │
│  worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your   │
│  name like an honest man.'                                                  │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really     │
│  clever thing the King had said that day.                                   │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't even know     │
│  what they're about!'                                                       │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin, please your  │
│  Majesty?' he asked.                                                        │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on till you come  │
│  to the end: then stop.'                                                    │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a  │
│  good character, But said I could not swim.                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should    │
│  push the matter on, What would become of you?                              │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all     │
│  returned from him to you, Though they were mine before.                    │
│  If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you  │
│  to set them free, Exactly as we were.                                      │
│  My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle      │
│  that came between Him, and ourselves, and it.                              │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret,    │
│  kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.'                          │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the    │
│  King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                           │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large   │
│  in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting       │
│  him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of        │
│  meaning in it.'                                                            │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe there's an   │
│  atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.   │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a world of       │
│  trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'   │
│  he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them      │
│  with one eye; `I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I    │
│  COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the       │
│  Knave.                                                                     │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he    │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)                      │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the      │
│  verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of          │
│  course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he   │
│  did with the tarts, you know--'                                            │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.         │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts   │
│  on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE   │
│  HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the      │
│  Queen.                                                                     │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as   │
│  she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate  │
│  with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began     │
│  again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it      │
│  lasted.)                                                                   │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court     │
│  with a smile. There was a dead silence.                                    │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,   │
│  `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the        │
│  twentieth time that day.                                                   │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having the sentence  │
│  first!'                                                                    │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody     │
│  moved.                                                                     │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this   │
│  time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                               │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon     │
│  her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and       │
│  tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her      │
│  head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead      │
│  leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.               │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep you've     │
│  had!'                                                                      │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister,  │
│  as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers   │
│  that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her      │
│  sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly:     │
│  but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran    │
│  off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it  │
│  had been.                                                                  │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her     │
│  hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her   │
│  wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and     │
│  this was her dream:--                                                      │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands  │
│  were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up      │
│  into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer  │
│  little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always  │
│  get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the     │
│  whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little    │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the     │
│  frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she       │
│  could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends     │
│  shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen          │
│  ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby   │
│  was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed        │
│  around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the       │
│  Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,      │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock       │
│  Turtle.                                                                    │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,  │
│  though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to    │
│  dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool   │
│  rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to  │
│  tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the     │
│  shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and   │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused        │
│  clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the       │
│  distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.             │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers        │
│  would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would      │
│  keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her      │
│  childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and   │
│  make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even    │
│  with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all  │
│  their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,        │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│  the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt                             │
│  certain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any          │
│  more if you'd rather not.'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end          │
│  of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family           │
│  always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear          │
│  the name again!'                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the             │
│  subject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'            │
│  The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is             │
│  such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!           │
│  A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly           │
│  brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and               │
│  it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I            │
│  can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you               │
│  know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!             │
│  He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a              │
│  sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the              │
│  Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and               │
│  making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back                │
│  again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't           │
│  like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam           │
│  slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice          │
│  thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to             │
│  the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll                   │
│  understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded           │
│  with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a          │
│  Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious           │
│  creatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the             │
│  shore.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the             │
│  bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their             │
│  fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and               │
│  uncomfortable.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they            │
│  had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed           │
│  quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with             │
│  them, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had              │
│  quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,             │
│  and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';           │
│  and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,             │
│  and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no          │
│  more to be said.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among          │
│  them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL           │
│  soon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a large          │
│  ring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice kept her eyes                   │
│  anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad             │
│  cold if she did not get dry very soon.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?        │
│  This is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round, if you please!        │

│    `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very                  │
│  politely:  `Did you speak?'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I thought you did,' said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  "Edwin and          │

│                                                                             │
│    `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you            │
│  know what "it" means.'                                                     │

│    `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said          │
│  the Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,             │
│  what did the archbishop find?'                                             │

│  `"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William           │

│  getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it             │
│  spoke.                                                                     │

│    `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't          │
│  seem to dry me at all.'                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I           │
│  move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more          │
│  energetic remedies--'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning of          │
│  half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do            │
│  either!'  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:               │
│  some of the other birds tittered audibly.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,            │
│  `was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'           │
│                                                                             │
│    `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much            │
│  to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY            │
│  ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'          │
│  (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter             │
│  day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)                             │
│                                                                             │
│    First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the            │
│  exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party              │
│  were placed along the course, here and there.  There was no `One,          │
│  two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,             │
│  and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know              │
│  when the race was over.  However, when they had been running half          │
│  an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called          │
│  out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,            │
│  and asking, `But who has won?'                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of          │
│  thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon           │
│  its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,           │
│  in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.  At             │
│  last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have                  │
│  prizes.'                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices                │
│  asked.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with             │
│  one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,                 │
│  calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand            │
│  in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt          │
│  water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.               │
│  There was exactly one a-piece all round.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have             │
│  you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo                │
│  solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of          │
│  this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short                │
│  speech, they all cheered.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked           │
│  so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not             │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
