│  Tool Args: {'plan': '\n1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):**    │
│  The primary objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy by    │
│  providing the exact, immediate continuation of the given text prefix.      │
│  This involves leveraging external information sources (the file system     │
│  via available tools) as an entropy sink to retrieve the precise content,   │
│  thereby reducing the language model\'s uncertainty about subsequent        │
│  tokens. The text prefix clearly indicates the source is "Alice\'s          │
│  Adventures in Wonderland."\n\n2.  **Key Steps:**\n    *   **Identify       │
│  Source:** Confirm the source document is "Alice\'s Adventures in           │
│  Wonderland."\n    *   **Locate Document:** Search the allowed directory    │
│  (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) for a file containing the provided        │
│  prefix.\n    *   **Extract Continuation:** Once the correct file is        │
│  identified, read its content, locate the exact prefix, and extract the     │
│  subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.\n\n3.  **Approach to Challenges:**\n    │
│  *   **File Discovery:** If a direct search for the prefix is               │
│  unsuccessful, I will broaden the search to include the book title or       │
│  author within the directory to locate potential source files.\n    *       │
│  **Prefix Mismatch:** The task specifies "exact immediate continuation."    │
│  If the prefix is not found verbatim, I will re-evaluate the search query   │
│  or consider alternative search strategies (e.g., searching for smaller,    │
│  unique phrases from the prefix).\n    *   **Content Extraction:** After    │
│  locating the prefix, I will use precise string manipulation to ensure      │
│  only the continuation is extracted, without any additional formatting or   │
│  commentary.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                        │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: I will first  │
│  use this tool to get an overview of the files present in the designated    │
│  sink directory. This helps in quickly identifying potentially relevant     │
│  files by name.\n    *                                                      │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'ying the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players,  │
│  and shouting `Off with his head!\' or `Off with her head!\' Those whom     │
│  she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had   │
│  to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour   │
│  or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King,     │
│  the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of                │
│  execution.\')`**: I will use a significant and unique portion of the       │
│  provided prefix as the query to precisely locate the file containing this  │
│  text. This is the most efficient way to find the exact source.\n    *      │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`**: Once the file path is    │
│  identified from the `search_files_content` result, I will use this tool    │
│  to read the entire content of that file.\n    *   **Python String          │
│  Operations (internal):** After reading the file content, I will use        │
│  Python\'s built-in string methods (e.g., `find()` and slicing) to locate   │
│  the exact end of the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200             │
│  words.\n\n5.  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text output consisting of the  │
│  verbatim continuation (100-200 words) of the provided prefix. This         │
│  outcome directly fulfills the task requirements and contributes to         │
│  entropy minimization by providing highly accurate and relevant predictive  │
│  information.\n', 'ready': True}                                            │

│  they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'                │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd             │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the                  │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't               │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,              │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end: then stop.'                                      │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't            │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And             │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you                │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.              │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's              │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                 │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my             │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off             │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.                          │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having               │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                  │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half           │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's           │
│  getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she             │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about              │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their              │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│  ying the Queen never left off                                              │
│  quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his             │
│  head!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were              │
│  taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave             │
│  off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour            │
│  or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the           │
│  King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of          │
│  execution.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to                │
│  Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his              │
│  history,'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low           │
│  voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come,           │
│  THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite          │
│  unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the             │
│  sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)          │
│  `Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to             │
│  see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and          │
│  see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,             │
│  leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like            │
│  the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would            │
│  be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage                │
│  Queen:  so she waited.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the             │
│  Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'           │
│  said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `What IS the fun?' said Alice.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they          │
│  never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went             │
│  slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,            │
│  never!'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the             │
│  distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,           │
│  as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart          │
│  would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she            │
│  asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the            │
│  same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got            │
│  no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with              │
│  large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to              │
│  know your history, she do.'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow               │
│  tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've            │
│  finished.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice              │
│  thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he             │
│  doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was           │
│  a real Turtle.'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only            │
│  by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and           │
│  the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very             │
│  nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your                    │
│  interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be          │
│  more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more             │
│  calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to            │
│  school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call          │
│  him Tortoise--'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock             │
│  Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple            │
│  question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and            │
│  looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At           │
│  last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!           │
│  Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe            │
│  it--'                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak          │
│  again.  The Mock Turtle went on.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school               │
│  every day--'                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be            │
│  so proud as all that.'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock              │
│  Turtle in a tone of great relief.  `Now at OURS they had at the            │
│  end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the           │
│  bottom of the sea.'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a             │
│  sigh.  `I only took the regular course.'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `What was that?' inquired Alice.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock               │
│  Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--           │
│  Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.  `What         │
│  is it?'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  `What!  Never          │
│  heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.  `You know what to beautify             │
│  is, I suppose?'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--           │
│  prettier.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to            │
│  uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about            │
│  it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you          │
│  to learn?'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting             │
│  off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,          │
│  with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old            │
│  conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us                   │
│  Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `What was THAT like?' said Alice.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said:  `I'm          │
│  too stiff.  And the Gryphon never learnt it.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon:  `I went to the Classics                │
│  master, though.  He was an old crab, HE was.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  `he            │
│  taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;           │
│  and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a          │
│  hurry to change the subject.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the               │
│  next, and so on.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon                  │
│  remarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a            │
│  little before she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day            │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The primary objective is  │
│  to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact,        │
│  immediate continuation of the given text prefix. This involves leveraging  │
│  external information sources (the file system via available tools) as an   │
│  entropy sink to retrieve the precise content, thereby reducing the         │
│  language model's uncertainty about subsequent tokens. The text prefix      │
│  clearly indicates the source is "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."        │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps:**                                                         │
│      *   **Identify Source:** Confirm the source document is "Alice's       │
│  Adventures in Wonderland."                                                 │
│      *   **Locate Document:** Search the allowed directory                  │
│  (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) for a file containing the provided        │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│      *   **Extract Continuation:** Once the correct file is identified,     │
│  read its content, locate the exact prefix, and extract the subsequent      │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach to Challenges:**                                            │
│      *   **File Discovery:** If a direct search for the prefix is           │
│  unsuccessful, I will broaden the search to include the book title or       │
│  author within the directory to locate potential source files.              │
│      *   **Prefix Mismatch:** The task specifies "exact immediate           │
│  continuation." If the prefix is not found verbatim, I will re-evaluate     │
│  the search query or consider alternative search strategies (e.g.,          │
│  searching for smaller, unique phrases from the prefix).                    │
│      *   **Content Extraction:** After locating the prefix, I will use      │
│  precise string manipulation to ensure only the continuation is extracted,  │
│  without any additional formatting or commentary.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: I will  │
│  first use this tool to get an overview of the files present in the         │
│  designated sink directory. This helps in quickly identifying potentially   │
│  relevant files by name.                                                    │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='ying the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players,   │
│  and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she   │
│  sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to    │
│  leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or   │
│  so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the    │
│  Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.')`**:   │
│  I will use a significant and unique portion of the provided prefix as the  │
│  query to precisely locate the file containing this text. This is the most  │
│  efficient way to find the exact source.                                    │
│      *   **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`**: Once the file      │
│  path is identified from the `search_files_content` result, I will use      │
│  this tool to read the entire content of that file.                         │
│      *   **Python String Operations (internal):** After reading the file    │
│  content, I will use Python's built-in string methods (e.g., `find()` and   │
│  slicing) to locate the exact end of the prefix and extract the subsequent  │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text output consisting of the verbatim   │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided prefix. This outcome          │
│  directly fulfills the task requirements and contributes to entropy         │
│  minimization by providing highly accurate and relevant predictive          │
│  information.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
