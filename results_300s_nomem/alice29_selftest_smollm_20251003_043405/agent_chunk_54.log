│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │
│   nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                                     │
│  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                          │
│  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,               │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │
│  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of                 │
│  they jurymen.                                                              │
│  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the                  │
│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.               │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and             │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the                 │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │

│  reply.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,              │
│  turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very              │
│  politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of          │
│  cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three               │
│  gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as              │
│  they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs             │
│  was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether           │
│  they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her            │
│  own children.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.           │
│  `It's no business of MINE.'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her            │
│  for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!               │
│  Off--'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the               │
│  Queen was silent.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said                    │
│  `Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave            │
│  `Turn them over!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the               │
│  three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the               │
│  King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'              │
│  And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you            │
│  been doing here?'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,           │
│  going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the            │
│  roses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,               │
│  three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate          │
│  gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a            │
│  large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered             │
│  about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly              │
│  marched off after the others.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers          │
│  shouted in reply.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'              │
│                                                                             │
│    The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question           │
│  was evidently meant for her.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes!' shouted Alice.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the                  │
│  procession, wondering very much what would happen next.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.            │
│  She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously             │
│  into her face.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He               │
│  looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised            │
│  himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and                   │
│  whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `What for?' said Alice.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.          │
│  I said "What for?"'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a           │
│  little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a          │
│  frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came             │
│  rather late, and the Queen said--'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,           │
│  and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up              │
│  against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or          │
│  two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a          │
│  curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and                  │
│  furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live                   │
│  flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to            │
│  stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her            │
│  flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,                  │
│  comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,             │
│  but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened            │
│  out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it           │
│  WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a              │
│  puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:          │
│  and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,          │
│  it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled               │
│  itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,            │
│  there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she              │
│  wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers            │
│  were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the               │
│  ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very               │
│  difficult game indeed.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The players all played at once without waiting for turns,                │
│  quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in          │
│  a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went             │
│  stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with             │
│  her head!' about once in a minute.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as             │
│  yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might             │
│  happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of          │

│                                                                             │
│    She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering              │
│  whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a          │
│  curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at                │
│  first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to          │
│  be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I          │
│  shall have somebody to talk to.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was             │
│  mouth enough for it to speak with.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no          │
│  use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at          │
│  least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,            │
│  and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the          │
│  game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The             │
│  Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and          │
│  no more of it appeared.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather          │
│  a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't          │
│  hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in               │
│  particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and            │
│  you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;             │
│  for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next                 │
│  walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have            │
│  croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it          │
│  saw mine coming!'                                                          │

│    `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then             │
│  she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so            │
│  she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while                │
│  finishing the game.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │

│    `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and          │
│  looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me          │
│  to introduce it.'                                                          │

│    `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:  `however,          │
│  it may kiss my hand if it likes.'                                          │

│    `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me             │
│  like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.                              │
