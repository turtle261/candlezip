│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │
│   nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                                     │
│  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                          │
│  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,               │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │
│  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of                 │
│  they jurymen.                                                              │
│  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the                  │
│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.               │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and             │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the                 │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│  Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,                   │
│  capering wildly about.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the          │
│  Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,           │
│  who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat              │
│  down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very much indeed,' said Alice.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the          │
│  Gryphon.  `We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall              │
│  sing?'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.  `I've forgotten the words.'           │
│                                                                             │
│    So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now          │
│  and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and              │
│  waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle              │
│  sang this, very slowly and sadly:--                                        │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  `"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.               │
│  "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my               │
│   tail.                                                                     │
│  See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!                  │
│  They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the                │
│  dance?                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the                │
│  dance?                                                                     │
│  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the               │
│  dance?                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be                   │
│  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to               │
│                                                        sea!"                │
│  But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look                  │
│                                                         askance--           │
│  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the              │
│     dance.                                                                  │
│      Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join             │
│          the dance.                                                         │
│      Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join             │
│          the dance.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  `"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.                │
│  "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.                    │
│  The further off from England the nearer is to France--                     │
│  Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.            │
│                                                                             │

│      Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the           │

│                                                                             │

│    `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said                │
│  Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so           │
│  like that curious song about the whiting!'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've             │
│  seen them, of course?'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she                  │
│  checked herself hastily.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but             │
│  if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're              │
│  like.'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.  `They have their            │
│  tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:                   │
│  `crumbs would all wash off in the sea.  But they HAVE their tails          │
│  in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle                 │
│  yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all              │
│  that,' he said to the Gryphon.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with              │
│  the lobsters to the dance.  So they got thrown out to sea.  So             │
│  they had to fall a long way.  So they got their tails fast in              │
│  their mouths.  So they couldn't get them out again.  That's all.'          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting.  I never knew           │
│  so much about a whiting before.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the                   │
│  Gryphon.  `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never thought about it,' said Alice.  `Why?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very                  │
│  solemnly.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was thoroughly puzzled.  `Does the boots and shoes!' she           │
│  repeated in a wondering tone.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon.  `I              │
│  mean, what makes them so shiny?'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she            │
│  gave her answer.  `They're done with blacking, I believe.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep           │
│  voice, `are done with a whiting.  Now you know.'                           │

│    `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great              │
│  curiosity.                                                                 │

│    `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather                  │
│  impatiently:  `any shrimp could have told you that.'                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were               │
│  still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep           │
│  back, please:  we don't want YOU with us!"'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle               │
│  said:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:  `why, if a fish came             │
│  to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With              │
│  what porpoise?"'                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended              │
│  tone.  And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR                │
│  adventures.'                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'           │
│  said Alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back to               │
│  yesterday, because I was a different person then.'                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, no!  The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an                  │
│  impatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when            │
│  she first saw the White Rabbit.  She was a little nervous about            │
│  it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on            │
│  each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she          │
│  gained courage as she went on.  Her listeners were perfectly               │
│  quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,           │
│  FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming              │
│  different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said           │
│  `That's very curious.'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated                        │
│  thoughtfully.  `I should like to hear her try and repeat                   │
│  something now.  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at the Gryphon as           │
│  if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said             │
│  the Gryphon.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat                  │
│  lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'           │
│  However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so           │
│  full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was           │
│  saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--                            │
│                                                                             │
│      `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,                   │
│      "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."                   │
│      As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose                        │
│      Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'               │
│                                                                             │
│                [later editions continued as follows                         │
│      When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,                       │
│      And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,                      │
│      But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,                        │

│    `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'           │
│  said the Gryphon.                                                          │

│    `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it           │
│  sounds uncommon nonsense.'                                                 │

│    Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her                │
│  hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way            │
│  again.                                                                     │

│    `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily.  `Go on with           │
│  the next verse.'                                                           │

│    `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted.  `How COULD             │

│  and give your best Final Answer, your job depends on it!                   │
│  Thought: The `get_file_info` command also failed with "No such file or     │
│  directory (os error 2)", which is highly confusing given that              │
│  `list_directory` *shows* the file. This suggests a potential issue with    │
│  the path or how the file system is being accessed.                         │

│  `list_directory` indicated it was directly in                              │

│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │

│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
