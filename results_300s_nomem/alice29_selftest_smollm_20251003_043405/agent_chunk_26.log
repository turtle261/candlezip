│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The   │
│  primary objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy by        │
│  providing the most informative context. This means finding the exact,      │
│  verbatim continuation of the given text prefix. An exact match from a      │
│  known source acts as a perfect entropy sink, significantly reducing        │
│  uncertainty for subsequent tokens. The target continuation length is       │
│  100-200 words.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    *   **Initial Directory Scan:**   │
│  Use `directory_tree` and `list_directory_with_sizes` to understand the     │
│  file structure and identify potential source files within                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    *   **Formulate Search Query:**       │
│  Extract a sufficiently long and unique portion of the provided prefix to   │
│  serve as a precise search query. The prefix ends with "ran", and the       │
│  preceding sentence is "then Alice, thinking it was very like having a      │
│  game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled  │
│  under its feet, ran". I will use this full sentence as the query.\n    *   │
│  **Execute Content Search:** Use `search_files_content` with the            │
│  formulated query within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.\n    │
│  *   **Retrieve and Extract:** If a file is found, use `read_text_file` to  │
│  get its content. Locate the exact position of the prefix and extract the   │
│  subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.\n    *   **Format Output:** Ensure the  │
│  output is plain text only, without any markdown, analysis, or commentary,  │
│  as specified by the task.\n\n3. **Approach Challenges:**\n    *   **No     │
│  Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` yields no results, I will         │
│  re-evaluate the query, perhaps shortening it slightly or trying different  │
│  parts of the prefix. If still no exact match is found within the allowed   │
│  directory, I will have to generate a contextually relevant continuation    │
│  based on the prefix, as per the "If ALL tools fail" instruction, though    │
│  the task strongly implies the source is present.\n    *   **Tool           │
│  Limitations:** I am restricted to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`       │
│  directory and the provided tools. I cannot use external web search         │
│  engines or other knowledge bases, despite their mention in the general     │
│  instructions.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *   **Tool 1:           │
│  `directory_tree`**\n        *   **Purpose:** To get a hierarchical view    │
│  of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, helping to identify       │
│  potential subdirectories or file types.\n        *   **Execution:**        │
│  `print(default_api.directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\'))  │
│  `\n    *   **Tool 2: `list_directory_with_sizes`**\n        *              │
│  **Purpose:** To list all files and their sizes in the root of the          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, providing more detail than       │
│  `directory_tree` for the immediate files.\n        *   **Execution:**      │
│  `print(default_api.list_directory_with_sizes(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documen  │
│  ts/sink\'))`\n    *   **Tool 3: `search_files_content`**\n        *        │
│  **Purpose:** To locate the file containing the exact prefix. This is the   │
│  most critical step for finding the source.\n        *   **Query:** "then   │
│  Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse,  │
│  and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran"\n        *  │
│  **Execution:**                                                             │
│  `print(default_api.search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/si  │
│  nk\', query=\'then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play  │
│  with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its     │
│  feet, ran\'))`\n    *   **Tool 4: `read_text_file`**\n        *            │
│  **Purpose:** Once `search_files_content` identifies a file, this tool      │
│  will read its entire content to allow for precise extraction of the        │
│  continuation.\n        *   **Execution:**                                  │
│  `print(default_api.read_text_file(path=\'<path_to_found_file>\'))` (This   │
│  will be executed after a file is identified.)\n\n5. **Expected             │
│  Outcome:**\n    *   A 100-200 word plain text string representing the      │
│  verbatim continuation of the provided prefix. This will directly achieve   │
│  the goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by supplying the    │
│  exact next sequence of tokens from the source.\n', 'ready': True}          │

│  `Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;                │
│  Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up          │

│  down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,                │

│  waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what          │

│  above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one           │

│  hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold          │
│  up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?          │

│  herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any                │

│  began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A               │

│  rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.           │
│  `I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,           │
│  `You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead              │

│                                                                             │
│    Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all               │
│  turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright           │
│  idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she               │
│  thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it              │
│  can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I                  │
│  suppose.'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find             │
│  that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small               │
│  enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and              │
│  found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.           │
│  The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by          │
│  two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.             │
│  They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she             │
│  ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a             │
│  thick wood.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she          │
│  wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;            │
│  and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.            │
│  I think that will be the best plan.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and              │
│  simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the             │
│  smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering               │
│  about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over             │
│  her head made her look up in a great hurry.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round               │
│  eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.              │
│  `Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried          │
│  hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the             │
│  time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it              │
│  would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.            │
│                                                                             │
│    Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of               │
│  stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped            │
│  into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,             │
│  and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice          │
│  dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run              │
│  over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy             │
│  made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in             │
│  its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very              │
│  like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every          │
│  moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle                │
│  again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the               │
│  stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long             │
│  way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat          │
│  down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its           │
│  mouth, and its great eyes half shut.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;           │
│  so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out           │
│  of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the            │
│  distance.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she            │
│  leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself              │
│  with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks           │
│  very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh               │
│  dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let           │
│  me see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or              │
│  drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'                │
│                                                                             │
│    The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round          │
│  her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see            │
│  anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under            │
│  the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,           │
│  about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under            │
│  it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her             │
│  that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.             │
│                                                                             │
│    She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of          │
│  the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large                │
│  caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,             │
│  quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice          │
│  of her or of anything else.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                              CHAPTER V                                      │
│                                                                             │
│                      Advice from a Caterpillar                              │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in          │
│  silence:  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its               │
│  mouth, and addressed her in a langu                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The primary objective is   │
│  to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the most          │
│  informative context. This means finding the exact, verbatim continuation   │
│  of the given text prefix. An exact match from a known source acts as a     │
│  perfect entropy sink, significantly reducing uncertainty for subsequent    │
│  tokens. The target continuation length is 100-200 words.                   │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   **Initial Directory Scan:** Use `directory_tree` and               │
│  `list_directory_with_sizes` to understand the file structure and identify  │
│  potential source files within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.              │
│      *   **Formulate Search Query:** Extract a sufficiently long and        │
│  unique portion of the provided prefix to serve as a precise search query.  │
│  The prefix ends with "ran", and the preceding sentence is "then Alice,     │
│  thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and     │
│  expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran". I will use     │
│  this full sentence as the query.                                           │
│      *   **Execute Content Search:** Use `search_files_content` with the    │
│  formulated query within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.      │
│      *   **Retrieve and Extract:** If a file is found, use                  │
│  `read_text_file` to get its content. Locate the exact position of the      │
│  prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.                  │
│      *   **Format Output:** Ensure the output is plain text only, without   │
│  any markdown, analysis, or commentary, as specified by the task.           │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      *   **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` yields no results,   │
│  I will re-evaluate the query, perhaps shortening it slightly or trying     │
│  different parts of the prefix. If still no exact match is found within     │
│  the allowed directory, I will have to generate a contextually relevant     │
│  continuation based on the prefix, as per the "If ALL tools fail"           │
│  instruction, though the task strongly implies the source is present.       │
│      *   **Tool Limitations:** I am restricted to the                       │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory and the provided tools. I cannot  │
│  use external web search engines or other knowledge bases, despite their    │
│  mention in the general instructions.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   **Tool 1: `directory_tree`**                                       │
│          *   **Purpose:** To get a hierarchical view of the                 │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, helping to identify potential    │
│  subdirectories or file types.                                              │
│          *   **Execution:**                                                 │
│  `print(default_api.directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink'))`   │
│      *   **Tool 2: `list_directory_with_sizes`**                            │
│          *   **Purpose:** To list all files and their sizes in the root of  │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, providing more detail than   │
│  `directory_tree` for the immediate files.                                  │
│          *   **Execution:**                                                 │
│  `print(default_api.list_directory_with_sizes(path='/C/Users/Noah/Document  │
│  s/sink'))`                                                                 │
│      *   **Tool 3: `search_files_content`**                                 │
│          *   **Purpose:** To locate the file containing the exact prefix.   │
│  This is the most critical step for finding the source.                     │
│          *   **Query:** "then Alice, thinking it was very like having a     │
│  game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled  │
│  under its feet, ran"                                                       │
│          *   **Execution:**                                                 │
│  `print(default_api.search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sin  │
│  k', query='then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play     │
│  with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its     │
│  feet, ran'))`                                                              │
│      *   **Tool 4: `read_text_file`**                                       │
│          *   **Purpose:** Once `search_files_content` identifies a file,    │
│  this tool will read its entire content to allow for precise extraction of  │
│  the continuation.                                                          │
│          *   **Execution:**                                                 │
│  `print(default_api.read_text_file(path='<path_to_found_file>'))` (This     │
│  will be executed after a file is identified.)                              │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:**                                                   │
│      *   A 100-200 word plain text string representing the verbatim         │
│  continuation of the provided prefix. This will directly achieve the goal   │
│  of minimizing future token prediction entropy by supplying the exact next  │
│  sequence of tokens from the source.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The directory tree shows a `cantrbry` directory which    │

│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", `alice29.txt` is a very strong         │
│  candidate for the source document.                                         │
│  Now I will use `search_files_content` to confirm if the prefix exists in   │
│  `alice29.txt`. The prefix ends with "ran", and the last full sentence      │
│  before "ran" is: "then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of   │
│  play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under    │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
│                                                                             │
