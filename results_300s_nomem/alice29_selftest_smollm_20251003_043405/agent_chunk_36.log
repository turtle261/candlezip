│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '\n1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL     │
│  Framework):** The primary goal is to minimize future token prediction      │
│  entropy by providing the most precise and contextually rich continuation   │
│  of the given text prefix. This aligns with the SIMDL framework by          │
│  leveraging external information sources (my tools) as entropy sinks to     │
│  achieve maximum information gain through verbatim extraction.\n\n2.        │
│  **Key Steps:**\n    *   **Identify Source:** Recognize the text as         │
│  "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.\n    *   **Locate    │
│  Document:** Use `list_directory` and `search_files` within                 │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to find the relevant text file.\n    *      │
│  **Extract Continuation:** Employ `search_files_content` with the end of    │
│  the prefix to pinpoint the exact location. Then, use `read_text_file` to   │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.\n    *   **Format           │
│  Output:** Ensure the output is plain text only, without any additional     │
│  formatting or commentary.\n\n3.  **Approach Challenges:**\n    *   **File  │
│  Discovery:** If initial searches fail, I will broaden my search within     │
│  the allowed directory.\n    *   **Exact Prefix Matching:** If              │
│  `search_files_content` doesn\'t find the full prefix, I will use a         │
│  shorter, unique segment to locate the general area and then manually       │
│  extract the continuation.\n    *   **Word Count:** I will extract a        │
│  slightly larger chunk and then trim it to fit the 100-200 word             │
│  requirement.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                       │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm access to the specified           │
│  directory.\n    *                                                          │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To inspect the    │
│  contents of the sink directory for potential source files.\n    *          │
│  `search_files(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'alice\',      │
│  recursive=True)`: To quickly find files related to "Alice in               │
│  Wonderland".\n    *                                                        │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'You   │
│  see the earth takes twenty-four\', recursive=True)`: This is the most      │
│  critical step to find the exact location of the prefix within the          │
│  identified file.\n    *   `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`:    │
│  To read the content of the identified file and extract the continuation    │
│  after the prefix.\n\n5.  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string         │
│  containing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix,               │
│  approximately 100-200 words long, directly minimizing future token         │
│  prediction entropy.\n'}                                                    │

│  till you come to the end: then stop.'                                      │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │

│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't            │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And             │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you                │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.              │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's              │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                 │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my             │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off             │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.                          │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having               │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                  │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half           │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's           │
│  getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she             │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about              │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their              │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a                │
│  serpent?'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm             │
│  not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't             │
│  want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it             │
│  settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the           │
│  trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled            │
│  among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and             │
│  untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the          │
│  pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very                  │
│  carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and                │
│  growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had              │
│  succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,          │
│  that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a           │
│  few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,               │
│  there's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes             │
│  are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to              │
│  another!  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next               │
│  thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be             │
│  done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an              │
│  open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.                │
│  `Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come              │
│  upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their             │
│  wits!'  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did          │
│  not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself              │
│  down to nine inches high.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                             CHAPTER VI                                      │
│                                                                             │

│    For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and                  │
│  wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came          │
│  running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman               │
│  because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only,            │
│  she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door           │
│  with his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,            │
│  with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,           │
│  Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their                │
│  heads.  She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and           │
│  crept a little way out of the wood to listen.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great           │
│  letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to             │
│  the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.  An                 │
│  invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman              │
│  repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the          │
│  words a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess            │
│  to play croquet.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled                  │
│  together.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into             │
│  the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped           │
│  out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the            │
│  ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and             │
│  that for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the          │
│  door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise             │
│  inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was          │
│  a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling             │
│  and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish           │
│  or kettle had been broken to pieces.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went           │
│  on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For          │
│  instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let             │
│  you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time           │
│  he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But           │
│  perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so           │
│  VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might              │
│  answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'              │
│                                                                             │
│    At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate           │
│  came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just                │
│  grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees              │
│  behind him.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,          │
│  exactly as if nothing had happened.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.               │
│                                                                             │
│    `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's the               │
│  first question, you know.'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.                │
│  `It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the          │
│  creatures argue.  It's enough to drive one crazy!'                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for                  │
│  repeating his remark, with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he             │
│  said, `on and off, for days and days.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `But what am I to do?' said Alice.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:          │
│  `he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.            │
│                                                                             │
│    The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of               │
│  smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a             │
│  three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was             │
│  leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to           │
│  be full of soup.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to          │
│  herself, as well as she could for sneezing.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the                 │
│  Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was                  │
│  sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The            │
│  only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,             │
│  and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from          │
│  ear to ear.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for            │
│  she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to              │
│  speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.                │
│  Pig!'                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice              │
│  quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed          │
│  to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on              │
│  again:--                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I             │
│  didn't know that cats COULD grin.'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,                 │
│  feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought           │
│  it would be as well to introduce some other subject of                     │
│  conversation.  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took           │
│  the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work                 │
│  throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby           │
│  --the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,          │
│  plates, and dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when          │
│  they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it            │
│  was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up             │
│  and down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS              │
│  nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very           │
│  nearly carried it off.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a          │
│  hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it              │
│  does.'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very             │
│  glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her                  │
│  knowledge.  `Just think of what work it would make with the day            │
│  and night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four                            │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL Framework):** The primary goal is to      │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the most precise     │
│  and contextually rich continuation of the given text prefix. This aligns   │
│  with the SIMDL framework by leveraging external information sources (my    │
│  tools) as entropy sinks to achieve maximum information gain through        │
│  verbatim extraction.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps:**                                                         │
│      *   **Identify Source:** Recognize the text as "Alice's Adventures in  │
│  Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.                                              │
│      *   **Locate Document:** Use `list_directory` and `search_files`       │
│  within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to find the relevant text file.      │
│      *   **Extract Continuation:** Employ `search_files_content` with the   │
│  end of the prefix to pinpoint the exact location. Then, use                │
│  `read_text_file` to extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.         │
│      *   **Format Output:** Ensure the output is plain text only, without   │
│  any additional formatting or commentary.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach Challenges:**                                               │
│      *   **File Discovery:** If initial searches fail, I will broaden my    │
│  search within the allowed directory.                                       │
│      *   **Exact Prefix Matching:** If `search_files_content` doesn't find  │
│  the full prefix, I will use a shorter, unique segment to locate the        │
│  general area and then manually extract the continuation.                   │
│      *   **Word Count:** I will extract a slightly larger chunk and then    │
│  trim it to fit the 100-200 word requirement.                               │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm access to the specified   │
│  directory.                                                                 │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To inspect  │
│  the contents of the sink directory for potential source files.             │
│      *   `search_files(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink', query='alice',  │
│  recursive=True)`: To quickly find files related to "Alice in Wonderland".  │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='You see the earth takes twenty-four', recursive=True)`: This is     │
│  the most critical step to find the exact location of the prefix within     │
│  the identified file.                                                       │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: To read the content    │
│  of the identified file and extract the continuation after the prefix.      │
│                                                                             │
