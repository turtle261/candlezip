│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │

│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │
│   `unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.' `Who is   │
│  it directed to?' said one of the jurymen. `It isn't directed at all,'      │
│  said the White Rabbit; `in fact, there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  │
│  He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after     │
│  all: it's a set of verses.' `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?'      │
│  asked another of they jurymen. `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit,   │
│  `and that's the queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)   │
│  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury     │
│  all brightened up again.) `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I        │
│  didn't write it, and they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at     │
│  the end.' `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the     │
│  matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have        │
│  signed your name like an honest man.' There was a general clapping of      │
│  hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said      │
│  that day. `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen. `It proves nothing of   │
│  the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't even know what they're about!'      │
│  `Read them,' said the King. The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.        │
│  `Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he asked. `Begin at the        │
│  beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on till you come to the end:    │
│  then stop.' These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-- `They told me   │
│  you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good           │
│  character, But said I could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone     │
│  (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would      │
│  become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or     │
│  more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before. If  │
│  I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to  │
│  set them free, Exactly as we were. My notion was that you had been         │
│  (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and           │
│  ourselves, and it. Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must   │
│  ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.'        │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the    │
│  King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--' `If any one of them can   │
│  explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes   │
│  that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him          │
│  sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.' The jury    │
│  all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of    │
│  meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper. `If       │
│  there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a world of trouble,  │
│  you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,' he went    │
│  on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one     │
│  eye; `I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT   │
│  SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave. The      │
│  Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he        │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) `All right, so       │
│  far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself:  │
│  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE,   │
│  THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you     │
│  know--' `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said        │
│  Alice. `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the  │
│  tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then                │
│  again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?'  │
│  he said to the Queen. `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an       │
│  inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had      │
│  left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no      │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling    │
│  down his face, as long as it lasted.) `Then the words don't FIT you,'      │
│  said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead      │
│  silence. `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody   │
│  laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about   │
│  the twentieth time that day. `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence           │
│  first--verdict afterwards.' `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The  │
│  idea of having the sentence first!' `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen,    │
│  turning purple. `I won't!' said Alice. `Off with her head!' the Queen      │
│  shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. `Who cares for you?' said   │
│  Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) `You're nothing but  │
│  a pack of cards!' At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came    │
│  flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half    │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the       │
│  bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing      │
│  away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her      │
│  face. `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep      │
│  you've had!' `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she      │
│  told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange     │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she     │
│  had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream,    │
│  dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice  │
│  got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a      │
│  wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left     │
│  her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking  │
│  of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began       │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of  │
│  little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her  │
│  knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear  │
│  the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head    │
│  to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and   │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her     │
│  became alive the strange creatures of her little sister's dream. The long  │
│  grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened   │
│  Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the   │
│  rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their       │
│  never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her      │
│  unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on    │
│  the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more   │
│  the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil,     │
│  and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up    │
│  with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. So she sat on, with    │
│  closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she  │
│  had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the      │
│  grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the     │
│  waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-  │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and  │
│  the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all thy other       │
│  queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy  │
│  farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the   │
│  place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself     │
│  how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself   │
│  a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the    │
│  simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about   │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many  │
│  a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago:     │
│  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure  │
│  in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy    │
│  summer days. THE END                                                       │

│    `Why?' said the Caterpillar.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not               │
│  think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in           │
│  a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something          │
│  important to say!'                                                         │

│    This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back           │
│  again.                                                                     │

│    `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as          │
│  she could.                                                                 │

│                                                                             │
│    Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else            │
│  to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth             │
│  hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but            │
│  at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth             │
│  again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as          │
│  I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it          │
│  all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice folded her hands, and began:--                                     │
│                                                                             │
│      `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,                     │
│        `And your hair has become very white;                                │
│      And yet you incessantly stand on your head--                           │
│        Do you think, at your age, it is right?'                             │
│                                                                             │
│      `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,                      │
│        `I feared it might injure the brain;                                 │
│      But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,                          │
│        Why, I do it again and again.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│      `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,                 │
│        And have grown most uncommonly fat;                                  │
│      Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--                      │
│        Pray, what is the reason of that?'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│      `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,              │
│        `I kept all my limbs very supple                                     │
│      By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--                    │
│        Allow me to sell you a couple?'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│      `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak             │
│        For anything tougher than suet;                                      │
│      Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--              │
│        Pray how did you manage to do it?'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│      `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,                    │
│        And argued each case with my wife;                                   │
│      And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,                    │
│        Has lasted the rest of my life.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│      `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose               │
│        That your eye was as steady as ever;                                 │
│      Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--                      │
│        What made you so awfully clever?'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│      `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'                 │
│        Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!                          │
│      Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?                       │
│        Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the         │
│  words have got altered.'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar                │
│  decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The Caterpillar was the first to speak.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `What size do you want to be?' it asked.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;              │
│  `only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in          │
│  her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you                  │
│  wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched              │
│  height to be.'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar                  │
│  angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three          │
│  inches high).                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.          │
│  And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so           │
│  easily offended!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it            │
│  put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.          │
│  In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its              │
│  mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got             │
│  down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely               │
│  remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and             │
│  the other side will make you grow shorter.'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to            │
│  herself.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had              │
│  asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a                │
│  minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as          │
│  it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.          │
│  However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they            │
│  would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a             │
│  little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment           │
│  she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her            │
│  foot!                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but           │
│  she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking           │
│  rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.          │
│  Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was           │
│  hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and                 │
│  managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.                           │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                     │
│                                                                             │
│           *       *       *       *       *       *                         │
│                                                                             │
│       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of                  │
│  delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she              │
│  found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could          │
│  see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which            │
│  seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay          │
│  far below her.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.  `And where              │
│  HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I              │
│  can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no            │
│  result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the                 │
│  distant green leaves.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her           │
│  head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted            │
│  to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,            │
│  like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a          │
│  graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which          │
│  she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she          │
│  had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a              │
│  hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating            │
│  her violently with its wings.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more               │
│  subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every              │
│  way, and nothing seems to suit them!'                                      │
│                                                                             │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
