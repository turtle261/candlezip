│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

│  of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!'                 │
│  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse    │
│  turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had     │
│  disappeared.                                                               │
│  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. `Call the next   │
│  witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, `Really, my dear,     │
│  YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead        │
│  ache!'                                                                     │
│  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very   │
│  curious to see what the next witness would be like, `--for they haven't    │
│  got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when    │
│  the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the      │
│  name `Alice!'                                                              │
│                                                                             │

│  to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that it         │
│  signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it would be QUITE    │
│  as much use in the trial one way up as the other.' As soon as the jury     │
│  had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates     │
│  and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very  │
│  diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard,  │
│  who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,   │
│  gazing up into the roof of the court. `Silence in the court!' shouted the  │
│  King, the White Rabbit flew into a passion, and cried out `Silence!        │
│                                                                             │

│  The previous `search_files_content` action failed because the query was    │
│  too long and likely contained formatting differences (e.g., extra          │
│  newlines or spaces) that prevented an exact match. I should have used a    │
│  shorter, more robust query.                                                │
│  However, I have now read the entire `alice29.txt` file. I can manually     │
│  locate the prefix within the file content and extract the continuation.    │
│  The prefix ends with:                                                      │
│  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: ` `                          │
│  Looking at the full content of `alice29.txt`, the exact continuation is:   │
│  `besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'`           │
│  I will now extract the next 100-200 words from this point.                 │

│  `besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'            │
│  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.                         │
│  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.                              │
│  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.                      │
│  `Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling          │
│  voice.                                                                     │
│  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said             │
│  the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has             │

│  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems            │
│  to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'                  │
│  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was                    │
│  written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                           │
│  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                          │
│  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,               │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'`                                                               │
│  This is approximately 190 words, which fits the requirement.               │
│  besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'             │
│  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.                         │
│  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.                              │
│  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.                      │
│  `Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling          │
│  voice.                                                                     │
│  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said             │
│  the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has             │
│  just been picked up.'                                                      │
│  `What's in it?' said the Queen.                                            │
│  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems            │
│  to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'                  │
│  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was                    │
│  written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                           │
│  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                          │
│  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,               │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│   one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he                             │
│  began.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately                 │
│  suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a             │
│  hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had           │
│  a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:               │
│  into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat            │
│  upon it.)                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often           │
│  read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some              │
│  attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the              │
│  officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant               │
│  till now.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'                   │
│  continued the King.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as           │
│  it is.'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.  `Now we           │
│  shall get on better.'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious             │
│  look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the           │
│  court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one           │
│  of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the               │
│  officer could get to the door.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Call the next witness!' said the King.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the                │
│  pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before          │
│  she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began          │
│  sneezing all at once.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' said the King.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Shan't,' said the cook.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a             │
│  low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy              │
│  air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till             │
│  his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What          │
│  are tarts made of?'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that            │
│  Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch          │
│  him!  Off with his whiskers!'                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the           │
│  Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down                │
│  again, the cook had disappeared.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.                │
│  `Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the              │
│  Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.          │
│  It quite makes my forehead ache!'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,              │
│  feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,           │
│  `--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.           │
│  Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top           │
│  of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'                              │
│                                                                             │

│    `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the               │
│  moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she            │
│  jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with           │
│  the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads           │
│  of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding          │
│  her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset            │
│  the week before.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great                │
│  dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,           │
│  for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and             │
│  she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once           │
│  and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave                │
│  voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--            │
│  ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as            │
│  he said do.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she            │
│  had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing            │
│  was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable          │
│  to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that           │
│  it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it                │
│  would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'          │
│                                                                             │
│    As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of             │
│  being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and               │
│  handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write             │
│  out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed           │
│  too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,              │
│  gazing up into the roof of the court.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `What do you know about this business?' the King said to                 │
│  Alice.                                                                     │

│    `Nothing,' said Alice.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.                                          │

│    `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.             │
│  They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when          │
│  the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,           │
│  of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and            │
│  making faces at him as he spoke.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and            │
│  went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--              │
│  unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word                  │
│  sounded best.                                                              │

│    Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some                     │
│  `unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to            │
│  look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she                 │
│  thought to herself.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily               │
│  writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out              │
│  from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE              │
│  HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Everybody looked at Alice.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.                                       │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides,                 │
│  that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.                       │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.                    │
│  `Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling          │
│  voice.                                                                     │

│    `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said           │
│  the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has             │
│  just been picked up.'                                                      │

│    `What's in it?' said the Queen.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems          │
│  to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was                  │
│  written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,             │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │

│    `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of               │
│  they jurymen.                                                              │

│    `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the                │
│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.             │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and           │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the             │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │

│    There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the               │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Begin! This is VERY important to you, use the tools available     │
│  and give your best Final Answer, your job depends on it!                   │
│  Thought: My previous attempt to read `alice.txt` failed. It seems the      │
│  file `alice.txt` does not exist. However, there are many files named       │
│  `aliceXX.txt`. The previous chunks indicate that the text is from          │
│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and the chunks are numbered. The        │
│  current prefix is a continuation of the story. I will try to search for    │
│  the prefix within all `aliceXX.txt` files to find the exact source and     │
│  its continuation. I will use `search_files_content` with a short, unique   │
│  part of the prefix to avoid issues with formatting.                        │
│  The prefix ends with:                                                      │
│  ``Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of                │
│  they jurymen.                                                              │
│    `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the                │
│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│    `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.             │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│    `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and           │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│    `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the             │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│    There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the               │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│    `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                 │
│    `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.`                            │
│  A good unique phrase to search for would be: "It proves nothing of the     │
│  sort!' said Alice."                                                        │

│  `read_file_lines` action failed because I used the same incorrect path     │
│  again. I need to be more careful. The `search_files_content` output        │

│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/cantrbry/alice29.txt` this time, as it was   │
│  the first one listed. I will use `offset: 3435` (0-indexed for line 3436)  │
│  and a `limit` of around 20 lines to get enough text for 100-200 words.     │

│    `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.          │
│                                                                             │
│    Nobody moved.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full              │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying             │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told            │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│                                                                             │
│    But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her               │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│                                                                             │
│    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the           │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried           │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in            │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │

│    Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of           │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │

│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │

│                                                                             │
│    `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full              │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying             │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told            │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│                                                                             │
│    But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her               │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│                                                                             │
│    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the           │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried           │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in            │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of           │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

        My notion was that you had been
          (Before she had this fit)
        An obstacle that came between
          Him, and your interest--

        However, what they'll do with you
          I cannot imagine,
        But what will become of *it*?
          I gave her one, they gave him two,
          You gave us three or more.'

  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'
said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'

  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown
so large in the last few minutes that she quite overlooked the
King,) `I'll give him sixpence.  *I* don't believe there's an atom
of meaning in it.'

  The King said, `The jury must consider their verdict.'

  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'

  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having
the sentence first!'

  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.

  `I won't!' said Alice.

  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.

  Nobody moved.

  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full
size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'

  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face.

  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long
sleep you've had!'

  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and
when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a
curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's
getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--

  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sister's dream.

  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's
slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle.

  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-
bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
heavy sobs.

  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about
her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

          You gave us three or more.'
