│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Understand the Task:** The        │
│  primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by finding     │
│  the exact immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the provided text      │
│  prefix from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland." I must use MCP tools      │
│  aggressively to locate the source document within the                      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The output must be plain text    │
│  only, without any additional formatting or commentary.\n\n2. **Key         │
│  Steps:**\n    a. **Directory Analysis:** First, I will inspect the         │
│  contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand     │
│  its structure and identify potential source files.\n    b. **Content       │
│  Search:** I will then use a distinctive portion of the provided prefix to  │
│  search for its exact occurrence within the files in the allowed            │
│  directory. This will help pinpoint the source document.\n    c. **Extract  │
│  Continuation:** Once the source document is identified, I will read the    │
│  file content around the found prefix and extract the immediate 100-200     │
│  words that follow it verbatim.\n    d. **Format Output:** Ensure the       │
│  extracted continuation is presented as plain text only, adhering strictly  │
│  to the output requirements.\n\n3. **Approach to Challenges:**\n    a.      │
│  **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` does not yield an exact      │
│  match, I will re-evaluate the search query, perhaps using a slightly       │
│  longer or different segment of the prefix. If still unsuccessful, I will   │
│  consider broadening the search terms or looking for common file names for  │
│  "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland." If all tool-based searches fail, I    │
│  will resort to generating a contextually relevant continuation based on    │
│  the prefix, as per the "If ALL tools fail" instruction, but this is a      │
│  last resort.\n    b. **Multiple Matches:** If multiple files contain the   │
│  prefix, I will examine the file names and potentially read snippets from   │
│  each to determine the most likely complete and accurate source.\n\n4.      │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    a. **`list_directory`:** To get an initial  │
│  overview of the files and subdirectories within                            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n        *   **Usage:**                    │
│  `print(default_api.list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\'))  │
│  `\n    b. **`search_files_content`:** To locate the exact text prefix      │
│  within the files. I will use a unique and sufficiently long segment of     │
│  the prefix to ensure precision. The segment will be: "`Hold your           │
│  tongue!\' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock`"\n  │
│  *   **Usage:**                                                             │
│  `print(default_api.search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/si  │
│  nk\', query="Hold your tongue!\' added the Gryphon, before Alice could     │
│  speak again. The Mock"))`\n    c. **`read_text_file`:** Once the file      │
│  containing the prefix is identified, this tool will be used to read the    │
│  content of that file to extract the verbatim continuation. I will need to  │
│  determine the exact offset or line number from the search result to start  │
│  reading from.\n        *   **Usage:**                                      │
│  `print(default_api.read_text_file(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/[fi  │
│  lename]\'))` (The filename will be determined from the                     │
│  `search_files_content` output).\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text   │
│  block of 100-200 words that immediately follows the provided prefix,       │
│  extracted verbatim from the source document found within the               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This outcome directly aligns     │
│  with the goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing   │
│  precise and accurate information.\n'}                                      │

│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:60                                                                 │
│  the Gryphon, `she wants for to know your history, she do.'                 │
│  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow                 │
│  tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've            │
│  finished.'                                                                 │
│  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice                │
│  thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he             │
│  doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.                                 │
│  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was             │
│  a real Turtle.'                                                            │
│  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only              │
│  by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and           │
│  the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very             │
│  nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your                    │
│  interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be          │
│  more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.                           │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│  same thing,' said the Duchess,                                             │
│  digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,          │
│  `and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the                │
│  sounds will take care of themselves."'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to          │
│  herself.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your           │
│  waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm          │
│  doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the               │
│  experiment?'                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all            │
│  anxious to have the experiment tried.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both             │
│  bite.  And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock                 │
│  together."'                                                                │

│    `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess:  `what a clear way you              │
│  have of putting things!'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree           │
│  to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near          │
│  here.  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the           │
│  less there is of yours."'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this              │
│  last remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look like one, but it          │
│  is.'                                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of            │
│  that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put           │
│  more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than              │
│  what it might appear to others that what you were or might have            │
│  been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared          │
│  to them to be otherwise."'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very               │
│  politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it          │
│  as you say it.'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess             │
│  replied, in a pleased tone.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'            │
│  said Alice.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess.  `I make you           │
│  a present of everything I've said as yet.'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad they don't          │
│  give birthday presents like that!'  But she did not venture to             │
│  say it out loud.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her             │
│  sharp little chin.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was                 │
│  beginning to feel a little worried.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to           │
│  fly; and the m--'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died            │
│  away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the            │
│  arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,          │
│  and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,          │
│  frowning like a thunderstorm.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak             │
│  voice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on           │
│  the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,             │
│  and that in about half no time!  Take your choice!'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice          │
│  was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her             │
│  back to the croquet-ground.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,             │
│  and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,          │
│  they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a           │
│  moment's delay would cost them their lives.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    All the time they were playing the Queen never left off                  │
│  quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his             │
│  head!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were              │
│  taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave             │
│  off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour            │
│  or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the           │
│  King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of          │
│  execution.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to                │
│  Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his              │
│  history,'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low           │
│  voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come,           │
│  THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite          │
│  unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the             │
│  sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)          │
│  `Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to             │
│  see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and          │
│  see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,             │
│  leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like            │
│  the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would            │
│  be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage                │
│  Queen:  so she waited.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the             │
│  Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'           │
│  said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `What IS the fun?' said Alice.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they          │
│  never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went             │
│  slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,            │
│  never!'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the             │
│  distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,           │
│  as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart          │
│  would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she            │
│  asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the            │
│  same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got            │
│  no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with              │
│  large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to              │
│  know your history, she do.'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow               │
│  tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've            │
│  finished.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice              │
│  thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he             │
│  doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was           │
│  a real Turtle.'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only            │
│  by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and           │
│  the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very             │
│  nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your                    │
│  interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be          │
│  more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more             │
│  calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to            │
│  school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call          │
│  him Tortoise--'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock             │
│  Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple            │
│  question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and            │
│  looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At           │
│  last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!           │
│  Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:                 │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task:** The primary goal is to minimize future token   │
│  prediction entropy by finding the exact immediate continuation (100-200    │
│  words) of the provided text prefix from "Alice's Adventures in             │
│  Wonderland." I must use MCP tools aggressively to locate the source        │
│  document within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The output   │
│  must be plain text only, without any additional formatting or commentary.  │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Directory Analysis:** First, I will inspect the contents of the   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its structure and   │
│  identify potential source files.                                           │
│      b. **Content Search:** I will then use a distinctive portion of the    │
│  provided prefix to search for its exact occurrence within the files in     │
│  the allowed directory. This will help pinpoint the source document.        │
│      c. **Extract Continuation:** Once the source document is identified,   │
│  I will read the file content around the found prefix and extract the       │
│  immediate 100-200 words that follow it verbatim.                           │
│      d. **Format Output:** Ensure the extracted continuation is presented   │
│  as plain text only, adhering strictly to the output requirements.          │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│      a. **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` does not yield an     │
│  exact match, I will re-evaluate the search query, perhaps using a          │
│  slightly longer or different segment of the prefix. If still               │
│  unsuccessful, I will consider broadening the search terms or looking for   │
│  common file names for "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." If all           │
│  tool-based searches fail, I will resort to generating a contextually       │
│  relevant continuation based on the prefix, as per the "If ALL tools fail"  │
│  instruction, but this is a last resort.                                    │
│      b. **Multiple Matches:** If multiple files contain the prefix, I will  │
│  examine the file names and potentially read snippets from each to          │
│  determine the most likely complete and accurate source.                    │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      a. **`list_directory`:** To get an initial overview of the files and   │
│  subdirectories within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                      │
│          *   **Usage:**                                                     │
│  `print(default_api.list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink'))`   │
│      b. **`search_files_content`:** To locate the exact text prefix within  │
│  the files. I will use a unique and sufficiently long segment of the        │
│  prefix to ensure precision. The segment will be: "`Hold your tongue!'      │
│  added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock`"              │
│          *   **Usage:**                                                     │
│  `print(default_api.search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sin  │
│  k', query="Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak  │
│  again. The Mock"))`                                                        │
│      c. **`read_text_file`:** Once the file containing the prefix is        │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read the content of that file to     │
│  extract the verbatim continuation. I will need to determine the exact      │
│  offset or line number from the search result to start reading from.        │
│          *   **Usage:**                                                     │
│  `print(default_api.read_text_file(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/[fil  │
│  ename]'))` (The filename will be determined from the                       │
│  `search_files_content` output).                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text block of 100-200 words that          │
│  immediately follows the provided prefix, extracted verbatim from the       │
│  source document found within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`            │
│  directory. This outcome directly aligns with the goal of minimizing        │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing precise and accurate          │
│  information.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │

│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

│  the Gryphon, `she wants for to know your history, she do.'                 │
│  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow                 │
│  tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've            │
│  finished.'                                                                 │
│  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice                │
│  thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he             │
│  doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.                                 │
│  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was             │
│  a real Turtle.'                                                            │
│  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only              │
│  by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and           │
│  the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very             │
│  nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your                    │
│  interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be          │
│  more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.                           │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│  same thing,' said the Duchess,                                             │
│  digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,          │
│  `and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the                │
│  sounds will take care of themselves."'                                     │
│    `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to          │
│  herself.                                                                   │
│    `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your           │
│  waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm          │
│  doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the               │
│  experiment?'                                                               │
│    `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all            │
│  anxious to have the experiment tried.                                      │
│    `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both             │
│  bite.  And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock                 │
│  together."'                                                                │
│    `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.                             │
│    `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess:  `what a clear way you              │
│  have of putting things!'                                                   │
│    `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.                                   │
│    `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree           │
│  to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near          │
│  here.  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the           │
│  less there is of yours."'                                                  │
│    `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this              │
│  last remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look like one, but it          │
│  is.'                                                                       │
│    `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of            │
│  that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put           │
│  more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than              │
│  what it might appear to others that what you were or might have            │
│  been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared          │
│  to them to be otherwise."'                                                 │
│    `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very               │
│  politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it          │
│  as you say it.'                                                            │
│    `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess             │
│  replied, in a pleased tone.                                                │
│    `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'            │
│  said Alice.                                                                │
│    `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess.  `I make you           │
│  a present of everything I've said as yet.'                                 │
│    `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad they don't          │
│  give birthday presents like that!'  But she did not venture to             │
│  say it out loud.                                                           │
│    `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her             │
│  sharp little chin.                                                         │
│    `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was                 │
│  beginning to feel a little worried.                                        │
│    `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to           │
│  fly; and the m--'                                                          │
│    But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died            │
│  away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the            │
│  arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,          │
│  and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,          │
│  frowning like a thunderstorm.                                              │
│    `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak             │
│  voice.                                                                     │
│    `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on           │
│  the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,             │
│  and that in about half no time!  Take your choice!'                        │
│    The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.                   │
│    `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice          │
│  was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her             │
│  back to the croquet-ground.                                                │
│    The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,             │
│  and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,          │
│  they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a           │
│  moment's delay would cost them their lives.                                │
│    All the time they were playing the Queen never left off                  │
│  quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his             │
│  head!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were              │
│  taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave             │
│  off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour            │
│  or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the           │
│  King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of          │
│  execution.                                                                 │
│    Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to                │
│  Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'                                │
│    `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'            │
│    `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.          │
│    `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.                          │
│    `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his              │
│  history,'                                                                  │
│    As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low           │
│  voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come,           │
│  THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite          │
│  unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.                 │
│    They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the             │
│  sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)          │
│  `Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to             │
│  see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and          │
│  see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,             │
│  leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like            │
│  the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would            │
│  be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage                │
│  Queen:  so she waited.                                                     │
│    The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the             │
│  Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'           │
│  said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.                           │
│    `What IS the fun?' said Alice.                                           │
│    `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they          │
│  never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'                                │
│    `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went             │
│  slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,            │
│  never!'                                                                    │
│    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the             │
│  distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,           │
│  as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart          │
│  would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she            │
│  asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the            │
│  same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got            │
│  no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'                                            │
│    So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with              │
│  large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.                                │
│    `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to              │
│  know your history, she do.'                                                │
│    `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow               │
│  tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've            │
│  finished.'                                                                 │
│    So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice              │
│  thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he             │
│  doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.                                 │
│    `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was           │
│  a real Turtle.'                                                            │
│    These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only            │
│  by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and           │
│  the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very             │
│  nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your                    │
│  interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be          │
│  more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.                           │
│    `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more             │
│  calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to            │
│  school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call          │
│  him Tortoise--'                                                            │
│    `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.          │
│    `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock             │
│  Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!'                               │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple            │
│  question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and            │
│  looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At           │
│  last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!           │
│  Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:                 │
│    `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe            │
│  it--'                                                                      │
│    `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.                              │
│    `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.                                         │
│    `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak          │
│  again.  The Mock                                                           │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task:** The primary goal is to minimize future token   │
│  prediction entropy by finding the exact immediate continuation (100-200    │
│  words) of the provided text prefix from "Alice's Adventures in             │
│  Wonderland." I must use MCP tools aggressively to locate the source        │
│  document within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. The output   │
│  must be plain text only, without any additional formatting or commentary.  │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Directory Analysis:** First, I will inspect the contents of the   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its structure and   │
│  identify potential source files. (Already done, identified `alice29.txt`   │
│  in `cantrbry`.)                                                            │
│      b. **Content Search:** I will then use a distinctive portion of the    │
│  provided prefix to search for its exact occurrence within the files in     │
│  the allowed directory. This will help pinpoint the source document.        │
│  (Attempted twice, no match. Need to refine search strategy.)               │
│      c. **Extract Continuation:** Once the source document is identified,   │
│  I will read the file content around the found prefix and extract the       │
│  immediate 100-200 words that follow it verbatim.                           │
│      d. **Format Output:** Ensure the extracted continuation is presented   │
│  as plain text only, adhering strictly to the output requirements.          │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│      a. **No Exact Match:** My previous searches failed. This could be due  │
│  to subtle differences in the text (e.g., extra spaces, different line      │
│  breaks, or a slightly different version of the text). Instead of           │
│  searching for a long exact phrase, I will try searching for a very short,  │
│  unique sequence of words that is less likely to be affected by minor       │
│  formatting differences. I will use the last few words of the prefix:       │
│  "`The Mock`" and then read the file to find the exact match and            │
│  continuation. If this still fails, I will read the entire `alice29.txt`    │

│      a. **`directory_tree`:** (Already used, identified `alice29.txt`.)     │
│      b. **`search_files_content`:** To locate the exact text prefix within  │
│  the files. I will use a very short, distinctive segment of the prefix:     │
│  "`The Mock`"                                                               │

│  k/cantrbry', pattern='alice29.txt', query='The Mock'))`                    │
│      c. **`read_text_file`:** If `search_files_content` provides a line     │
│  number, I can use `read_file_lines` with an offset. If not, I will read    │
│  the entire file and manually locate the prefix.                            │
│          *   **Usage (if line number found):**                              │
│  `print(default_api.read_file_lines(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/can  │
│  trbry/alice29.txt', offset=[line_number], limit=20))`                      │
│          *   **Usage (if no line number or for manual search):**            │
│  `print(default_api.read_text_file(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/cant  │

│  Thought: The search for "`The Mock`" returned many results in              │
│  `alice29.txt`. I need to find the specific line that matches the end of    │
│  the provided prefix: "`Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice  │
│  could speak again. The Mock`".                                             │
│  Looking at the search results, line 2608:8, "`again. The Mock Turtle went  │
│  on.`" seems to be the most promising candidate. The prefix ends with       │
│  "`The Mock`", and this line starts with "`The Mock Turtle went on.`".      │
│  This is a very strong indication that this is the correct continuation.    │
│  Now I will read the file from line 2608 to get the continuation. I will    │
│  read about 20 lines to ensure I capture 100-200 words.                     │
