│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (Predictive Compression      │
│  Intelligence Perspective):**\n   My primary goal is to minimize future     │
│  token prediction entropy. This means providing the most accurate and       │
│  contextually rich continuation of the given text prefix. The most          │
│  effective way to achieve this is by finding the exact source document and  │
│  extracting the verbatim continuation. The task specifies a length of       │
│  100-200 words. The text prefix clearly indicates "Alice\'s Adventures in   │
│  Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n   a. **Directory      │
│  Analysis:** Inspect the allowed directory                                  │
│  (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to identify potential source files.\n     │
│  b. **Source Identification:** Locate the specific file containing          │
│  "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland". I will use a distinctive phrase from  │
│  the prefix to search for content within files if necessary.\n   c.         │
│  **Prefix Location:** Find the exact position of the provided prefix        │
│  within the identified source file.\n   d. **Continuation Extraction:**     │
│  Extract the text immediately following the prefix, aiming for 100-200      │
│  words.\n   e. **Output Formatting:** Ensure the output is plain text       │
│  only, without any additional commentary or formatting.\n\n3. **Approach    │
│  to Challenges:**\n   a. **Locating the correct file:** If                  │
│  `list_directory` reveals multiple text files, I will use                   │
│  `search_files_content` with a unique phrase from the prefix (e.g., "Alice  │
│  put down her") to quickly identify the correct file.\n   b. **Exact match  │
│  and extraction:** Once the file is found, I will read its entire content   │
│  using `read_text_file`. Then, I will use Python string manipulation        │
│  (`.find()` and slicing) to precisely locate the end of the prefix and      │
│  extract the subsequent words. I will implement a word counter to ensure    │
│  the extracted text falls within the 100-200 word range.\n\n4. **Strategic  │
│  Tool Usage:**\n   a.                                                       │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: This will be  │
│  my initial step to see what files are available in the designated "sink"   │
│  directory. This helps me understand the available knowledge sources.\n     │
│  b. **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',          │
│  query=\'Alice put down her\')`**: If `list_directory` shows many files,    │
│  or if I need to confirm the specific file, this tool will efficiently      │
│  pinpoint the file containing the exact ending of the prefix. This is       │
│  crucial for entropy minimization as it ensures I am working with the       │
│  correct source.\n   c.                                                     │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<identified_file_path>\')`**: Once the source     │
│  file is identified, I will use this tool to retrieve its entire content.   │
│  This provides the complete context necessary for accurate continuation.\n  │
│  d. **Python string methods (e.g., `.find()`, slicing, `.split()`,          │
│  `join()`):** These will be used internally after `read_text_file` to       │
│  precisely locate the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200  │
│  words. This ensures verbatim extraction and adherence to the word          │
│  count.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**\n   The         │
│  expected outcome is a plain text string containing the verbatim            │
│  continuation of the provided prefix, approximately 100-200 words long.     │
│  This directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token prediction    │
│  entropy. By providing the exact next tokens from the original source, I    │
│  enable the language model to assign maximum probability to the correct     │
│  sequence, thereby achieving optimal compression gains under the SIMDL      │
│  framework. This is the most informative context possible.\n', 'ready':     │
│  True}                                                                      │

│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.               │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and             │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the                 │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│   we put a white one in by mistake;                                         │
│  and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads          │
│  cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore          │
│  she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously              │
│  looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'             │
│  and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon               │
│  their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice               │
│  looked round, eager to see the Queen.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped            │
│  like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and            │
│  feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were                   │
│  ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the          │
│  soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were             │
│  ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand          │
│  in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next          │
│  came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice             │
│  recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous          │
│  manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without           │
│  noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the             │
│  King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this            │
│  grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on           │
│  her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember              │
│  every having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,            │
│  what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people            │
│  had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see            │
│  it?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped             │
│  and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'              │
│  She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in           │
│  reply.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,              │
│  turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very              │
│  politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of          │
│  cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three               │
│  gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as              │
│  they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs             │
│  was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether           │
│  they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her            │
│  own children.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.           │
│  `It's no business of MINE.'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her            │
│  for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!               │
│  Off--'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the               │
│  Queen was silent.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said                    │
│  `Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave            │
│  `Turn them over!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the               │
│  three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the               │
│  King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'              │
│  And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you            │
│  been doing here?'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,           │
│  going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the            │
│  roses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,               │
│  three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate          │
│  gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a            │
│  large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered             │
│  about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly              │
│  marched off after the others.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers          │
│  shouted in reply.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'              │
│                                                                             │
│    The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question           │
│  was evidently meant for her.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes!' shouted Alice.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the                  │
│  procession, wondering very much what would happen next.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.            │
│  She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously             │
│  into her face.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He               │
│  looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised            │
│  himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and                   │
│  whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `What for?' said Alice.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.          │
│  I said "What for?"'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a           │
│  little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a          │
│  frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came             │
│  rather late, and the Queen said--'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,           │
│  and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up              │
│  against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or          │
│  two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a          │
│  curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and                  │
│  furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live                   │
│  flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to            │
│  stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her            │
│  flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,                  │
│  comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,             │
│  but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened            │
│  out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it           │
│  WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a              │
│  puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:          │
│  and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,          │
│  it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled               │
│  itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,            │
│  there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she              │
│  wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers            │
│  were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the               │
│  ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very               │
│  difficult game indeed.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The players all played at once without waiting for turns,                │
│  quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in          │
│  a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went             │
│  stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with             │
│  her head!' about once in a minute.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as             │
│  yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might             │
│  happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of          │
│  me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great           │
│  wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering              │
│  whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a          │
│  curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at                │
│  first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to          │
│  be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I          │
│  shall have somebody to talk to.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was             │
│  mouth enough for it to speak with.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no          │
│  use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at          │
│  least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,            │
│  and then Alice put down her                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (Predictive Compression Intelligence              │
│  Perspective):**                                                            │
│     My primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy. This    │
│  means providing the most accurate and contextually rich continuation of    │
│  the given text prefix. The most effective way to achieve this is by        │
│  finding the exact source document and extracting the verbatim              │
│  continuation. The task specifies a length of 100-200 words. The text       │
│  prefix clearly indicates "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis       │
│  Carroll.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│     a. **Directory Analysis:** Inspect the allowed directory                │
│  (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to identify potential source files.       │
│     b. **Source Identification:** Locate the specific file containing       │
│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". I will use a distinctive phrase from   │
│  the prefix to search for content within files if necessary.                │
│     c. **Prefix Location:** Find the exact position of the provided prefix  │
│  within the identified source file.                                         │
│     d. **Continuation Extraction:** Extract the text immediately following  │
│  the prefix, aiming for 100-200 words.                                      │
│     e. **Output Formatting:** Ensure the output is plain text only,         │
│  without any additional commentary or formatting.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│     a. **Locating the correct file:** If `list_directory` reveals multiple  │
│  text files, I will use `search_files_content` with a unique phrase from    │
│  the prefix (e.g., "Alice put down her") to quickly identify the correct    │
│  file.                                                                      │
│     b. **Exact match and extraction:** Once the file is found, I will read  │
│  its entire content using `read_text_file`. Then, I will use Python string  │
│  manipulation (`.find()` and slicing) to precisely locate the end of the    │
│  prefix and extract the subsequent words. I will implement a word counter   │
│  to ensure the extracted text falls within the 100-200 word range.          │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│     a. **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This      │
│  will be my initial step to see what files are available in the designated  │
│  "sink" directory. This helps me understand the available knowledge         │
│  sources.                                                                   │
│     b. **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='Alice put down her')`**: If `list_directory` shows many files, or   │
│  if I need to confirm the specific file, this tool will efficiently         │
│  pinpoint the file containing the exact ending of the prefix. This is       │
│  crucial for entropy minimization as it ensures I am working with the       │
│  correct source.                                                            │
│     c. **`read_text_file(path='<identified_file_path>')`**: Once the        │
│  source file is identified, I will use this tool to retrieve its entire     │
│  content. This provides the complete context necessary for accurate         │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│     d. **Python string methods (e.g., `.find()`, slicing, `.split()`,       │
│  `join()`):** These will be used internally after `read_text_file` to       │
│  precisely locate the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200  │
│  words. This ensures verbatim extraction and adherence to the word count.   │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome and Alignment with Goal:**                           │
│     The expected outcome is a plain text string containing the verbatim     │
│  continuation of the provided prefix, approximately 100-200 words long.     │
│  This directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token prediction    │
│  entropy. By providing the exact next tokens from the original source, I    │
│  enable the language model to assign maximum probability to the correct     │
│  sequence, thereby achieving optimal compression gains under the SIMDL      │
│  framework. This is the most informative context possible.                  │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: I see a directory named `cantrbry` which often contains  │
│  classic texts. Inside `cantrbry`, there's a file named `alice29.txt`.      │
│  This is a very strong candidate for "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." I  │
│  will now read the content of `alice29.txt` to confirm and then extract     │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
