│  sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'             │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe there's an   │
│  atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.   │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a world of       │
│  trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'   │
│  he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them      │
│  with one eye; `I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I    │
│  COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the       │
│  Knave.                                                                     │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he    │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)                      │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the      │
│  verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of          │
│  course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he   │
│  did with the tarts, you know--'                                            │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.         │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts   │
│  on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE   │
│  HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the      │
│  Queen.                                                                     │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as   │
│  she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate  │
│  with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began     │
│  again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it      │
│  lasted.)                                                                   │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court     │
│  with a smile. There was a dead silence.                                    │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,   │
│  `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the        │
│  twentieth time that day.                                                   │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having the sentence  │
│  first!'                                                                    │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody     │
│  moved.                                                                     │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this   │
│  time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                               │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon     │
│  her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and       │
│  tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her      │
│  head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead      │
│  leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.               │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep you've     │
│  had!'                                                                      │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister,  │
│  as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers   │
│  that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her      │
│  sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly:     │
│  but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran    │
│  off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it  │
│  had been.                                                                  │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her     │
│  hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her   │
│  wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and     │
│  this was her dream:--                                                      │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands  │
│  were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up      │
│  into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer  │
│  little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always  │
│  get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the     │
│  whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little    │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the     │
│  frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she       │
│  could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends     │
│  shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen          │
│  ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby   │
│  was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed        │
│  around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the       │
│  Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,      │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock       │
│  Turtle.                                                                    │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,  │
│  though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to    │
│  dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool   │
│  rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to  │
│  tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the     │
│  shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and   │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused        │
│  clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the       │
│  distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.             │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers        │
│  would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would      │
│  keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her      │
│  childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and   │
│  make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even    │
│  with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all  │
│  their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,        │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

│  chorus, `Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently,   │
│  and walked a little quicker.                                               │
│  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it             │
│  was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of            │
│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you          │
│  never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the              │
│  young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the                │
│  patience of an oyster!'                                                    │
│  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,              │
│  addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'              │
│  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'                │
│  said the Lory.                                                             │
│  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about              │
│  her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for              │
│  catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her           │
│  after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look            │
│  at it!'                                                                    │
│  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.                 │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began           │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts          │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │
│                                                                             │

│  Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.       │

│  The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill                                          │
│  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                   │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!           │
│  Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me                   │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have                │

│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │

│  its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,           │
│  in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.  At             │

│  prizes.'                                                                   │

│    `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices                │
│  asked.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with             │
│  one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,                 │
│  calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand            │
│  in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt          │
│  water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.               │
│  There was exactly one a-piece all round.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have             │
│  you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo                │
│  solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of          │
│  this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short                │
│  speech, they all cheered.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked           │
│  so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not             │
│  think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,          │
│  looking as solemn as she could.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise           │
│  and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not           │
│  taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on            │
│  the back.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again           │
│  in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.               │
│                                                                             │
│    `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,            │
│  `and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half            │
│  afraid that it would be offended again.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to              │
│  Alice, and sighing.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with            │
│  wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?'  And             │
│  she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so             │
│  that her idea of the tale was something like this:--                       │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │

│  quicker.                                                                   │

│    `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it           │

│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you          │
│  never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the              │
│  young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the                │
│  patience of an oyster!'                                                    │

│    `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,            │
│  addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'              │
│                                                                             │
│    `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'              │
│  said the Lory.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about            │
│  her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for              │
│  catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her           │
│  after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look            │
│  at it!'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.               │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began           │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts          │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a              │
│  melancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm            │
│  sure she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I               │
│  wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice             │
│  began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.             │
│  In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of          │
│  footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping          │
│  that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to                │
│  finish his story.                                                          │

│    It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                 │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!           │
│  Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me                   │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have                │
│  dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was            │
│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │
│  the little door, had vanished completely.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,           │
│  and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE           │
│  you doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of          │
│  gloves and a fan!  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened          │
│  that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without           │
│  trying to explain the mistake it had made.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.          │
│  `How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!  But I'd               │
│  better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'          │
│  As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door           │
│  of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'                │
│  engraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried               │
│  upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,            │
│  and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and            │
│  gloves.                                                                    │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │

│  its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,           │
│  in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At              │
│  last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have                  │
│  prizes.'                                                                   │

│  `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices                  │
│  asked.                                                                     │

│  `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with               │
│  one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,                 │
│  calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'                           │
│                                                                             │
│  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand              │
│  in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt          │
│  water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.               │
│  There was exactly one a-piece all round.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.             │
│                                                                             │
│  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have                │
│  you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo                  │
│  solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of          │
│  this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short                │
│  speech, they all cheered.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked             │
│  so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not             │
│  think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,          │
│  looking as solemn as she could.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise              │
│  and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not           │
│  taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on            │
│  the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again            │
│  in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.               │
│                                                                             │
│  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,              │
│  `and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half            │
│  afraid that it would be offended again.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to                │
│  Alice, and sighing.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with              │
│  wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And              │
│  she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so             │
│  that her idea of the tale was something like this:--                       │
│                                                                             │

│  `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up               │

│                                                                             │

│  The Mouse only growled in reply.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after               │
│  it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but             │
│  the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little             │
│  quicker.                                                                   │

│  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it             │
│  was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of            │
│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you           │
│  never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the               │
│  young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the                 │
│  patience of an oyster!'                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,              │
│  addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'               │
│                                                                             │
│  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'                │
│  said the Lory.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about              │
│  her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for                │
│  catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her            │
│  after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look             │
│  at it!'                                                                    │

│  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.                 │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once: one the old Magpie began            │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts            │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a                │
│  melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm             │
│  sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I                 │
│  wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice              │
│  began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.             │
│  In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of          │
│  footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping          │
│  that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to                │
│  finish his story.                                                          │

│  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                   │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!            │
│  Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me                     │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have                 │
│  dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was             │
│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │
│  the little door, had vanished completely.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,             │
│  and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE           │
│  you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of           │
│  gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened            │
│  that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without           │
│  trying to explain the mistake it had made.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.            │
│  `How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd                │
│  better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'          │
│  As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door           │
│  of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'                │
│  engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried                │
│  upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,            │
│  and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and            │
│  gloves.                                                                    │

│  `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going                  │
│  messages for a rabbit"                                                     │

│  The continuation in the `alice29.txt` file is:                             │
│  "messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on                │
│  messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that              │
│  would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready              │
│  for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see            │
│  that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went           │
│  on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering          │
│  people about like that!'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with            │
│  a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two          │
│  or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and           │
│  a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when           │
│  her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-             │
│  glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'             │
│  but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know           │
│  SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,             │
│  `whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this              │
│  bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for                 │
│  really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'                 │
│                                                                             │
│  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:                   │
│  before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing          │
│  against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being          │
│  broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself                 │
│  `That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I           │
│  can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so               │
│  much!'                                                                     │

│  Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and               │
│  growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in                  │
│  another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried             │
│  the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the          │
│  other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,           │
│  as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one             │
│  foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,            │
│  whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full            │
│  effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,           │
│  and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting           │
│  out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one            │
│  wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about          │
│  by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that                 │
│  rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,              │
│  this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!               │
│  When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing              │
│  never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There              │
│  ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when            │
│  I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a           │
│  sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more              │
│  HERE.'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I             │
│  am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-           │
│  -but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like           │
│  THAT!'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you                │
│  learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no            │
│  room at all for any lesson-books!'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,              │
│  and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few          │
│  minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves                  │
│  this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the                  │
│  stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and           │
│  she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she           │
│  was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no          │
│  reason to be afraid of it.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;            │
│  but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed             │
│  hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it             │
│  say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'               │
│                                                                             │
│  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she                │
│  fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly           │
│  spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not             │
│  get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,            │
│  and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was          │
│  just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something            │
│  of the sort.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are               │
│  you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then              │
│  I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!              │
│  Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)              │
│                                                                             │
│  `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'                             │
│                                                                             │
│  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')               │
│                                                                             │
│  `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it                    │
│  fills the whole window!'                                                   │

│  `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it             │
│  away!'                                                                     │

│  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear             │
│  whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer                │
│  honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at            │
│  last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in             │
│  the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more                 │
│  sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there            │
│  must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for            │
│  pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I           │
│  don't want to stay in here any longer!'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at                 │
│  last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a              │
│  good many voice all talking together: she made out the words:              │
│  `Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;                │
│  Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up          │
│  at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half          │
│  high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-          │
│  -Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind            │
│  that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud              │
│  crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go             │
│  down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,                │
│  then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to            │
│  go down the chimney!'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said                 │
│  Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!             │
│  I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is           │
│  narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'                      │
│                                                                             │
│  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and                │
│  waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what          │
│  sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close          │
│  above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one            │
│  sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes              │
│  Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the               │
│  hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold          │
│  up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?          │
│  What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'                │
│  thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm               │
│  better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know           │
│  is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes            │
│  like a sky-rocket!'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and                │
│  Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set                │
│  Dinah at you!'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to                   │
│  herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any! I suppose      │
│  Dinah'll be sending me on                                                  │
│  messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that              │
│  would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready              │
│  for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see            │
│  that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went           │
│  on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering          │
│  people about like that!'                                                   │
│                                                                             │

│  prizes.'                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices                  │
│  asked.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with               │
│  one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,                 │
│  calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'                           │
│                                                                             │
│  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand              │
│  in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt          │
│  water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.               │
│  There was exactly one a-piece all round.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.             │
│                                                                             │
│  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have                │
│  you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo                  │
│  solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of          │
│  this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short                │
│  speech, they all cheered.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked             │
│  so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not             │
│  think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,          │
│  looking as solemn as she could.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise              │
│  and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not           │
│  taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on            │
│  the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again            │
│  in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.               │
│                                                                             │
│  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,              │
│  `and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half            │
│  afraid that it would be offended again.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to                │
│  Alice, and sighing.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with              │
│  wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And              │
│  she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so             │
│  that her idea of the tale was something like this:--                       │
│                                                                             │

│  quicker.                                                                   │

│  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it             │

│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you           │
│  never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the               │
│  young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the                 │

│  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'                │

│  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about              │
│  her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for                │

│  at it!'                                                                    │

│  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.                 │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once: one the old Magpie began            │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts            │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a                │
│  melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm             │
│  sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I                 │
│  wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice              │
│  began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.             │
│  In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of          │
│  footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping          │
│  that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to                │
│  finish his story.                                                          │

│  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                   │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!            │
│  Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me                     │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have                 │
│  dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was             │
│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │
│  the little door, had vanished completely.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,             │
│  and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE           │
│  you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of           │
│  gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened            │
│  that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without           │
│  trying to explain the mistake it had made.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.            │
│  `How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd                │
│  better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'          │
│  As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door           │
│  of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'                │
│  engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried                │
│  upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,            │
│  and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and            │
│  gloves.                                                                    │

│  `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going                  │
│  messages for a rabbit"                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  The continuation in the `alice29.txt` file is:                             │
│  "messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on                │
│  messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that              │
│  would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready              │
│  for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see            │
│  that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went           │
│  on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering          │
│  people about like that!'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with            │
│  a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two          │
│  or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and           │
│  a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when           │
│  her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-             │
│  glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'             │
│  but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know           │
│  SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,             │
│  `whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this              │
│  bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for                 │
│  really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'                 │
│                                                                             │
│  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:                   │
│  before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing          │
│  against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being          │
│  broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself                 │
│  `That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I           │
│  can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so               │
│  much!'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and               │
│  growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in                  │
│  another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried             │
│  the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the          │
│  other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,           │
│  as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one             │
│  foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,            │
│  whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full            │
│  effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,           │
│  and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting           │
│  out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one            │
│  wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about          │
│  by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that                 │
│  rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,              │
│  this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!               │
│  When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing              │
│  never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There              │
│  ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when            │
│  I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a           │
│  sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more              │
│  HERE.'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I             │
│  am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-           │
│  -but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like           │
│  THAT!'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you                │
│  learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no            │
│  room at all for any lesson-books!'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,              │
│  and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few          │
│  minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves                  │
│  this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the                  │
│  stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and           │
│  she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she           │
│  was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no          │
│  reason to be afraid of it.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;            │
│  but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed             │
│  hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it             │
│  say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'               │
│                                                                             │
│  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she                │
│  fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly           │
│  spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not             │
│  get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,            │
│  and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was          │
│  just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something            │
│  of the sort.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are               │
│  you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then              │
│  I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!              │
│  Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)              │
│                                                                             │
│  `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'                             │

│  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear             │
│  whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer                │
│  honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at            │
│  last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in             │
│  the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more                 │
│  sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there            │
│  must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for            │
│  pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I           │
│  don't want to stay in here any longer!'                                    │

However, it was over at last, and they sat down again\nin a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n`You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,\n`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half\nafraid that it would be offended again.\n\n`Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to\nAlice, and sighing.\n\n`It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with\nwonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And\nshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so\nthat her idea of the tale was something like this:--\n\n`Fury said to a\nmouse, That he\nmet in the\nhouse,\n\"Let us\nboth go to\nlaw: I will\nprosecute\nYOU. --Come,\nI'll take no\ndenial; We\nmust have a\ntrial: For\nreally this\nmorning I've\nnothing\nto do.\"\nSaid the\nmouse to the\ncur, \"Such\na trial,\ndear Sir,\nWith\nno jury\nor judge,\nwould be\nwasting\nour\nbreath.\"\n\"I'll be\njudge, I'll\nbe jury,\"\nSaid\ncunning\nold Fury:\n\"I'll\ntry the\nwhole\ncause,\nand\ncondemn\nyou\nto\ndeath.\"'\n\n\n`You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.\n`What are you thinking of?'\n\n`I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to\nthe fifth bend, I think?'\n\n`I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n`A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and\nlooking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'\n\n`I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up\nand walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'\n\n`I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily\noffended, you know!'\n\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\n\n`Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after\nit; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but\nthe Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little\nquicker.\n\n`What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it\nwas quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of\nsaying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you\nnever to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the\nyoung Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the\npatience of an oyster!'\n\n`I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,\naddressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'\n\n`And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'\nsaid the Lory.\n\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about\nher pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for\ncatching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her\nafter the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look\nat it!'\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.\nSome of the birds hurried off at once: one the old Magpie began\nwrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be\ngetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary\ncalled out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my\ndears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts\nthey all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\n\n`I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a\nmelancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm\nsure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I\nwonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice\nbegan to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.\nIn a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of\nfootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping\nthat the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to\nfinish his story.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\n\n\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and\nlooking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;\nand she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!\nOh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me\nexecuted, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have\ndropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was\nlooking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she\nvery good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\nnowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her\nswim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and\nthe little door, had vanished completely.\n\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,\nand called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE\nyou doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of\ngloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened\nthat she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without\ntrying to explain the mistake it had made.\n\n`He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.\n`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd\nbetter take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'\nAs she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door\nof which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'\nengraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried\nupstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,\nand be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and\ngloves.\n\n`How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going\nmessages for a rabbit\"\n\nThe continuation in the `alice29.txt` file is:\n\"messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on\nmessages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that\nwould happen: '\"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready\nfor your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see\nthat the mouse doesn't get out.\" Only I don't think,' Alice went\non, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering\npeople about like that!'\n\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with\na table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two\nor three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and\na pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when\nher eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-\nglass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'\nbut nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know\nSOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,\n`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this\nbottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for\nreally I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:\nbefore she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing\nagainst the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being\nbroken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself\n`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I\ncan't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so\nmuch!'\n\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and\ngrowing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in\nanother minute there was not even room for this, and she tried\nthe effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the\nother arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,\nas a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one\nfoot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,\nwhatever happens. What WILL become of me?'\n\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full\neffect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,\nand, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting\nout of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n`It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\nwasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about\nby mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that\nrabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,\nthis sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!\nWhen I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing\nnever happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There\nought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when\nI grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a\nsorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more\nHERE.'\n\n`But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I\nam now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-\n-but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like\nTHAT!'\n\n`Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you\nlearn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no\nroom at all for any lesson-books!'\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,\nand making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few\nminutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n`Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves\nthis moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the\nstairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and\nshe trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she\nwas now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no\nreason to be afraid of it.\n\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;\nbut, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed\nhard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it\nsay to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'\n\n`THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she\nfancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly\nspread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not\nget hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,\nand a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was\njust possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something\nof the sort.\n\nNext came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are\nyou?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then\nI'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'\n\n`Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!\nCome and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\n`Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'\n\n`Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')\n\n`An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it\nfills the whole window!'\n\n`Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'\n\n`Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it\naway!'\n\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear\nwhispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer\nhonour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at\nlast she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in\nthe air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more\nsounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there\nmust be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for\npulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I\ndon't want to stay in here any longer!'\n\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at\nlast came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a\ngood many voice all talking together: she made out the words:\n`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;\nBill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up\nat this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half\nhigh enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-\n-Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind\nthat loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!

YOU do it!--That I won't,\nthen!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to\ngo down the chimney!'\n\n`Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said\nAlice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!\nI wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is\nnarrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'\n\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and\nwaited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what\nsort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close\nabove her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one\nsharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\n\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes\nBill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the\nhedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold\nup his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?\nWhat happened to you?

Thought: I have successfully read the entire content of `alice29.txt`. I will now locate the provided prefix within this text and extract the immediate continuation.

The prefix ends with:
"footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story."

I will search for this exact phrase in the `alice29.txt` content to find the precise point of continuation.
The text provided in the prompt is:
"at deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At
last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have
prizes.'

`But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices
asked.

`Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with
one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,
calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand
in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt
water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
There was exactly one a-piece all round.

`But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.

`Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have
you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.

`Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.

`Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short
speech, they all cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked
so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not
think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,
looking as solemn as she could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise
and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again
in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

`You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,
`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half
afraid that it would be offended again.

`Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to
Alice, and sighing.

`It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with
wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And
she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so
that her idea of the tale was something like this:--

`Fury said to a
mouse, That he
met in the
house,
"Let us
both go to
law: I will
prosecute
YOU. --Come,
I'll take no
denial; We
must have a
trial: For
really this
morning I've
nothing
to do."
Said the
mouse to the
cur, "Such
a trial,
dear Sir,
With
no jury
or judge,
would be
wasting
our
breath."
"I'll be
judge, I'll
be jury,"
Said
cunning
old Fury:
"I'll
try the
whole
cause,
and
condemn
you
to
death."'


`You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.
`What are you thinking of?'

`I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to
the fifth bend, I think?'

`I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

`A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and
looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'

`I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up
and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'

`I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily
offended, you know!'

The Mouse only growled in reply.

`Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after
it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but
the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
quicker.

`What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it
was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of
saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you
never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the
young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the
patience of an oyster!'

`I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'

`And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'
said the Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about
her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for
catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her
after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look
at it!'

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
Some of the birds hurried off at once: one the old Magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be
getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary
called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my
dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts
they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

`I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a
melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm
sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I
wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice
began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.
In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of
footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping
that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to
finish his story.



CHAPTER IV

The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and
looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;
and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!
Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me
executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have
dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was
looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she
very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and
the little door, had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,
and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE
you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of
gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without
trying to explain the mistake it had made.

`He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.
`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd
better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'
As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door
of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'
engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried
upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,
and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
gloves.

`How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going
messages for a rabbit"

The continuation in the `alice29.txt` file is:
"messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on
messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that
would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready
for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see
that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went
on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
people about like that!'

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with
a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and
a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when
her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-
glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know
SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,
`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this
bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for
really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:
before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing
against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being
broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself
`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I
can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so
much!'

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and
growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in
another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the
other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,
as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one
foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,
whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,
and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

`It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one
wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that
rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,
this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing
never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There
ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when
I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a
sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more
HERE.'

`But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I
am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-
-but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like
THAT!'

`Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you
learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no
room at all for any lesson-books!'

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,
and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few
minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

`Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves
this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the
stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she
was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no
reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;
but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed
hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it
say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'

`THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she
fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly
spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not
get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,
and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
of the sort.

Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are
you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then
I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'

`Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!
Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)

`Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'

`Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')

`An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it
fills the whole window!'

`Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'

`Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it
away!'

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer
honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at
last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in
the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more
sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there
must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for
pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I
don't want to stay in here any longer!'

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a
good many voice all talking together: she made out the words:
`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;
Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up
at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half
high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-
-Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind
that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud
crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go
down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,
then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
go down the chimney!'

`Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said
Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is
narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and
waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what
sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one
sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes
Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the
hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold
up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?
What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'
thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm
better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know
is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes
like a sky-rocket!'

`So you did, old fellow!' said the others.

`We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and
Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set
Dinah at you!'

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to
herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on
messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that
would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready
for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see
that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went
on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
people about like that!'
