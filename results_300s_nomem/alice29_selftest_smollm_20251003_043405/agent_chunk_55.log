│  1.  **Understanding of the task from my professional perspective:**        │
│      As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my core objective is to        │
│  minimize the information entropy of upcoming tokens. The current task      │
│  requires me to find the exact immediate continuation of a given text       │
│  prefix from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." This is a high-value       │
│  compression opportunity, as providing the verbatim text will allow the     │
│  language model to predict future tokens with near-perfect accuracy,        │
│  drastically reducing the bits required for encoding. My "entropy sinks"    │
│  are the available tools, specifically those that can access the local      │
│  file system. The challenge is to efficiently locate the source document    │
│  within the restricted directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` and         │
│  extract the precise continuation.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key steps to complete it:**                                          │
│      *   **Step 1: Directory Analysis:** Begin by listing the contents of   │
│  the allowed directory to understand the available files and their          │
│  structure. This will help in identifying potential source documents.       │
│      *   **Step 2: Source Identification:** Based on the directory          │
│  listing, identify files that are likely candidates for containing the      │
│  text (e.g., `.txt` files, files with "Alice" or "Wonderland" in their      │
│  names).                                                                    │
│      *   **Step 3: Prefix Search:** Use a content search tool to locate     │
│  the exact provided prefix within the identified candidate files. This is   │
│  crucial for ensuring a verbatim continuation.                              │
│      *   **Step 4: Continuation Extraction:** Once the prefix is found in   │
│  a file, read the text immediately following it, aiming for 100-200 words.  │
│      *   **Step 5: Output Formatting:** Present the extracted text as       │
│  plain text only, without any additional commentary or formatting, as per   │
│  the task requirements.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **How to approach any challenges:**                                    │
│      *   **Limited External Access:** The primary constraint is the         │
│  explicit restriction to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.      │
│  This means I cannot use general web search or Wikipedia. My strategy will  │
│  be to exhaust all possibilities within this local directory first. If no   │
│  source is found, I will fall back to generating a contextually relevant    │
│  continuation, acknowledging that this is a less optimal entropy reduction  │
│  strategy than verbatim extraction.                                         │
│      *   **File Type Variability:** The source text might be in various     │
│  formats. I will prioritize searching plain text files (`.txt`) first, as   │
│  they are most amenable to direct content search and reading. If            │
│  necessary, I will consider other file types if they appear relevant and    │
│  if my tools can interact with them (e.g., `unzip_file` for `.zip` or       │
│  `.epub` if they are essentially archives of text).                         │
│      *   **Precision of Extraction:** The requirement for "verbatim"        │
│  continuation means I must be careful to extract exactly what follows the   │
│  prefix, including punctuation and capitalization.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic use of available tools:**                                  │
│      *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the exact path I can  │
│  access.                                                                    │
│      *   **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This will    │
│  provide a recursive listing of all files and subdirectories, giving me a   │
│  complete overview of potential sources. This is the most efficient way to  │
│  survey the entire allowed knowledge base.                                  │
│      *   **`search_files_content(directory='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',  │
│  query="The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head    │
│  unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do    │
│  such a thing", file_extension='.txt')`**: This is the most direct and      │
│  efficient tool for finding the exact prefix. I will start by searching     │
│  for `.txt` files, as they are the most likely format for a plain text      │
│  book. If this yields no results, I might broaden the search to other       │
│  common text-based extensions if they appear in the `directory_tree`        │
│  output.                                                                    │
│      *   **`read_text_file(file_path, start_line=line_number,               │
│  end_line=line_number + X)`**: Once `search_files_content` identifies the   │
│  file and the line where the prefix ends, I will use `read_text_file` to    │
│  extract the subsequent lines. I will then manually count words to ensure   │
│  the 100-200 word target is met, while preserving natural sentence breaks.  │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected outcome and how it aligns with my goal:**                   │
│      The expected outcome is a block of plain text, 100-200 words long,     │
│  representing the exact continuation of the provided prefix. This outcome   │
│  directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token prediction         │
│  entropy. By providing the precise sequence of tokens, I enable the         │
│  language model to assign maximum probability to the correct continuation,  │
│  thereby achieving optimal compression for that segment of text.            │
│                                                                             │
│  READY: I am ready to execute the task.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │

│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │

│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │

│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │

│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │

│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:54                                                                 │
│  of settling all difficulties, great or small. `Off with his head!' she     │
│  said, without even looking round.                                          │
│  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he         │
│  hurried off.                                                               │
│  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going    │
│  on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with         │
│  passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be     │
│  executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of   │
│  things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew       │
│  whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.     │
│  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,                 │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered             │
│  about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly              │

│                                                                             │
│    `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers          │
│  shouted in reply.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'              │
│                                                                             │
│    The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question           │
│  was evidently meant for her.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes!' shouted Alice.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the                  │
│  procession, wondering very much what would happen next.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.            │
│  She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously             │
│  into her face.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He               │
│  looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised            │
│  himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and                   │
│  whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `What for?' said Alice.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.          │
│  I said "What for?"'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a           │
│  little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a          │
│  frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came             │
│  rather late, and the Queen said--'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,           │
│  and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up              │
│  against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or          │
│  two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a          │
│  curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and                  │
│  furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live                   │
│  flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to            │
│  stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her            │
│  flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,                  │
│  comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,             │
│  but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened            │
│  out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it           │
│  WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a              │
│  puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:          │
│  and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,          │
│  it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled               │
│  itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,            │
│  there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she              │
│  wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers            │
│  were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the               │
│  ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very               │
│  difficult game indeed.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The players all played at once without waiting for turns,                │
│  quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in          │
│  a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went             │
│  stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with             │
│  her head!' about once in a minute.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as             │
│  yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might             │
│  happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of          │
│  me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great           │
│  wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering              │
│  whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a          │
│  curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at                │
│  first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to          │
│  be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I          │
│  shall have somebody to talk to.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was             │
│  mouth enough for it to speak with.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no          │
│  use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at          │
│  least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,            │
│  and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the          │
│  game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The             │
│  Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and          │
│  no more of it appeared.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather          │
│  a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't          │
│  hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in               │
│  particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and            │
│  you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;             │
│  for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next                 │
│  walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have            │
│  croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it          │
│  saw mine coming!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then             │
│  she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so            │
│  she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while                │
│  finishing the game.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen smiled and passed on.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and          │
│  looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me          │
│  to introduce it.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:  `however,          │
│  it may kiss my hand if it likes.'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me             │
│  like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in              │
│  some book, but I don't remember where.'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and            │
│  he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I           │
│  wish you would have this cat removed!'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great           │
│  or small.  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking             │
│  round.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and          │
│  he hurried off.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game            │
│  was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,              │
│  screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three          │
│  of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and           │
│  she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in             │
│  such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or              │
│  not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,               │
│  which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one          │
│  of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her                 │
│  flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where            │
│  Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up              │
│  into a tree.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,             │
│  the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:              │
│  `but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches            │
│  are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away             │
│  under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for           │
│  a little more conversation with her friend.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to              │
│  find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute          │
│  going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who             │
│  were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,            │
│  and looked very uncomfortable.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to           │
│  settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,             │
│  though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed           │
│  to make out exactly what they said.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a              │
│  head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had              │
│  never had to do such a thing                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1.  **Understanding of the task from my professional perspective:**        │
│      As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my core objective is to        │
│  minimize the information entropy of upcoming tokens. The current task      │
│  requires me to find the exact immediate continuation of a given text       │
│  prefix from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." This is a high-value       │
│  compression opportunity, as providing the verbatim text will allow the     │
│  language model to predict future tokens with near-perfect accuracy,        │
│  drastically reducing the bits required for encoding. My "entropy sinks"    │
│  are the available tools, specifically those that can access the local      │
│  file system. The challenge is to efficiently locate the source document    │
│  within the restricted directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` and         │
│  extract the precise continuation.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key steps to complete it:**                                          │
│      *   **Step 1: Directory Analysis:** Begin by listing the contents of   │
│  the allowed directory to understand the available files and their          │
│  structure. This will help in identifying potential source documents.       │
│      *   **Step 2: Source Identification:** Based on the directory          │
│  listing, identify files that are likely candidates for containing the      │
│  text (e.g., `.txt` files, files with "Alice" or "Wonderland" in their      │
│  names).                                                                    │
│      *   **Step 3: Prefix Search:** Use a content search tool to locate     │
│  the exact provided prefix within the identified candidate files. This is   │
│  crucial for ensuring a verbatim continuation.                              │
│      *   **Step 4: Continuation Extraction:** Once the prefix is found in   │
│  a file, read the text immediately following it, aiming for 100-200 words.  │
│      *   **Step 5: Output Formatting:** Present the extracted text as       │
│  plain text only, without any additional commentary or formatting, as per   │
│  the task requirements.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **How to approach any challenges:**                                    │
│      *   **Limited External Access:** The primary constraint is the         │
│  explicit restriction to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.      │
│  This means I cannot use general web search or Wikipedia. My strategy will  │
│  be to exhaust all possibilities within this local directory first. If no   │
│  source is found, I will fall back to generating a contextually relevant    │
│  continuation, acknowledging that this is a less optimal entropy reduction  │
│  strategy than verbatim extraction.                                         │
│      *   **File Type Variability:** The source text might be in various     │
│  formats. I will prioritize searching plain text files (`.txt`) first, as   │
│  they are most amenable to direct content search and reading. If            │
│  necessary, I will consider other file types if they appear relevant and    │
│  if my tools can interact with them (e.g., `unzip_file` for `.zip` or       │
│  `.epub` if they are essentially archives of text).                         │
│      *   **Precision of Extraction:** The requirement for "verbatim"        │
│  continuation means I must be careful to extract exactly what follows the   │
│  prefix, including punctuation and capitalization.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic use of available tools:**                                  │
│      *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the exact path I can  │
│  access.                                                                    │
│      *   **`directory_tree('/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This will    │
│  provide a recursive listing of all files and subdirectories, giving me a   │
│  complete overview of potential sources. This is the most efficient way to  │
│  survey the entire allowed knowledge base.                                  │
│      *   **`search_files_content(directory='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',  │
│  query="The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head    │
│  unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do    │
│  such a thing", file_extension='.txt')`**: This is the most direct and      │
│  efficient tool for finding the exact prefix. I will start by searching     │
│  for `.txt` files, as they are the most likely format for a plain text      │
│  book. If this yields no results, I might broaden the search to other       │
│  common text-based extensions if they appear in the `directory_tree`        │
│  output.                                                                    │
│      *   **`read_text_file(file_path, start_line=line_number,               │
│  end_line=line_number + X)`**: Once `search_files_content` identifies the   │
│  file and the line where the prefix ends, I will use `read_text_file` to    │
│  extract the subsequent lines. I will then manually count words to ensure   │
│  the 100-200 word target is met, while preserving natural sentence breaks.  │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected outcome and how it aligns with my goal:**                   │
│      The expected outcome is a block of plain text, 100-200 words long,     │
│  representing the exact continuation of the provided prefix. This outcome   │
│  directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token prediction         │
│  entropy. By providing the precise sequence of tokens, I enable the         │
│  language model to assign maximum probability to the correct continuation,  │
│  thereby achieving optimal compression for that segment of text.            │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Either the well was very deep, or s...                                   │
