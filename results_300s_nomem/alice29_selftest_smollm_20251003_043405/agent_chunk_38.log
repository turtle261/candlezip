│  find the exact immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the provided      │
│  text prefix. This aligns perfectly with my objective of minimizing future  │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context. The   │
│  output must be plain text only.\n\n2. **Initial Directory Analysis:**\n    │
│  *   First, I will use `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm the exact    │
│  path I can access.\n    *   Then, I will use                               │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')` and                │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')` to get a           │
│  comprehensive overview of the files and subdirectories within the          │
│  designated "sink" directory. This will help me identify potential source   │
│  documents, especially those related to classic literature, given the       │
│  nature of the prefix (Alice in Wonderland).\n\n3. **Locate the Source      │
│  Document:**\n    *   Based on the prefix, the text is clearly from         │
│  "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland." I will look for files that might      │
│  contain this text.\n    *   The most efficient way to find the exact       │
│  location of the prefix is to use `search_files_content`. I will search     │
│  for the last sentence of the prefix: `"So she set the little creature      │
│  down, and felt quite relieved to"` within the                              │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This will pinpoint the exact     │
│  file and line number if it exists.\n\n4. **Extract Verbatim                │
│  Continuation:**\n    *   Once `search_files_content` identifies the file   │
│  containing the prefix, I will use `read_text_file` to read the content of  │
│  that file.\n    *   I will then programmatically (or by careful indexing)  │
│  extract the 100-200 words immediately following the identified prefix. I   │
│  will ensure to capture natural sentence breaks and maintain the original   │
│  formatting (or lack thereof) to provide a verbatim continuation.\n\n5.     │
│  **Handle Challenges:**\n    *   **Source Not Found:** If                   │
│  `search_files_content` yields no results, it means the source document is  │
│  not directly available in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.    │
│  In this scenario, as per the instructions, I will generate a continuation  │
│  based solely on the current prefix context, ensuring it is specific and    │
│  avoids generic text. However, given the prompt\'s emphasis on "aggressive  │
│  MCP tool usage," I anticipate finding the source.\n    *   **Multiple      │
│  Matches:** If multiple files contain the prefix, I will examine the        │
│  surrounding text in each file using `read_text_file` to determine the      │
│  most accurate source, prioritizing the one that provides the most          │
│  coherent and logical continuation.\n\n6. **Final Output Generation:**\n    │
│  *   The extracted continuation will be presented as plain text only,       │
│  without any markdown, analysis, commentary, formatting, lists, headings,   │
│  or meta-text, directly fulfilling the output requirements.\n\n7.           │
│  **Alignment with Goal:** By providing the exact verbatim continuation, I   │
│  will directly reduce the cross-entropy for future token predictions,       │
│  allowing the language model to assign high probability to the actual       │
│  upcoming tokens, thus minimizing the expected description length under     │
│  arithmetic coding. This is a direct application of my core competency in   │
│  ENTROPY MINIMIZATION and TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING.\n', 'ready': False}     │

│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd             │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the                  │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't               │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,              │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end: then stop.'                                      │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't            │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And             │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you                │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.              │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's              │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                 │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my             │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off             │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.                          │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having               │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                  │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half           │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's           │
│  getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she             │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about              │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their              │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│  on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For          │
│  instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let             │
│  you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time           │
│  he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But           │
│  perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so           │
│  VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might              │
│  answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'              │
│                                                                             │
│    At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate           │
│  came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just                │
│  grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees              │
│  behind him.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,          │
│  exactly as if nothing had happened.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.               │
│                                                                             │
│    `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's the               │
│  first question, you know.'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.                │
│  `It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the          │
│  creatures argue.  It's enough to drive one crazy!'                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for                  │
│  repeating his remark, with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he             │
│  said, `on and off, for days and days.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `But what am I to do?' said Alice.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:          │
│  `he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.            │
│                                                                             │
│    The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of               │
│  smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a             │
│  three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was             │
│  leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to           │
│  be full of soup.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to          │
│  herself, as well as she could for sneezing.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the                 │
│  Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was                  │
│  sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The            │
│  only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,             │
│  and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from          │
│  ear to ear.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for            │
│  she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to              │
│  speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.                │
│  Pig!'                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice              │
│  quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed          │
│  to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on              │
│  again:--                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I             │
│  didn't know that cats COULD grin.'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,                 │
│  feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought           │
│  it would be as well to introduce some other subject of                     │
│  conversation.  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took           │
│  the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work                 │
│  throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby           │
│  --the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,          │
│  plates, and dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when          │
│  they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it            │
│  was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up             │
│  and down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS              │
│  nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very           │
│  nearly carried it off.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a          │
│  hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it              │
│  does.'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very             │
│  glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her                  │
│  knowledge.  `Just think of what work it would make with the day            │
│  and night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn              │
│  round on its axis--'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant          │
│  to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and           │
│  seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four            │
│  hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?  I--'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide            │
│  figures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again,                │
│  singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a             │
│  violent shake at the end of every line:                                    │
│                                                                             │
│          `Speak roughly to your little boy,                                 │
│            And beat him when he sneezes:                                    │
│          He only does it to annoy,                                          │

│                                                                             │
│      (In which the cook and the baby joined):--                             │
│                                                                             │
│                  `Wow! wow! wow!'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept            │
│  tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing          │
│  howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--                       │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│                      CHORUS.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                  `Wow! wow! wow!'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said            │
│  to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.  `I must go and           │
│  get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of          │
│  the room.  The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,          │
│  but it just missed her.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-           │
│  shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all              │
│  directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.  The poor              │
│  little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,          │
│  and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,            │
│  so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much            │
│  as she could do to hold it.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,                │
│  (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep               │
│  tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its            │
│  undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.  `IF I              │
│  don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure          │
│  to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it             │
│  behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing           │
│  grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't          │
│  grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing          │
│  yourself.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into             │
│  its face to see what was the matter with it.  There could be no            │
│  doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout              │
│  than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for           │
│  a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at            │
│  all.  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked           │
│  into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    No, there were no tears.  `If you're going to turn into a pig,           │
│  my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do             │
│  with you.  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed again (or              │
│  grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for             │
│  some while in silence.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I            │
│  to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted              │
│  again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some            │
│  alarm.  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was              │
│  neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be            │
│  quite absurd for her to carry it further.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to          │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1. **Understand the Task:** The core task is to find the exact immediate   │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided text prefix. This aligns      │
│  perfectly with my objective of minimizing future token prediction entropy  │
│  by providing maximally informative context. The output must be plain text  │
│  only.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Initial Directory Analysis:**                                         │
│      *   First, I will use `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm the      │
│  exact path I can access.                                                   │
│      *   Then, I will use                                                   │
│  `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` and                  │
│  `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` to get a             │
│  comprehensive overview of the files and subdirectories within the          │
│  designated "sink" directory. This will help me identify potential source   │
│  documents, especially those related to classic literature, given the       │
│  nature of the prefix (Alice in Wonderland).                                │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Locate the Source Document:**                                         │
│      *   Based on the prefix, the text is clearly from "Alice's Adventures  │
│  in Wonderland." I will look for files that might contain this text.        │
│      *   The most efficient way to find the exact location of the prefix    │
│  is to use `search_files_content`. I will search for the last sentence of   │
│  the prefix: `"So she set the little creature down, and felt quite          │
│  relieved to"` within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This    │
│  will pinpoint the exact file and line number if it exists.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Extract Verbatim Continuation:**                                      │
│      *   Once `search_files_content` identifies the file containing the     │
│  prefix, I will use `read_text_file` to read the content of that file.      │
│      *   I will then programmatically (or by careful indexing) extract the  │
│  100-200 words immediately following the identified prefix. I will ensure   │
│  to capture natural sentence breaks and maintain the original formatting    │
│  (or lack thereof) to provide a verbatim continuation.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Handle Challenges:**                                                  │
│      *   **Source Not Found:** If `search_files_content` yields no          │
│  results, it means the source document is not directly available in the     │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. In this scenario, as per the     │
│  instructions, I will generate a continuation based solely on the current   │
│  prefix context, ensuring it is specific and avoids generic text. However,  │
│  given the prompt's emphasis on "aggressive MCP tool usage," I anticipate   │
│  finding the source.                                                        │
│      *   **Multiple Matches:** If multiple files contain the prefix, I      │
│  will examine the surrounding text in each file using `read_text_file` to   │
│  determine the most accurate source, prioritizing the one that provides     │
│  the most coherent and logical continuation.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  6. **Final Output Generation:**                                            │
│      *   The extracted continuation will be presented as plain text only,   │
│  without any markdown, analysis, commentary, formatting, lists, headings,   │
│  or meta-text, directly fulfilling the output requirements.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  7. **Alignment with Goal:** By providing the exact verbatim continuation,  │
│  I will directly reduce the cross-entropy for future token predictions,     │
│  allowing the language model to assign high probability to the actual       │
│  upcoming tokens, thus minimizing the expected description length under     │
│  arithmetic coding. This is a direct application of my core competency in   │
│  ENTROPY MINIMIZATION and TOOL-AUGMENTED REASONING.                         │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
