│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Understand the Task:** The        │
│  primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by finding     │
│  the exact immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the provided text      │
│  prefix. This requires locating the source document ("Alice\'s Adventures   │
│  in Wonderland") within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory and    │
│  extracting the verbatim text that follows the given prefix.\n\n2. **Key    │
│  Steps:**\n    a. **Directory Exploration:** Begin by listing the contents  │
│  of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its          │
│  structure and identify potential files.\n    b. **Source Document          │
│  Identification:** Use a highly specific phrase from the end of the         │
│  provided prefix to search for the exact source document within the         │
│  allowed directory. This will ensure accuracy in locating "Alice\'s         │
│  Adventures in Wonderland."\n    c. **Content Retrieval:** Once the source  │
│  file is identified, read its entire content to enable precise location of  │
│  the prefix.\n    d. **Continuation Extraction:** Locate the exact          │
│  position of the prefix within the retrieved content and extract the        │
│  subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.\n    e. **Output Formatting:** Present  │
│  the extracted continuation as plain text only, without any additional      │
│  formatting, analysis, or commentary.\n\n3. **Approach to Challenges:**\n   │
│  a. **File Location:** The `search_files_content` tool is ideal for         │
│  pinpointing the exact file containing the prefix, even if the directory    │
│  contains many files.\n    b. **Exact Prefix Matching:** By using a unique  │
│  and specific phrase from the end of the prefix, I minimize the chance of   │
│  false positives during the search.\n    c. **Verbatim Extraction:** Once   │
│  the file content is read, standard string manipulation (conceptually, as   │
│  I will perform this in my response generation after tool output) will be   │
│  used to find the prefix and extract the subsequent text. I will carefully  │
│  count words to adhere to the 100-200 word limit.\n    d. **Tool Failure    │
│  Fallback:** If, against expectations, tools fail to locate the source, I   │
│  will generate a contextually relevant continuation based solely on the     │
│  provided prefix, prioritizing specificity and natural flow.\n\n4.          │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    a.                                          │
│  **`directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: This will be  │
│  the initial step to get a hierarchical view of the allowed directory,      │
│  helping to understand the file organization.\n    b.                       │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'The soldiers were silent,\')`**: This is the most crucial tool     │
│  for finding the specific file. The query "The soldiers were silent," is    │
│  the exact ending of the provided prefix, making it highly effective for    │
│  precise identification.\n    c.                                            │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`**: Once                     │
│  `search_files_content` returns the file path, this tool will be used to    │
│  read the entire content of that file. This allows for accurate in-memory   │
│  searching for the prefix and extraction of the continuation.\n\n5.         │
│  **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a block of plain text,            │
│  consisting of 100-200 words that immediately and verbatim follow the       │
│  provided prefix from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland." This outcome     │
│  directly aligns with the goal of minimizing future token prediction        │
│  entropy by providing highly accurate and contextually rich                 │
│  information.\n'}                                                           │

│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the                 │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│   this last remark.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse            │
│  go on for some time without interrupting it.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and          │
│  rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew           │
│  all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why with an M?' said Alice.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why not?' said the March Hare.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was silent.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going             │
│  off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up           │
│  again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an           │
│  M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--           │
│  you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever             │
│  see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I             │
│  don't think--'                                                             │

│    `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got          │
│  up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep              │
│  instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her          │
│  going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that              │
│  they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were          │
│  trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she               │
│  picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I          │
│  ever was at in all my life!'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a           │
│  door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.           │
│  `But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at           │
│  once.'  And in she went.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the           │
│  little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' she              │
│  said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and            │
│  unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to             │
│  work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her           │
│  pocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the          │
│  little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the                │
│  beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool                │
│  fountains.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the            │
│  roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at          │
│  it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious           │
│  thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up          │
│  to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go          │
│  splashing paint over me like that!'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged          │
│  my elbow.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always          │
│  lay the blame on others!'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen say only         │
│  yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it             │
│  was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all             │
│  the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as           │
│  she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the             │
│  others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are          │
│  painting those roses?'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a          │
│  low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to             │
│  have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;           │
│  and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads          │
│  cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore          │
│  she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously              │
│  looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'             │
│  and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon               │
│  their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice               │
│  looked round, eager to see the Queen.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped            │
│  like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and            │
│  feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were                   │
│  ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the          │
│  soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were             │
│  ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand          │
│  in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next          │
│  came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice             │
│  recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous          │
│  manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without           │
│  noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the             │
│  King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this            │
│  grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on           │
│  her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember              │
│  every having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,            │
│  what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people            │
│  had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see            │
│  it?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped             │
│  and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'              │
│  She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in           │
│  reply.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,              │
│  turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very              │
│  politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of          │
│  cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three               │
│  gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as              │
│  they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs             │
│  was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether           │
│  they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her            │
│  own children.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.           │
│  `It's no business of MINE.'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her            │
│  for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!               │
│  Off--'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the               │
│  Queen was silent.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said                    │
│  `Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave            │
│  `Turn them over!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the               │
│  three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the               │
│  King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'              │
│  And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you            │
│  been doing here?'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,           │
│  going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the            │
│  roses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,               │
│  three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate          │
│  gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a            │
│  large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered             │
│  about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly              │
│  marched off after the others.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers          │
│  shouted in reply.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'              │
│                                                                             │
│    The soldiers were silent,                                                │

│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Directory Exploration:** Begin by listing the contents of the     │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its structure and   │
│  identify potential files.                                                  │
│      b. **Source Document Identification:** Use a highly specific phrase    │
│  from the end of the provided prefix to search for the exact source         │
│  document within the allowed directory. This will ensure accuracy in        │
│  locating "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."                               │
│      c. **Content Retrieval:** Once the source file is identified, read     │
│  its entire content to enable precise location of the prefix.               │
│      d. **Continuation Extraction:** Locate the exact position of the       │
│  prefix within the retrieved content and extract the subsequent 100-200     │
│  words verbatim.                                                            │
│      e. **Output Formatting:** Present the extracted continuation as plain  │
│  text only, without any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.     │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│      a. **File Location:** The `search_files_content` tool is ideal for     │
│  pinpointing the exact file containing the prefix, even if the directory    │
│  contains many files.                                                       │
│      b. **Exact Prefix Matching:** By using a unique and specific phrase    │
│  from the end of the prefix, I minimize the chance of false positives       │
│  during the search.                                                         │
│      c. **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the file content is read, standard    │
│  string manipulation (conceptually, as I will perform this in my response   │
│  generation after tool output) will be used to find the prefix and extract  │
│  the subsequent text. I will carefully count words to adhere to the         │
│  100-200 word limit.                                                        │
│      d. **Tool Failure Fallback:** If, against expectations, tools fail to  │
│  locate the source, I will generate a contextually relevant continuation    │
│  based solely on the provided prefix, prioritizing specificity and natural  │
│  flow.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      a. **`directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This     │
│  will be the initial step to get a hierarchical view of the allowed         │
│  directory, helping to understand the file organization.                    │
│      b. **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',        │
│  query='The soldiers were silent,')`**: This is the most crucial tool for   │
│  finding the specific file. The query "The soldiers were silent," is the    │
│  exact ending of the provided prefix, making it highly effective for        │
│  precise identification.                                                    │
│      c. **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`**: Once                │
│  `search_files_content` returns the file path, this tool will be used to    │
│  read the entire content of that file. This allows for accurate in-memory   │
│  searching for the prefix and extraction of the continuation.               │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a block of plain text,         │
│  consisting of 100-200 words that immediately and verbatim follow the       │
│  provided prefix from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." This outcome      │
│  directly aligns with the goal of minimizing future token prediction        │
│  entropy by providing highly accurate and contextually rich information.    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The task requires me to find the exact continuation of   │
│  the provided text prefix from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". I need   │
│  to use the available tools to locate the source document within the        │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, read its content, find the       │
│  prefix, and then extract the next 100-200 words verbatim.                  │
│  First, I will use `directory_tree` to get an overview of the allowed       │
│  directory. This will help me understand the structure and identify         │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Current Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact        │
│  immediate continuation that follows this prefix.                           │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  If ALL tools fail:                                                         │
│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │
│   nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                                     │
│  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                          │
│  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,               │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │
│  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of                 │
│  they jurymen.                                                              │
│  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the                  │
│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.               │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and             │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the                 │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│   this last remark.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse            │
│  go on for some time without interrupting it.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and          │
│  rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew           │
│  all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why with an M?' said Alice.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why not?' said the March Hare.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was silent.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going             │
│  off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up           │
│  again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an           │
│  M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--           │
│  you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever             │
│  see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I             │
│  don't think--'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got          │
│  up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep              │
│  instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her          │
│  going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that              │
│  they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were          │
│  trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she               │
│  picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I          │
│  ever was at in all my life!'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a           │
│  door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.           │
│  `But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at           │
│  once.'  And in she went.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the           │
│  little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' she              │
│  said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and            │
│  unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to             │
│  work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her           │
│  pocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the          │
│  little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the                │
│  beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool                │
│  fountains.                                                                 │

│    A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the            │
│  roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at          │
│  it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious           │
│  thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up          │
│  to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go          │
│  splashing paint over me like that!'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged          │
│  my elbow.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always          │
│  lay the blame on others!'                                                  │

│    `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen say only         │
│  yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it             │
│  was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all             │
│  the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as           │
│  she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the             │
│  others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are          │
│  painting those roses?'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a          │
│  low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to             │
│  have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;           │
│  and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads          │
│  cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore          │
│  she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously              │
│  looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'             │
│  and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon               │
│  their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice               │
│  looked round, eager to see the Queen.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped            │
│  like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and            │
│  feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were                   │
│  ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the          │
│  soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were             │
│  ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand          │
│  in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next          │
│  came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice             │
│  recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous          │
│  manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without           │
│  noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the             │
│  King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this            │
│  grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on           │
│  her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember              │
│  every having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,            │
│  what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people            │
│  had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see            │
│  it?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped             │
│  and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'              │
│  She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in           │
│  reply.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,              │
│  turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very              │
│  politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of          │
│  cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three               │
│  gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as              │
│  they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs             │
│  was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether           │
│  they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her            │
│  own children.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
> Stop watching for updates
│    `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.           │
│  `It's no business of MINE.'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her            │
│  for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!               │
│  Off--'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the               │
│  Queen was silent.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said                    │
│  `Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave            │
│  `Turn them over!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the               │
│  three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the               │
│  King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'              │
│  And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you            │
│  been doing here?'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,           │
│  going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the            │
│  roses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,               │
│  three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate          │
│  gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a            │
│  large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered             │
│  about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly              │
│  marched off after the others.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers          │
│  shouted in reply.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'              │
│                                                                             │
│    The soldiers were silent,                                                │
│                                                                             │

│  Current Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact        │
│  immediate continuation that follows this prefix.                           │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  If ALL tools fail:                                                         │
│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │
│   nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                                     │
│  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                          │
│  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,               │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │
│  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of                 │
│  they jurymen.                                                              │
│  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the                  │
│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.               │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and             │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the                 │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │

│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse            │
│  go on for some time without interrupting it.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and          │
│  rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew           │
│  all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why with an M?' said Alice.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why not?' said the March Hare.                                          │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going             │
│  off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up           │
│  again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an           │
│  M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--           │
│  you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever             │
│  see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I             │
│  don't think--'                                                             │

│    `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got          │
│  up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep              │
│  instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her          │
│  going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that              │
│  they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were          │
│  trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she               │
│  picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I          │
│  ever was at in all my life!'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a           │
│  door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.           │
│  `But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at           │
│  once.'  And in she went.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the           │
│  little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' she              │
│  said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and            │
│  unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to             │
│  work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her           │
│  pocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the          │
│  little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the                │
│  beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool                │
│  fountains.                                                                 │

│    A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the            │
│  roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at          │
│  it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious           │
│  thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up          │
│  to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go          │
│  splashing paint over me like that!'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged          │
│  my elbow.'                                                                 │

│    On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always          │
│  lay the blame on others!'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen say only         │
│  yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it             │
│  was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all             │
│  the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as           │
│  she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the             │
│  others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are          │
│  painting those roses?'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a          │
│  low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to             │
│  have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;           │
│  and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads          │
│  cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore          │
│  she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously              │
│  looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'             │
│  and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon               │
│  their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice               │
│  looked round, eager to see the Queen.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped            │
│  like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and            │
│  feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were                   │
│  ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the          │
│  soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were             │
│  ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand          │
│  in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next          │
│  came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice             │
│  recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous          │
│  manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without           │
│  noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the             │
│  King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this            │
│  grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on           │
│  her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember              │
│  every having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,            │
│  what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people            │
│  had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see            │
│  it?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped             │
│  and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'              │
│  She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in           │
│  reply.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,              │
│  turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very              │
│  politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of          │
│  cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three               │
│  gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as              │
│  they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs             │
│  was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether           │
│  they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her            │
│  own children.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.           │
│  `It's no business of MINE.'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her            │
│  for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!               │
│  Off--'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the               │
│  Queen was silent.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said                    │
│  `Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave            │
│  `Turn them over!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the               │
│  three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the               │
│  King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'              │
│  And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you            │
│  been doing here?'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,           │
│  going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the            │
│  roses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,               │
│  three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate          │
│  gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a            │
│  large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered             │
│  about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly              │
│  marched off after the others.                                              │

There was a dead silence.\n`It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and\neverybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the\nKing said, for about the twentieth time that day.\n`No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'\n`Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having\nthe sentence first!'\n`Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.\n`I won't!' said Alice.\n`Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.\nNobody moved.\n`Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full\nsize by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying\ndown upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half\nof anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on\nthe bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently\nbrushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the\ntrees upon her face.\n`Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long\nsleep you've had!'\n`Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told\nher sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and\nwhen she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a\ncurious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's\ngetting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she\nran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her\nhead on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of\nlittle Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began\ndreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the\ntiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes\nwere looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her\nvoice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back\nthe wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and\nstill as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place\naround her became alive the strange creatures of her little\nsister's dream.\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried\nby--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the\nneighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as\nthe March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,\nand the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate\nguests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the\nDuchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once\nmore the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's\nslate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable\nMock Turtle.\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and\nall would change to dull reality--the grass would be only\nrustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the\nreeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-\nbells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd\nboy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and\nall thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the\nconfused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the\ncattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\nheavy sobs.\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of\nhers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how\nshe would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and\nloving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about\nher other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager\nwith many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of\nWonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their\nsimple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\nremembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\nTHE END\n\n\nCurrent document prefix (UTF-8 text):\n this last remark.\n\n  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'\n\n  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse\ngo on for some time without interrupting it.\n\n  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and\nrubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew\nall manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'\n\n  `Why with an M?' said Alice.\n\n  `Why not?' said the March Hare.\n\n  Alice was silent.\n\n  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going\noff into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up\nagain with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an\nM, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--\nyou know you say things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever\nsee such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'\n\n  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I\ndon't think--'\n\n  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.\n\n  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got\nup in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep\ninstantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her\ngoing, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that\nthey would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were\ntrying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.\n\n  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she\npicked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I\never was at in all my life!'\n\n  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a\ndoor leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.\n`But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at\nonce.'  And in she went.\n\n  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the\nlittle glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' she\nsaid to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and\nunlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to\nwork nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her\npocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the\nlittle passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the\nbeautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\nfountains.\n\n\n\n                          CHAPTER VIII\n\n                   The Queen's Croquet-Ground\n\n\n  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the\nroses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at\nit, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious\nthing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up\nto them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go\nsplashing paint over me like that!'\n\n  `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged\nmy elbow.'\n\n  On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always\nlay the blame on others!'\n\n  `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'\n\n  `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.\n\n  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.\n\n  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it\nwas for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'\n\n  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all\nthe unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as\nshe stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the\nothers looked round also, and all of them bowed low.\n\n  `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are\npainting those roses?'\n\n  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a\nlow voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to\nhave been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;\nand if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads\ncut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore\nshe comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously\nlooking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'\nand the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon\ntheir faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice\nlooked round, eager to see the Queen.\n\n  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped\nlike the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and\nfeet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were\nornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\nsoldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were\nten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand\nin hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next\ncame the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\nrecognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\nmanner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\nnoticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\nKing's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n\n  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\nher face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember\nevery having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,\nwhat would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people\nhad all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see\nit?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.\n\n  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped\nand looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'\nShe said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in\nreply.\n\n  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,\nturning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'\n\n  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very\npolitely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of\ncards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'\n\n  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three\ngardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as\nthey were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs\nwas the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether\nthey were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her\nown children.\n\n  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.\n`It's no business of MINE.'\n\n  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her\nfor a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!\nOff--'\n\n  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the\nQueen was silent.\n\n  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said\n`Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'\n\n  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave\n`Turn them over!'\n\n  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n\n  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the\nthree gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the\nKing, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\n\n  `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'\nAnd then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you\nbeen doing here?'\n\n  `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,\ngoing down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'\n\n  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the\nroses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,\nthree of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate\ngardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\n\n  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a\nlarge flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered\nabout for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly\nmarched off after the others.\n\n  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\n\n  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers\nshouted in reply.\n\n  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'\n\n  The soldiers were silent,", "duration_ms": 52996}

Prior memory (from earlier chunks):
 nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
`Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
`It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,
there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper
as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set
of verses.'
`Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of
they jurymen.
`No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the
queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)
`He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.
(The jury all brightened up again.)
`Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and
they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'
`If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the
matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd
have signed your name like an honest man.'
There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day.
`That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
`It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't
even know what they're about!'
`Read them,' said the King.
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?' he asked.
`Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on
till you come to the end:  then stop.'
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
`They told me you had been to her,
And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
But said I could not swim.
He sent them word I had not gone
(We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
What would become of you?
I gave her one, they gave him two,
You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
Though they were mine before.
If I or she should chance to be
Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
Exactly as we were.
My notion was that you had been
(Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
Him, and ourselves, and it.
Don't let him know she liked them best,
For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
Between yourself and me.'
`That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'
said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'
`If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit
afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't
believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'
The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe
there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to
explain the paper.
`If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a
world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And
yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his
knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some
meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you
can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.
The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.
(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)
`All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's
the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,
that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'
`But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said
Alice.
`Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to
the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my
dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.
`Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
`Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round
the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.
`It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and
everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the
King said, for about the twentieth time that day.
`No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
`Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having
the sentence first!'
`Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.
`I won't!' said Alice.
`Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
Nobody moved.
`Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full
size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face.
`Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long
sleep you've had!'
`Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and
when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a
curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's
getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sister's dream.
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's
slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle.
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-
bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
heavy sobs.
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about
her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
THE END


Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):
 this last remark.

  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'

  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse
go on for some time without interrupting it.

  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and
rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew
all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'

  `Why with an M?' said Alice.

  `Why not?' said the March Hare.

  Alice was silent.

  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going
off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up
again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an
M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'

  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I
don't think--'

  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.

  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got
up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep
instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her
going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that
they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she
picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I
ever was at in all my life!'

  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a
door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.
`But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at
once.'  And in she went.

  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the
little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' she
said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and
unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to
work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her
pocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the
little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the
beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool
fountains.



                          CHAPTER VIII

                   The Queen's Croquet-Ground


  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the
roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at
it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go
splashing paint over me like that!'

  `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged
my elbow.'

  On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always
lay the blame on others!'

  `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'

  `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.

  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.

  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it
was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'

  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all
the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as
she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the
others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.

  `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are
painting those roses?'

  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a
low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to
have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;
and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads
cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore
she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously
looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice
looked round, eager to see the Queen.

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped
like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and
feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the
soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were
ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice
recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the
King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on
her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember
every having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,
what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people
had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see
it?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.

  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped
and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'
She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in
reply.

  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,
turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'

  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very
politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of
cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'

  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as
they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs
was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether
they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her
own children.

  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
`It's no business of MINE.'

  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her
for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!
Off--'

  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the
Queen was silent.

  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said
`Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'

  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave
`Turn them over!'
