│  Tool Args: {'ready': False, 'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL       │
│  Perspective):** The primary goal is to minimize future token prediction    │
│  entropy by providing the exact, verbatim continuation of the given text    │
│  prefix from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland". This directly translates  │
│  to providing the most informative context possible, effectively reducing   │
│  the uncertainty of upcoming tokens to near zero. The cost of this          │
│  information retrieval is measured by the tool usage.\n\n2. **Key           │
│  Steps:**\n    *   **Identify Source:** Confirm the text is from "Alice\'s  │
│  Adventures in Wonderland".\n    *   **Locate File:** Search the            │
│  designated `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory for the source         │
│  document.\n    *   **Extract Prefix:** Find the exact provided prefix      │
│  within the identified document.\n    *   **Extract Continuation:**         │
│  Extract the immediate 100-200 words following the prefix.\n    *           │
│  **Format Output:** Present the extracted continuation as plain text,       │
│  without any additional formatting or commentary.\n\n3. **Approach          │
│  Challenges:**\n    *   **File Identification:** The                        │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory might contain multiple files. I   │
│  will use `list_directory` to survey the contents and then                  │
│  `search_files_content` with a precise query to pinpoint the correct        │
│  file.\n    *   **Exact Prefix Matching:** Minor variations in text (e.g.,  │
│  punctuation, capitalization) between the provided prefix and the source    │
│  document could hinder an exact match. I will use a robust part of the      │
│  prefix for searching to maximize the chance of a direct hit.\n    *        │
│  **Continuation Length:** I need to ensure the extracted text is within     │
│  the 100-200 word range. This will involve splitting the text into words    │
│  and selecting the appropriate number.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    │
│  *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To verify the accessible directory   │
│  and confirm operational scope.\n    *                                      │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: To get an     │
│  initial overview of the files present in the sink directory, which might   │
│  help in guessing the filename (e.g., "alice.txt", "wonderland.pdf").\n     │
│  *   **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',         │
│  query=\'Very true,\' said the Duchess: \'flamingoes and mustard both       │
│  bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds"\')`**: This is the most critical   │
│  step. I will use the exact ending of the provided prefix as the query to   │
│  find the file containing this specific text. This ensures high precision   │
│  in locating the source.\n    *                                             │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`**: Once                     │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, I will use this tool to read   │
│  the entire content of that file.\n    *   **Python String Manipulation     │
│  (built-in):** After reading the file content, I will use Python\'s         │
│  `find()` method to locate the exact position of the prefix. Then, I will   │
│  use string slicing to extract the text immediately following the prefix.   │
│  Finally, I will split this extracted text into words and select the first  │
│  100-200 words to form the continuation.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:**\n      │
│  The expected outcome is a block of plain text, approximately 100-200       │
│  words long, representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix  │
│  from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland". This output will directly        │
│  contribute to minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the  │
│  exact sequence of tokens, thereby achieving the core objective of          │

│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │

│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │

│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │

│  of settling all difficulties, great or small. `Off with his head!' she     │
│  said, without even looking round.                                          │
│  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he         │
│  hurried off.                                                               │
│  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going    │
│  on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with         │
│  passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be     │
│  executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of   │
│  things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew       │
│  whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.     │
│  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,                 │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│    `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was             │
│  mouth enough for it to speak with.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no          │
│  use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at          │
│  least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,            │
│  and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the          │
│  game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The             │
│  Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and          │
│  no more of it appeared.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather          │
│  a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't          │
│  hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in               │
│  particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and            │
│  you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;             │
│  for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next                 │
│  walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have            │
│  croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it          │

│                                                                             │
│    `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then             │
│  she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so            │
│  she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while                │
│  finishing the game.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen smiled and passed on.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and          │
│  looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me          │
│  to introduce it.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:  `however,          │
│  it may kiss my hand if it likes.'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me             │
│  like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in              │
│  some book, but I don't remember where.'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and            │
│  he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I           │
│  wish you would have this cat removed!'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great           │
│  or small.  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking             │
│  round.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and          │
│  he hurried off.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game            │
│  was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,              │
│  screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three          │
│  of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and           │
│  she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in             │
│  such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or              │
│  not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,               │
│  which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one          │
│  of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her                 │
│  flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where            │
│  Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up              │
│  into a tree.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,             │
│  the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:              │
│  `but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches            │
│  are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away             │
│  under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for           │
│  a little more conversation with her friend.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to              │
│  find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute          │
│  going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who             │
│  were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,            │
│  and looked very uncomfortable.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to           │
│  settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,             │
│  though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed           │
│  to make out exactly what they said.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a              │
│  head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had              │
│  never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin          │
│  at HIS time of life.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be          │
│  beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about            │
│  it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.          │
│  (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so             │
│  grave and anxious.)                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the          │
│  Duchess:  you'd better ask HER about it.'                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `fetch            │
│  her here.'  And the executioner went off like an arrow.                    │
│                                                                             │
│     The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,           │
│  by the time he had come back with the Dutchess, it had entirely            │
│  disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and             │
│  down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.    │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │

│    `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old            │
│  thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately             │
│  into Alice's, and they walked off together.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and           │
│  thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had            │
│  made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very                │
│  hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT            │
│  ALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that           │
│  makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at              │
│  having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them          │
│  sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar           │
│  and such things that make children sweet-tempered.  I only wish            │
│  people knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you           │
│  know--'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a              │
│  little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.                 │
│  `You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you              │
│  forget to talk.  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that          │
│  is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a                │
│  moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up              │
│  closer to Alice's side as she spoke.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,                 │
│  because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was           │
│  exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,           │
│  and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not              │
│  like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of             │
│  keeping up the conversation a little.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral of that is--"Oh,            │
│  'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody           │
│  minding their own business!'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,             │
│  digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,          │
│  `and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the                │
│  sounds will take care of themselves."'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to          │
│  herself.                                                                   │

│    `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your           │
│  waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm          │
│  doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the               │
│  experiment?'                                                               │

│    `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all            │
│  anxious to have the experiment tried.                                      │

│    `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both             │
│  bite.  And the moral of that is--"Birds                                    │

│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The primary goal is to     │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim  │
│  continuation of the given text prefix from "Alice's Adventures in          │
│  Wonderland". This directly translates to providing the most informative    │
│  context possible, effectively reducing the uncertainty of upcoming tokens  │
│  to near zero. The cost of this information retrieval is measured by the    │
│  tool usage.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   **Identify Source:** Confirm the text is from "Alice's Adventures  │
│  in Wonderland".                                                            │
│      *   **Locate File:** Search the designated                             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory for the source document.          │
│      *   **Extract Prefix:** Find the exact provided prefix within the      │
│  identified document.                                                       │
│      *   **Extract Continuation:** Extract the immediate 100-200 words      │
│  following the prefix.                                                      │
│      *   **Format Output:** Present the extracted continuation as plain     │
│  text, without any additional formatting or commentary.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      *   **File Identification:** The `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`        │
│  directory might contain multiple files. I will use `list_directory` to     │
│  survey the contents and then `search_files_content` with a precise query   │
│  to pinpoint the correct file.                                              │
│      *   **Exact Prefix Matching:** Minor variations in text (e.g.,         │
│  punctuation, capitalization) between the provided prefix and the source    │
│  document could hinder an exact match. I will use a robust part of the      │
│  prefix for searching to maximize the chance of a direct hit.               │
│      *   **Continuation Length:** I need to ensure the extracted text is    │
│  within the 100-200 word range. This will involve splitting the text into   │
│  words and selecting the appropriate number.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To verify the accessible         │
│  directory and confirm operational scope.                                   │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get  │
│  an initial overview of the files present in the sink directory, which      │
│  might help in guessing the filename (e.g., "alice.txt",                    │
│  "wonderland.pdf").                                                         │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite.    │
│  And the moral of that is--"Birds"')`**: This is the most critical step. I  │
│  will use the exact ending of the provided prefix as the query to find the  │
│  file containing this specific text. This ensures high precision in         │
│  locating the source.                                                       │
│      *   **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`**: Once               │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, I will use this tool to read   │
│  the entire content of that file.                                           │
│      *   **Python String Manipulation (built-in):** After reading the file  │
│  content, I will use Python's `find()` method to locate the exact position  │
│  of the prefix. Then, I will use string slicing to extract the text         │
│  immediately following the prefix. Finally, I will split this extracted     │
│  text into words and select the first 100-200 words to form the             │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:**                                                   │
│      The expected outcome is a block of plain text, approximately 100-200   │
│  words long, representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix  │
│  from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". This output will directly         │
│  contribute to minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the  │
│  exact sequence of tokens, thereby achieving the core objective of          │
│  Predictive Compression Intelligence.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The   │
│  primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing   │
│  the exact, verbatim continuation of the given text prefix from "Alice\'s   │
│  Adventures in Wonderland". This directly translates to providing the most  │
│  informative context possible, effectively reducing the uncertainty of      │
│  upcoming tokens to near zero. The cost of this information retrieval is    │
│  measured by the tool usage.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    *   **Identify       │
│  Source:** Confirm the text is from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland".    │
│  (Already confirmed by the prefix content and prior memory).\n    *         │
│  **Locate File:** Search the designated `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`      │
│  directory for the source document.\n    *   **Extract Prefix:** Find the   │
│  exact provided prefix within the identified document.\n    *   **Extract   │
│  Continuation:** Extract the immediate 100-200 words following the          │
│  prefix.\n    *   **Format Output:** Present the extracted continuation as  │
│  plain text, without any additional formatting or commentary.\n\n3.         │
│  **Approach Challenges:**\n    *   **File Identification:** The             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory might contain multiple files. I   │
│  will use `list_directory` to survey the contents and then                  │
│  `search_files_content` with a precise query to pinpoint the correct        │
│  file.\n    *   **Exact Prefix Matching:** Minor variations in text (e.g.,  │
│  punctuation, capitalization) between the provided prefix and the source    │
│  document could hinder an exact match. I will use a robust part of the      │
│  prefix for searching to maximize the chance of a direct hit.\n    *        │
│  **Continuation Length:** I need to ensure the extracted text is within     │
│  the 100-200 word range. This will involve splitting the text into words    │
│  and selecting the appropriate number.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    │
│  *   **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: To get    │
│  an initial overview of the files present in the sink directory, which      │
│  might help in guessing the filename (e.g., "alice.txt",                    │
│  "wonderland.pdf").\n    *                                                  │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'Very true,\' said the Duchess: \'flamingoes and mustard both       │
│  bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds\')`**: This is the most critical    │
│  step. I will use the exact ending of the provided prefix as the query to   │
│  find the file containing this specific text. This ensures high precision   │
│  in locating the source.\n    *                                             │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`**: Once                     │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, I will use this tool to read   │
│  the entire content of that file.\n    *   **Python String Manipulation     │
│  (built-in):** After reading the file content, I will use Python\'s         │
│  `find()` method to locate the exact position of the prefix. Then, I will   │
│  use string slicing to extract the text immediately following the prefix.   │
│  Finally, I will split this extracted text into words and select the first  │
│  100-200 words to form the continuation.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:**\n      │
│  The expected outcome is a block of plain text, approximately 100-200       │
│  words long, representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix  │
│  from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland". This output will directly        │
│  contribute to minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the  │
│  exact sequence of tokens, thereby achieving the core objective of          │

│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │

│  of settling all difficulties, great or small. `Off with his head!' she     │
│  said, without even looking round.                                          │
│  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he         │
│  hurried off.                                                               │
│  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going    │
│  on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with         │
│  passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be     │
│  executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of   │
│  things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew       │
│  whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.     │
│  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,                 │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│    `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was             │
│  mouth enough for it to speak with.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no          │
│  use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at          │
│  least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,            │
│  and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the          │
│  game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The             │
│  Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and          │
│  no more of it appeared.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather          │
│  a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't          │
│  hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in               │
│  particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and            │
│  you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;             │
│  for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next                 │
│  walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have            │
│  croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it          │
│  saw mine coming!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then             │
│  she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so            │
│  she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while                │
│  finishing the game.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen smiled and passed on.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and          │
│  looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me          │
│  to introduce it.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:  `however,          │
│  it may kiss my hand if it likes.'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me             │
│  like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in              │
│  some book, but I don't remember where.'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and            │
│  he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I           │
│  wish you would have this cat removed!'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great           │
│  or small.  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking             │
│  round.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and          │
│  he hurried off.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game            │
│  was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,              │
│  screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three          │
│  of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and           │
│  she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in             │
│  such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or              │
│  not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,               │
│  which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one          │
│  of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her                 │
│  flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where            │
│  Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up              │
│  into a tree.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,             │
│  the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:              │
│  `but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches            │
│  are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away             │
│  under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for           │
│  a little more conversation with her friend.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to              │
│  find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute          │
│  going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who             │
│  were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,            │
│  and looked very uncomfortable.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to           │
│  settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,             │
│  though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed           │
│  to make out exactly what they said.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a              │
│  head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had              │
│  never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin          │
│  at HIS time of life.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be          │
│  beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about            │
│  it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.          │
│  (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so             │
│  grave and anxious.)                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the          │
│  Duchess:  you'd better ask HER about it.'                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `fetch            │
│  her here.'  And the executioner went off like an arrow.                    │
│                                                                             │
│     The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,           │
│  by the time he had come back with the Dutchess, it had entirely            │
│  disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and             │
│  down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.    │
│                                                                             │

│    `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old            │
│  thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately             │
│  into Alice's, and they walked off together.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and           │
│  thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had            │
│  made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very                │
│  hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT            │
│  ALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that           │
│  makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at              │
│  having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them          │
│  sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar           │
│  and such things that make children sweet-tempered.  I only wish            │
│  people knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you           │
│  know--'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a              │
│  little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.                 │
│  `You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you              │
│  forget to talk.  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that          │
│  is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a                │
│  moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up              │
│  closer to Alice's side as she spoke.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,                 │
│  because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was           │
│  exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,           │
│  and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not              │
│  like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of             │
│  keeping up the conversation a little.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral of that is--"Oh,            │
│  'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody           │
│  minding their own business!'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,             │
│  digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,          │
│  `and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the                │
│  sounds will take care of themselves."'                                     │

│    `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to          │
│  herself.                                                                   │

│    `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your           │
│  waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm          │
│  doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the               │
│  experiment?'                                                               │

│    `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all            │
│  anxious to have the experiment tried.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both             │
│  bite.  And the moral of that is--"Birds                                    │

│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The primary goal is to     │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim  │
│  continuation of the given text prefix from "Alice's Adventures in          │
│  Wonderland". This directly translates to providing the most informative    │
│  context possible, effectively reducing the uncertainty of upcoming tokens  │
│  to near zero. The cost of this information retrieval is measured by the    │
│  tool usage.                                                                │

│      *   **Extract Prefix:** Find the exact provided prefix within the      │
│  identified document.                                                       │
│      *   **Extract Continuation:** Extract the immediate 100-200 words      │
│  following the prefix.                                                      │
│      *   **Format Output:** Present the extracted continuation as plain     │
│  text, without any additional formatting or commentary.                     │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      *   **File Identification:** The `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`        │
│  directory might contain multiple files. I will use `list_directory` to     │
│  survey the contents and then `search_files_content` with a precise query   │
│  to pinpoint the correct file.                                              │
│      *   **Exact Prefix Matching:** Minor variations in text (e.g.,         │
│  punctuation, capitalization) between the provided prefix and the source    │
│  document could hinder an exact match. I will use a robust part of the      │
│  prefix for searching to maximize the chance of a direct hit.               │
│      *   **Continuation Length:** I need to ensure the extracted text is    │
│  within the 100-200 word range. This will involve splitting the text into   │
│  words and selecting the appropriate number.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To verify the accessible         │
│  directory and confirm operational scope.                                   │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get  │
│  an initial overview of the files present in the sink directory, which      │
│  might help in guessing the filename (e.g., "alice.txt",                    │
│  "wonderland.pdf").                                                         │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite.    │
│  And the moral of that is--"Birds"')`**: This is the most critical step. I  │
│  will use the exact ending of the provided prefix as the query to find the  │
│  file containing this specific text. This ensures high precision in         │
│  locating the source.                                                       │
│      *   **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`**: Once               │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, I will use this tool to read   │
│  the entire content of that file.                                           │
│      *   **Python String Manipulation (built-in):** After reading the file  │
│  content, I will use Python's `find()` method to locate the exact position  │
│  of the prefix. Then, I will use string slicing to extract the text         │
│  immediately following the prefix. Finally, I will split this extracted     │
│  text into words and select the first 100-200 words to form the             │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:**                                                   │
│      The expected outcome is a block of plain text, approximately 100-200   │
│  words long, representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix  │
│  from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". This output will directly         │
│  contribute to minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the  │
│  exact sequence of tokens, thereby achieving the core objective of          │
│  Predictive Compression Intelligence.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The primary goal is to     │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim  │
│  continuation of the given text prefix from "Alice's Adventures in          │
│  Wonderland". This directly translates to providing the most informative    │
│  context possible, effectively reducing the uncertainty of upcoming tokens  │
│  to near zero. The cost of this information retrieval is measured by the    │
│  tool usage.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   **Identify Source:** Confirm the text is from "Alice's Adventures  │
│  in Wonderland". (Already confirmed by the prefix content and prior         │
│  memory).                                                                   │
│      *   **Locate File:** Search the designated                             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory for the source document.          │
│      *   **Extract Prefix:** Find the exact provided prefix within the      │
│  identified document.                                                       │
│      *   **Extract Continuation:** Extract the immediate 100-200 words      │
│  following the prefix.                                                      │
│      *   **Format Output:** Present the extracted continuation as plain     │
│  text, without any additional formatting or commentary.                     │
│                                                                             │
