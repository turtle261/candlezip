│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. Understanding of the Task: The      │
│  primary objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy by        │
│  providing the exact immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the given    │
│  text prefix. This requires identifying the source document and extracting  │
│  the verbatim text. The context strongly suggests "Alice\'s Adventures in   │
│  Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.\n\n2. Key Steps:\n    a. Confirm the         │
│  accessible directory using `list_allowed_directories`.\n    b. Search for  │
│  a unique phrase from the end of the provided prefix within the allowed     │
│  directory to pinpoint the exact source file.\n    c. Once the file is      │
│  identified, read its content from the point of the found phrase to         │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    d. Output the extracted         │
│  continuation as plain text.\n\n3. Approach to Challenges:\n    a. If the   │
│  initial search phrase yields no results, I will shorten the phrase or      │
│  select a different, equally distinctive sentence from the end of the       │
│  prefix to broaden the search.\n    b. If no source document is found       │
│  after multiple attempts, I will resort to generating a contextually        │
│  relevant continuation, prioritizing accuracy and adherence to the          │
│  established narrative style. However, given the nature of the text,        │
│  finding the source is highly probable.\n\n4. Strategic Tool Usage:\n       │
│  a. `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path, although  │
│  it\'s already specified as `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink ONLY`. This is a  │
│  preliminary check.\n    b.                                                 │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had  │
│  put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving     │
│  its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.\')`: This  │
│  is the core tool for locating the specific file containing the prefix.     │
│  The query is a highly specific sentence from the end of the prefix to      │
│  ensure an exact match.\n    c.                                             │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'[found_file_path]\')`: Once the file is             │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read its content. I will then        │
│  programmatically extract the text following the identified phrase.\n\n5.   │
│  Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a plain text output containing   │
│  the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix, approximately 100-200    │
│  words long. This will directly contribute to entropy reduction by          │
│  providing precise, information-dense tokens that the language model can    │
│  predict with high confidence. The output will be free of any formatting,   │
│  analysis, or commentary, as per the task requirements.\n'}                 │

│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │

│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:75                                                                 │
│  of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!'                 │
│  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse    │
│  turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had     │
│  disappeared.                                                               │
│  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. `Call the next   │
│  witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, `Really, my dear,     │
│  YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead        │
│  ache!'                                                                     │
│  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very   │
│  curious to see what the next witness would be like, `--for they haven't    │
│  got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when    │
│  the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the      │
│  name `Alice!'                                                              │
│                                                                             │

│  begin?'                                                                    │

│    The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into           │
│  the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.  `Fourteenth of March, I          │
│  think it was,' he said.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury               │
│  eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then               │
│  added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who                   │
│  instantly made a memorandum of the fact.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;               │
│  `I've none of my own.  I'm a hatter.'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the           │
│  Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or           │
│  I'll have you executed on the spot.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept              │
│  shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the               │
│  Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his                │
│  teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which           │
│  puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she was           │
│  beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she               │
│  would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she               │
│  decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for              │
│  her.                                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was             │
│  sitting next to her.  `I can hardly breathe.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly:  `you know                │
│  you're growing too.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:               │
│  `not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily              │
│  and crossed over to the other side of the court.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the                │
│  Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to           │
│  one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the                │
│  singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter                 │
│  trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have           │
│  you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a                   │
│  trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week            │
│  or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and             │
│  the twinkling of the tea--'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.            │
│  `Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on!'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things                   │
│  twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `You did!' said the Hatter.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I deny it!' said the March Hare.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,             │
│  looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the           │
│  Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-              │
│  and-butter--'                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you                │
│  executed.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,            │
│  and went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he             │
│  began.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately                 │
│  suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a             │
│  hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had           │
│  a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:               │
│  into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat            │
│  upon it.)                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often           │
│  read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some              │
│  attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the              │
│  officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant               │
│  till now.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'                   │
│  continued the King.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as           │
│  it is.'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.  `Now we           │
│  shall get on better.'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious             │
│  look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the           │
│  court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one           │
│  of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the               │
│  officer could get to the door.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Call the next witness!' said the King.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the                │
│  pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before          │
│  she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began          │
│  sneezing all at once.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' said the King.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Shan't,' said the cook.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a             │
│  low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy              │
│  air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till             │
│  his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What          │
│  are tarts made of?'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that            │
│  Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch          │
│  him!  Off with his whiskers!'                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the           │
│  Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down                │
│  again, the cook had disappeared.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.                │
│  `Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the              │
│  Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.          │
│  It quite makes my forehead ache!'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,              │
│  feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,           │
│  `--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.           │
│  Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top           │
│  of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'                              │

│  the week before.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great                │
│  dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,           │
│  for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and             │
│  she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once           │
│  and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.                         │
│                                                                             │

│  ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as            │
│  he said do.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she            │
│  had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing            │
│  was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable          │
│  to move.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understanding of the Task: The primary objective is to minimize future  │
│  token prediction entropy by providing the exact immediate continuation     │
│  (100-200 words) of the given text prefix. This requires identifying the    │
│  source document and extracting the verbatim text. The context strongly     │
│  suggests "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.              │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      a. Confirm the accessible directory using `list_allowed_directories`.  │
│      b. Search for a unique phrase from the end of the provided prefix      │
│  within the allowed directory to pinpoint the exact source file.            │
│      c. Once the file is identified, read its content from the point of     │
│  the found phrase to extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                  │
│      d. Output the extracted continuation as plain text.                    │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach to Challenges:                                                 │
│      a. If the initial search phrase yields no results, I will shorten the  │
│  phrase or select a different, equally distinctive sentence from the end    │
│  of the prefix to broaden the search.                                       │
│      b. If no source document is found after multiple attempts, I will      │
│  resort to generating a contextually relevant continuation, prioritizing    │
│  accuracy and adherence to the established narrative style. However, given  │
│  the nature of the text, finding the source is highly probable.             │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      a. `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible path,       │
│  although it's already specified as `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink ONLY`.    │
│  This is a preliminary check.                                               │
│      b. `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',          │
│  query='Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had   │
│  put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving     │
│  its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.')`: This   │
│  is the core tool for locating the specific file containing the prefix.     │
│  The query is a highly specific sentence from the end of the prefix to      │
│  ensure an exact match.                                                     │
│      c. `read_text_file(path='[found_file_path]')`: Once the file is        │
│  identified, this tool will be used to read its content. I will then        │
│  programmatically extract the text following the identified phrase.         │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a plain text output           │
│  containing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix,               │
│  approximately 100-200 words long. This will directly contribute to         │
│  entropy reduction by providing precise, information-dense tokens that the  │
│  language model can predict with high confidence. The output will be free   │
│  of any formatting, analysis, or commentary, as per the task requirements.  │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
