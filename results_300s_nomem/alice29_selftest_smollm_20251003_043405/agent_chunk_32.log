│  added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.' `Are they in   │
│  the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of they jurymen. `No, they're   │
│  not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the queerest thing about it.'     │
│  (The jury all looked puzzled.) `He must have imitated somebody else's      │
│  hand,' said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) `Please your     │
│  Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and they can't prove I did:  │
│  there's no name signed at the end.' `If you didn't sign it,' said the      │
│  King, `that only makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some          │
│  mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.' There   │
│  was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever    │
│  thing the King had said that day. `That PROVES his guilt,' said the        │
│  Queen. `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't even   │
│  know what they're about!' `Read them,' said the King. The White Rabbit     │
│  put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he      │
│  asked. `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on till    │
│  you come to the end: then stop.' These were the verses the White Rabbit    │
│  read:-- `They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She    │
│  gave me a good character, But said I could not swim. He sent them word I   │
│  had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on,    │
│  What would become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us   │
│  three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine    │
│  before. If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He        │
│  trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were. My notion was that     │
│  you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him,  │
│  and ourselves, and it. Don't let him know she liked them best, For this    │
│  must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.'   │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the    │
│  King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--' `If any one of them can   │
│  explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes   │
│  that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him          │
│  sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.' The jury    │
│  all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of    │
│  meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper. `If       │
│  there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a world of trouble,  │
│  you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,' he went    │
│  on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one     │
│  eye; `I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT   │
│  SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave. The      │
│  Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he        │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) `All right, so       │
│  far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself:  │
│  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE,   │
│  THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you     │
│  know--' `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said        │
│  Alice. `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the  │
│  tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then                │
│  again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?'  │
│  he said to the Queen. `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an       │
│  inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had      │
│  left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no      │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling    │
│  down his face, as long as it lasted.) `Then the words don't FIT you,'      │
│  said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead      │
│  silence. `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody   │
│  laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about   │
│  the twentieth time that day. `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence           │
│  first--verdict afterwards.' `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The  │
│  idea of having the sentence first!' `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen,    │
│  turning purple. `I won't!' said Alice. `Off with her head!' the Queen      │
│  shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. `Who cares for you?' said   │
│  Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) `You're nothing but  │
│  a pack of cards!' At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came    │
│  flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half    │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the       │
│  bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing      │
│  away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her      │
│  face. `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep      │
│  you've had!' `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she      │
│  told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange     │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she     │
│  had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream,    │
│  dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice  │
│  got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a      │
│  wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left     │
│  her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking  │
│  of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began       │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of  │
│  little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her  │
│  knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear  │
│  the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head    │
│  to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and   │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her     │
│  became alive the strange creatures of her little sister's dream. The long  │
│  grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened   │
│  Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the   │
│  rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their       │
│  never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her      │
│  unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on    │
│  the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more   │
│  the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil,     │
│  and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up    │
│  with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. So she sat on, with    │
│  closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she  │
│  had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the      │
│  grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the     │
│  waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-  │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and  │
│  the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all thy other       │
│  queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy  │
│  farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the   │
│  place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself     │
│  how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself   │
│  a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the    │
│  simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about   │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many  │
│  a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago:     │
│  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure  │
│  in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy    │
│  summer days. THE END                                                       │

│      Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--                      │
│        Pray, what is the reason of that?'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│      `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,              │
│        `I kept all my limbs very supple                                     │
│      By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--                    │
│        Allow me to sell you a couple?'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│      `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak             │
│        For anything tougher than suet;                                      │
│      Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--              │
│        Pray how did you manage to do it?'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│      `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,                    │
│        And argued each case with my wife;                                   │
│      And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,                    │
│        Has lasted the rest of my life.'                                     │

│      `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose               │
│        That your eye was as steady as ever;                                 │
│      Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--                      │
│        What made you so awfully clever?'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│      `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'                 │
│        Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!                          │
│      Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?                       │
│        Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'                               │
│                                                                             │

│    `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the         │
│  words have got altered.'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar                │
│  decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The Caterpillar was the first to speak.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `What size do you want to be?' it asked.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;              │
│  `only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in          │
│  her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you                  │
│  wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched              │
│  height to be.'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar                  │
│  angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three          │
│  inches high).                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.          │
│  And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so           │
│  easily offended!'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it            │
│  put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.          │
│  In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its              │
│  mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got             │
│  down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely               │
│  remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and             │
│  the other side will make you grow shorter.'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to            │
│  herself.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had              │
│  asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a                │
│  minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as          │
│  it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.          │
│  However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they            │
│  would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a             │
│  little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment           │
│  she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her            │
│  foot!                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but           │
│  she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking           │
│  rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.          │
│  Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was           │
│  hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and                 │
│  managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.                           │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                     │
│                                                                             │
│           *       *       *       *       *       *                         │
│                                                                             │
│       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of                  │
│  delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she              │
│  found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could          │
│  see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which            │
│  seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay          │
│  far below her.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.  `And where              │
│  HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I              │
│  can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no            │
│  result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the                 │
│  distant green leaves.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her           │
│  head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted            │
│  to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,            │
│  like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a          │
│  graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which          │
│  she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she          │
│  had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a              │
│  hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating            │
│  her violently with its wings.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more               │
│  subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every              │
│  way, and nothing seems to suit them!'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said               │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've           │
│  tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but          │
│  those serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no            │
│  use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the             │
│  Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and              │
│  day!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'               │

│    `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was                │

│    `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can see you're               │
│  trying to invent something!'                                               │

│    `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she            │
│  remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.            │
│                                                                             │
│    `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the                │
│  deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my               │
│  time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a           │
│  serpent; and there's no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be               │
│  telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very              │
│  truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as                │
│  serpents do, you know.'                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why              │
│  then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent             │
│  for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of              │
│  adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and             │
│  what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a                │
│  serpent?'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm             │
│  not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't             │
│  want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it             │
│  settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the           │
│  trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled            │
│  among the branches, and every now and                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Explore the allowed directory:** Use `list_directory` and             │
│  `directory_tree` to identify potential source files within                 │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. I will look for text files that might      │
│  contain classic literature, specifically "Alice's Adventures in            │
│  Wonderland".                                                               │
│  2. **Locate the prefix:** Use `search_files_content` with a distinctive    │
│  part of the provided prefix (e.g., "said the youth, `as I mentioned        │
│  before,") to find the exact file and line number where the prefix occurs.  │
│  This is critical for precise continuation.                                 │
│  3. **Extract the continuation:** Once the file and starting position are   │
│  identified, use `read_text_file` to read the content immediately           │
│  following the prefix. I will read enough lines to ensure I can extract     │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  4. **Format the output:** Carefully extract the next 100-200 words,        │
│  ensuring no markdown, analysis, or commentary is included, and that it is  │
│  purely plain text.                                                         │
│  5. **Handle edge cases:** If the exact source is not found (unlikely       │
│  given the task phrasing), I will generate a contextually relevant          │
│  continuation based on the provided prefix, prioritizing accuracy and       │
│  relevance over creativity, and avoiding generic text.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The task is to find the exact immediate continuation of  │
│  the provided text prefix. I need to use the available tools to locate the  │
│  source document and extract the next 100-200 words verbatim.               │
│  First, I will list the allowed directories to understand my accessible     │
│  scope. Then, I will explore the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory   │
│  for any files that might contain the text. Given the nature of the text    │
│  (classic literature, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"), I'll look for    │
│  `.txt` or similar text files.                                              │

│  to find the exact location of the prefix within those files. A good        │

│  Thought: Thought: The `search_files_content` tool is not finding the       │
│  text, which is very surprising given that the file                         │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt` exists and the text is clearly from that book.   │
│  This suggests there might be an issue with how the `search_files_content`  │
│  tool handles the text, or perhaps a subtle difference in the file's        │
│  content (e.g., encoding, hidden characters, or slight variations in        │
│  wording).                                                                  │
│  Since direct content search is failing, I will try a different approach.   │
│  I will read the entire `alice_in_wonderland.txt` file and then perform     │
│  the search within the retrieved content programmatically. This will allow  │
│  me to be more flexible with the search (e.g., case-insensitive, partial    │
│  matches, or even regex if needed).                                         │
│  First, I'll read the entire file.                                          │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The `list_directory` command in the previous turn        │
│  returned a different set of files than before. It seems the files          │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt` and `war_and_peace.txt` are no longer directly   │
│  in `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. This is a critical change.              │
│  I need to re-evaluate the directory structure. It's possible they are now  │
│  in a subdirectory. I will use `directory_tree` with a `max_depth` to get   │
│  a better overview of the entire `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory   │
│  and its subdirectories.                                                    │

│  `alice29.txt` is the most likely candidate. The `search_files_content`     │

│  differences in whitespace or line endings.                                 │
│  Given that direct content search is proving difficult, I will try to read  │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she          │
│  had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to               │
│  wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look            │
│  down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to           │
│  see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and                │
│  noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;             │
│  here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She              │
│  took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was              │
│  labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it            │
│  was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing           │
│  somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she            │
│  fell past it.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I          │
│  shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll            │
│  all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,              │
│  even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely           │
│  true.)                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I              │
│  wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.           │
│  `I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let            │
│  me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,          │
│  you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her               │
│  lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good             │
│  opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to          │
│  listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,          │
│  that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude           │
│  or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,          │
│  or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to             │
│  say.)                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right              │
│  THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the             │
│  people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I            │
│  think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this             │
│  time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall             │
│  have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.                │
│  Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried           │
│  to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling                │
│  through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what            │
│  an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll             │
│  never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon           │
│  began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I              │
│  should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember             │
│  her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were           │
│  down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but          │
│  you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.             │
│  But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get              │
│  rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of          │
│  way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do             │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either                │
│  question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt            │
│  that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she              │
│  was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very                │
│  earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a             │
│  bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of            │
│  sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a          │
│  moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her           │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:               │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the                │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found                │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;           │
│  and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the               │
│  other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,                │
│  wondering how she was ever to get out again.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of          │
│  solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,             │
│  and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the           │
│  doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or          │
│  the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of            │
│  them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low              │
│  curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little             │
│  door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key           │
│  in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small                 │
│  passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and              │
│  looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.           │
│  How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about              │
│  among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but           │
│  she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if           │
│  my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of             │
│  very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish                      │
│  I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only              │
│  know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things           │
│  had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few           │
│  things indeed were really impossible.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she          │
│  went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on          │
│  it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like             │
│  telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which            │
│  certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck            │
│  of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'                 │
│  beautifully printed on it in large letters.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little              │
│  Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look                 │
│  first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';           │
│  for she had read several nice little histories about children who          │
│  had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant            │
│  things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules               │
│  their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker              │
│  will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your            │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had            │
│  never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked               │
│  `poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or             │
│  later.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured          │
│  to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort            │
│  of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast                │
│  turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished            │
│  it off.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                     │
│                                                                             │
│           *       *       *       *       *       *                         │
│                                                                             │
│       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up             │
│  like a telescope.'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and             │
│  her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right           │
│  size for going though the little door into that lovely garden.             │
│  First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was             │
│  going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about              │
│  this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my          │
│  going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be            │
│  like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is          │
│  like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember             │
│  ever having seen such a thing.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided           │
│  on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when           │
│  she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden          │
│  key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she             │
│  could not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainly               │
│  through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the           │
│  legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had               │
│  tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and          │
│  cried.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to                │
│  herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'          │
│  She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very              │
│  seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so                  │
│  severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered          │
│  trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game            │
│  of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious               │
│  child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no          │
│  use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,          │
│  there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable                   │
│  person!'                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under             │
│  the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on           │
│  which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.              │
│  `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,          │
│  I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep          │
│  under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I              │
│  don't care which happens!'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which              │
│  way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to              │
│  feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to              │
│  find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally          │
│  happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the             │
│  way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,              │
│  that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the              │
│  common way.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.                 │
│                                                                             │

│    `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much                  │
│  surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good          │
│  English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that             │
│  ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her               │
│  feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so          │
│  far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on              │
│  your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't          │
│  be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself            │
│  about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be          │
│  kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the              │
│  way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of               │
│  boots every Christmas.'                                                    │

│    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.             │
│  `They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll           │
│  seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the                 │
│  directions will look!                                                      │

│    Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in              │
│  fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took            │
│  up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.               │
│                                                                             │
│    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one           │
│  side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get             │
│  through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to            │
│  cry again.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great              │
│  girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in             │
│  this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all             │
│  the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool          │
│  all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the           │
│  hall.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the                 │
│  distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.           │
│  It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a              │
│  pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the                │
│  other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to              │
│  himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she           │
│  be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate              │
│  that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit             │
│  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,           │
│  sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid                │
│  gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard            │
│  as he could go.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very              │
│  hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:            │
│  `Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday               │
│  things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in            │
│  the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this               │
│  morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little                   │
│  different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in          │
│  the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began              │
│  thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age          │
│  as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of               │
│  them.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such             │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm             │
│  sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,            │
│  oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,          │
│  and--oh dear,then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she        │
│  remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and    │
│  she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the      │
│  other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had   │
│  succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.                    │
│                                                                             │
│  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it    │
│  felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and  │
│  began talking to herself, as usual. `Come, there's half my plan done now!  │
│  How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be,   │
│  from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right size: the   │
│  next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done,  │
│  I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a  │
│  little house in it about four feet high. `Whoever lives there,' thought    │
│  Alice, `it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should          │
│  frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand   │
│  bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought   │
│  herself down to nine inches high.                                          │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she          │
│  had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to               │
│  wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look            │
│  down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to           │
│  see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and                │
│  noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;             │
│  here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She              │
│  took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was              │
│  labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it            │
│  was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing           │
│  somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she            │
│  fell past it.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I          │
│  shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll            │
│  all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,              │
│  even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely           │
│  true.)                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I              │
│  wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.           │
│  `I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let            │
│  me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,          │
│  you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her               │
│  lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good             │
│  opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to          │
│  listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,          │
│  that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude           │
│  or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,          │
│  or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to             │
│  say.)                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right              │
│  THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the             │
│  people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I            │
│  think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this             │
│  time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall             │
│  have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.                │
│  Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried           │
│  to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling                │
│  through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what            │
│  an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll             │
│  never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon           │
│  began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I              │
│  should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember             │
│  her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were           │
│  down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but          │
│  you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.             │
│  But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get              │
│  rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of          │
│  way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do             │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either                │
│  question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt            │
│  that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she              │
│  was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very                │
│  earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a             │
│  bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of            │
│  sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a          │
│  moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her           │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:               │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the                │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found                │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;           │
│  and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the               │
│  other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,                │
│  wondering how she was ever to get out again.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of          │
│  solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,             │
│  and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the           │
│  doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or          │
│  the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of            │
│  them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low              │
│  curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little             │
│  door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key           │
│  in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small                 │
│  passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and              │
│  looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.           │
│  How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about              │
│  among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but           │
│  she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if           │
│  my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of             │
│  very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish                      │
│  I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only              │
│  know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things           │
│  had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few           │
│  things indeed were really impossible.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she          │
│  went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on          │
│  it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like             │
│  telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which            │
│  certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck            │
│  of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'                 │
│  beautifully printed on it in large letters.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little              │
│  Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look                 │
│  first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';           │
│  for she had read several nice little histories about children who          │
│  had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant            │
│  things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules               │
│  their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker              │
│  will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your            │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had            │
│  never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked               │
│  `poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or             │
│  later.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured          │
│  to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort            │
│  of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast                │
│  turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished            │
│  it off.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                     │
│                                                                             │
│           *       *       *       *       *       *                         │
│                                                                             │
│       *       *       *       *       *       *       *                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up             │
│  like a telescope.'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and             │
│  her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right           │
│  size for going though the little door into that lovely garden.             │
│  First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was             │
│  going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about              │
│  this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my          │
│  going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be            │
│  like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is          │
│  like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember             │
│  ever having seen such a thing.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided           │
│  on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when           │
│  she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden          │
│  key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she             │
│  could not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainly               │
│  through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the           │
│  legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had               │
│  tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and          │
│  cried.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to                │
│  herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'          │
│  She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very              │
│  seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so                  │
│  severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered          │
│  trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game            │
│  of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious               │
│  child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no          │
│  use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,          │
│  there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable                   │
│  person!'                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under             │
│  the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on           │
│  which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.              │
│  `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,          │
│  I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep          │
│  under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I              │
│  don't care which happens!'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which              │
│  way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to              │
│  feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to              │
│  find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally          │
│  happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the             │
│  way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,              │
│  that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the              │
│  common way.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.                 │
│                                                                             │

│    `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much                  │
│  surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good          │
│  English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that             │
│  ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her               │
│  feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so          │
│  far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on              │
│  your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't          │
│  be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself            │
│  about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be          │
│  kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the              │
│  way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of               │
│  boots every Christmas.'                                                    │

│    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.             │
│  `They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll           │
│  seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the                 │
│  directions will look!                                                      │

│  fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took            │
│  up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.               │
│                                                                             │
│    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one           │
│  side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get             │
│  through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to            │
│  cry again.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great              │
│  girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in             │
│  this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all             │
│  the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool          │
│  all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the           │
│  hall.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the                 │
│  distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.           │
│  It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a              │
│  pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the                │
│  other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to              │
│  himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she           │
│  be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate              │
│  that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit             │
│  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,           │
│  sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid                │
│  gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard            │
│  as he could go.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very              │
│  hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:            │
│  `Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday               │
│  things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in            │
│  the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this               │
│  morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little                   │
│  different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in          │
│  the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began              │
│  thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age          │
│  as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of               │
│  them.                                                                      │

Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\n  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\nfalling down a very deep well.\n\n  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\nsee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\nhere and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\nsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\nfell past it.\n\n  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\nshall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\nall think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\neven if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely\ntrue.)\n\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\nme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\nyou see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\nlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\nor Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\nor Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\nsay.)\n\n  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\nTHROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\npeople that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\nhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\nPlease, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\nnever do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n\n  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\nyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\nBut do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\nrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\nquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\nsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\nsight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\naway went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\nsay, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\nhanging from the roof.\n\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\nother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\nwondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\ndoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\nthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\nthem.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\n  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\npassage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\nshe could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\nmy head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\nvery little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\nhad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\nthings indeed were really impossible.\n\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\ntelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\ncertainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\nof the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\n\n  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\nAlice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\nfirst,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\nfor she had read several nice little histories about children who\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\nthings, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\ntheir friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\nwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\nlater.\n\n  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\nto taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\nit off.\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n         *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up\nlike a telescope.'\n\n  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\nher face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\nsize for going though the little door into that lovely garden.\nFirst, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\ngoing to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\nthis; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\ngoing out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be\nlike then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is\nlike after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\never having seen such a thing.\n\n  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\non going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when\nshe got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden\nkey, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she\ncould not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainly\nthrough the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the\nlegs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had\ntired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and\ncried.\n\n  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\nherself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\nShe generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\nseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\nseverely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\ntrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\nof croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\nchild was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\nuse now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,\nthere's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\nperson!'\n\n  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\nthe table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\nwhich the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\n`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\nI can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\nunder the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\ndon't care which happens!'\n\n  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\nway?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\nfeel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\nfind that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally\nhappens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\nthat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the\ncommon way.\n\n  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n         *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n                           CHAPTER II\n\n                        The Pool of Tears\n\n\n  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much\nsurprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good\nEnglish); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that\never was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her\nfeet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so\nfar off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on\nyour shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't\nbe able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself\nabout you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be\nkind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the\nway I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of\nboots every Christmas.'\n\n  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.\n`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll\nseem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the\ndirections will look!\n\n            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\n                HEARTHRUG,\n                    NEAR THE FENDER,\n                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'\n\n  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in\nfact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took\nup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\n\n  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one\nside, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get\nthrough was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to\ncry again.\n\n  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great\ngirl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in\nthis way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all\nthe same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool\nall round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the\nhall.\n\n  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the\ndistance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.\nIt was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a\npair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the\nother:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to\nhimself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she\nbe savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate\nthat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,\nsir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid\ngloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\nas he could go.\n\n  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very\nhot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:\n`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday\nthings went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in\nthe night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this\nmorning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little\ndifferent.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in\nthe world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age\nas herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of\nthem.\n\n  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm\nsure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,\noh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\nand--oh dear,then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. `Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.", "duration_ms": 73032}

                ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

                          Lewis Carroll

               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 2.9




                            CHAPTER I

                      Down the Rabbit-Hole


  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'
thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'

  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again.

  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well.

  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look
down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to
see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was
labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it
was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
fell past it.

  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll
all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,
even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely
true.)

  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I
wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.
`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let
me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,
you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good
opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to
listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,
that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,
or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
say.)

  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right
THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the
people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I
think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this
time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried
to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what
an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll
never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'

  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I
should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember
her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were
down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but
you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.
But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get
rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do
bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either
question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she
was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very
earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a
bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of
sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her
was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:
away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it
say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late
it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the
corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
hanging from the roof.

  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
wondering how she was ever to get out again.

  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the
doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or
the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of
them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
C:\Users\Noah\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\site-packages\litellm\llms\custom_httpx\async_client_cleanup.py:66: DeprecationWarning: There is no current event loop
curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little
  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key
in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if
my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of
very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish
I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only
know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible.

  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she
went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on
it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which
certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck
of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'
beautifully printed on it in large letters.

  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little
Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look
first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';
for she had read several nice little histories about children who
had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules
their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker
will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had
never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or
later.

  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured
to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort
of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished
it off.

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

         *       *       *       *       *       *

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up
like a telescope.'

  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right
size for going though the little door into that lovely garden.
First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was
going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about
this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my
going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be
like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is
like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
ever having seen such a thing.

  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided
on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when
she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden
key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she
could not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainly
through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the
legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had
tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and
cried.

  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to
herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'
She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very
seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so
severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered
trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious
child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no
use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,
there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
person!'

  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on
which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.
`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,
I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I
don't care which happens!'

  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which
way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to
feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to
find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally
happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the
way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
common way.

  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

         *       *       *       *       *       *

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *




                           CHAPTER II

                        The Pool of Tears


  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much
surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that
ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her
feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so
far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't
be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be
kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the
way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of
boots every Christmas.'

  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll
seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the
directions will look!

            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
                HEARTHRUG,
                    NEAR THE FENDER,
                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).

Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'

  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in
fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.

  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one
side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get
through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to
cry again.

  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great
girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in
this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all
the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool
all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the
hall.

  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the
distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she
be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate
that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,
sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid
gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard
as he could go.

  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very
hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:
`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday
things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in
the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this
morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little
different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in
the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of
them.

  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such
long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm
sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,
oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,
and--oh dear,then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. `Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
