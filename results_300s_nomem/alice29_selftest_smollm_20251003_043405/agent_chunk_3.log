│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │

│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │

│  had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what   │
│  was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what  │
│  she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked    │
│  at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with           │
│  cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung  │
│  upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it   │
│  was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was    │
│  empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody       │
│  underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell     │
│  past it.                                                                   │
│  `Well!' thought Alice to herself. `After such a fall as this, I shall      │
│  think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at   │
│  home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top    │
│  of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)                               │
│  Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end? `I wonder how many  │
│  miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. `I must be getting        │
│  somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four     │
│  thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several    │
│  things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though she had   │
│  not much use for them, as there was no opportunity of showing off her      │
│  knowledge anywhere, still it was a nice sort of thing to invent something  │
│  new, and say `Oh, what a clever girl I am!') `I wonder if I shall fall     │
│  right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the        │
│  people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--'    │
│  (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't   │
│  sound at all the right word) `--but I shall have to ask them what the      │
│  name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or    │
│  Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as    │
│  you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And    │
│  what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never   │
│  do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'                   │
│  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began        │
│  talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'      │
│  (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at        │
│  tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no  │
│  mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very    │
│  like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice    │
│  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy     │
│  sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do      │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it   │
│  didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing      │
│  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with    │
│  Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:   │
│  did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon   │
│  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I    │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │

│    Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she          │

│  somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she            │
│  fell past it.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I          │
│  shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll            │
│  all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,              │
│  even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely           │
│  true.)                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I              │
│  wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.           │
│  `I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let            │
│  me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,          │
│  you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her               │
│  lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good             │
│  opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to          │
│  listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,          │
│  that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude           │
│  or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,          │
│  or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to             │
│  say.)                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right              │
│  THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the             │
│  people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I            │
│  think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this             │
│  time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall             │
│  have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.                │
│  Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried           │
│  to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling                │
│  through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what            │
│  an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll             │
│  never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon           │
│  began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I              │
│  should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember             │
│  her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were           │
│  down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but          │
│  you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.             │
│  But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get              │
│  rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of          │
│  way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do             │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either                │
│  question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt            │
│  that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she              │
│  was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very                │
│  earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a             │
│  bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of            │
│  sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a          │
│  moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her           │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still                   │
│                                                                             │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
