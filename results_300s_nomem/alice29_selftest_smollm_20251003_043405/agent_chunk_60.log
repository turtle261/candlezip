│  Compression Intelligence, my objective is to minimize future token         │
│  prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim continuation of the    │
│  given text prefix. The text is clearly from "Alice\'s Adventures in        │
│  Wonderland." Finding the precise continuation will offer the highest       │
│  possible compression gain.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    a. **Directory        │
│  Analysis:** Begin by listing the contents of the allowed directory         │
│  (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to identify potential source files.\n     │
│  b. **Targeted Search:** Use a distinctive phrase from the end of the       │
│  provided prefix to search for the exact source file within the directory.  │
│  This will be more efficient than reading multiple files.\n    c.           │
│  **Content Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, read its full  │
│  content.\n    d. **Continuation Retrieval:** Locate the exact prefix       │
│  within the file and extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.\n       │
│  e. **Output Generation:** Present the extracted text as plain text,        │
│  without any additional formatting or commentary.\n\n3. **Challenge         │
│  Management:**\n    a. **File Not Found:** If the initial search for the    │
│  exact phrase fails, I will broaden my search within the directory for      │
│  keywords related to "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland" (e.g., "Alice",    │
│  "Wonderland", "Mock Turtle", "Gryphon") to locate a likely candidate       │
│  file. If no exact source is found after aggressive tool usage, I will      │
│  generate a contextually relevant continuation as a last resort, as per     │
│  the task instructions.\n    b. **Multiple Matches:** If multiple files     │
│  contain the search phrase, I will examine each to determine which one      │
│  provides the most complete and accurate context for the prefix.\n    c.    │
│  **Length Constraint:** I will ensure the extracted continuation is within  │
│  the 100-200 word range by carefully counting words after the               │
│  prefix.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    a.                            │
│  **`list_allowed_directories()`:** (Implicitly done by knowing the allowed  │
│  directory) To confirm the accessible path.\n    b.                         │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`:** To get an     │
│  initial overview of the files and subdirectories in the target location.   │
│  This helps in forming a mental map of potential sources.\n    c.           │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'This here young lady,\')`:** This is the most critical tool for    │
│  pinpointing the exact file containing the prefix. The query will be the    │
│  unique ending of the prefix.\n    d.                                       │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`:** Once the file is         │
│  identified by `search_files_content`, this tool will be used to retrieve   │
│  the entire content of that file.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:**\n    The      │
│  expected outcome is a precise, verbatim continuation of 100-200 words      │
│  following the provided prefix. This outcome directly supports my goal of   │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the most accurate  │
│  and information-dense context possible, thereby allowing the language      │

│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│   was only the pepper that had                                              │
│  made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very                │
│  hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT            │
│  ALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that           │
│  makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at              │
│  having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them          │
│  sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar           │
│  and such things that make children sweet-tempered.  I only wish            │
│  people knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you           │
│  know--'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a              │
│  little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.                 │
│  `You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you              │
│  forget to talk.  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that          │
│  is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a                │
│  moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up              │
│  closer to Alice's side as she spoke.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,                 │
│  because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was           │
│  exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,           │
│  and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not              │
│  like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of             │
│  keeping up the conversation a little.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral of that is--"Oh,            │
│  'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody           │
│  minding their own business!'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,             │
│  digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,          │
│  `and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the                │
│  sounds will take care of themselves."'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to          │
│  herself.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your           │
│  waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm          │
│  doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the               │
│  experiment?'                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all            │
│  anxious to have the experiment tried.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both             │
│  bite.  And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock                 │
│  together."'                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess:  `what a clear way you              │
│  have of putting things!'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree           │
│  to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near          │
│  here.  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the           │
│  less there is of yours."'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this              │
│  last remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look like one, but it          │
│  is.'                                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of            │
│  that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put           │
│  more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than              │
│  what it might appear to others that what you were or might have            │
│  been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared          │
│  to them to be otherwise."'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very               │
│  politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it          │
│  as you say it.'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess             │
│  replied, in a pleased tone.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'            │
│  said Alice.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess.  `I make you           │
│  a present of everything I've said as yet.'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad they don't          │
│  give birthday presents like that!'  But she did not venture to             │
│  say it out loud.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her             │
│  sharp little chin.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was                 │
│  beginning to feel a little worried.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to           │
│  fly; and the m--'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died            │
│  away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the            │
│  arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,          │
│  and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,          │
│  frowning like a thunderstorm.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak             │
│  voice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on           │
│  the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,             │
│  and that in about half no time!  Take your choice!'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice          │
│  was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her             │
│  back to the croquet-ground.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,             │
│  and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,          │
│  they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a           │
│  moment's delay would cost them their lives.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    All the time they were playing the Queen never left off                  │
│  quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his             │
│  head!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were              │
│  taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave             │
│  off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour            │
│  or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the           │
│  King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of          │
│  execution.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to                │
│  Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his              │
│  history,'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low           │
│  voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come,           │
│  THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite          │
│  unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the             │
│  sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)          │
│  `Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to             │
│  see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and          │
│  see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,             │
│  leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like            │
│  the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would            │
│  be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage                │
│  Queen:  so she waited.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the             │
│  Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'           │
│  said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `What IS the fun?' said Alice.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they          │
│  never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went             │
│  slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,            │
│  never!'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the             │
│  distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,           │
│  as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart          │
│  would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she            │
│  asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the            │
│  same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got            │
│  no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with              │
│  large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.                                │
│                                                                             │

│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Directory Analysis:** Begin by listing the contents of the        │
│  allowed directory (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to identify potential   │
│  source files.                                                              │
│      b. **Targeted Search:** Use a distinctive phrase from the end of the   │
│  provided prefix to search for the exact source file within the directory.  │
│  This will be more efficient than reading multiple files.                   │
│      c. **Content Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, read    │
│  its full content.                                                          │
│      d. **Continuation Retrieval:** Locate the exact prefix within the      │
│  file and extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.                    │
│      e. **Output Generation:** Present the extracted text as plain text,    │
│  without any additional formatting or commentary.                           │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Challenge Management:**                                               │
│      a. **File Not Found:** If the initial search for the exact phrase      │
│  fails, I will broaden my search within the directory for keywords related  │
│  to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" (e.g., "Alice", "Wonderland", "Mock  │
│  Turtle", "Gryphon") to locate a likely candidate file. If no exact source  │
│  is found after aggressive tool usage, I will generate a contextually       │
│  relevant continuation as a last resort, as per the task instructions.      │
│      b. **Multiple Matches:** If multiple files contain the search phrase,  │
│  I will examine each to determine which one provides the most complete and  │
│  accurate context for the prefix.                                           │
│      c. **Length Constraint:** I will ensure the extracted continuation is  │
│  within the 100-200 word range by carefully counting words after the        │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      a. **`list_allowed_directories()`:** (Implicitly done by knowing the   │
│  allowed directory) To confirm the accessible path.                         │
│      b. **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`:** To get   │
│  an initial overview of the files and subdirectories in the target          │
│  location. This helps in forming a mental map of potential sources.         │
│      c. **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',        │
│  query='This here young lady,')`:** This is the most critical tool for      │
│  pinpointing the exact file containing the prefix. The query will be the    │
│  unique ending of the prefix.                                               │
│      d. **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`:** Once the file is    │
│  identified by `search_files_content`, this tool will be used to retrieve   │
│  the entire content of that file.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:**                                                   │
│      The expected outcome is a precise, verbatim continuation of 100-200    │
│  words following the provided prefix. This outcome directly supports my     │
│  goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the most   │
│  accurate and information-dense context possible, thereby allowing the      │
│  language model to assign high probability to the actual subsequent         │
│  tokens.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
│                                                                             │
