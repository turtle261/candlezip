│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │

│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.' `Are they in   │
│  the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of they jurymen. `No, they're   │
│  not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the queerest thing about it.'     │
│  (The jury all looked puzzled.) `He must have imitated somebody else's      │
│  hand,' said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) `Please your     │
│  Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and they can't prove I did:  │
│  there's no name signed at the end.' `If you didn't sign it,' said the      │
│  King, `that only makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some          │
│  mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.' There   │
│  was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever    │
│  thing the King had said that day. `That PROVES his guilt,' said the        │
│  Queen. `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't even   │
│  know what they're about!' `Read them,' said the King. The White Rabbit     │
│  put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he      │
│  asked. `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on till    │
│  you come to the end: then stop.' These were the verses the White Rabbit    │
│  read:-- `They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She    │
│  gave me a good character, But said I could not swim. He sent them word I   │
│  had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on,    │
│  What would become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us   │
│  three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine    │
│  before. If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He        │
│  trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were. My notion was that     │
│  you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him,  │
│  and ourselves, and it. Don't let him know she liked them best, For this    │
│  must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.'   │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the    │
│  King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--' `If any one of them can   │
│  explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes   │
│  that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him          │
│  sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.' The jury    │
│  all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of    │
│  meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper. `If       │
│  there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a world of trouble,  │
│  you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,' he went    │
│  on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one     │
│  eye; `I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT   │
│  SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave. The      │
│  Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he        │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) `All right, so       │
│  far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself:  │
│  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE,   │
│  THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you     │
│  know--' `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said        │
│  Alice. `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the  │
│  tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then                │
│  again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?'  │
│  he said to the Queen. `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an       │
│  inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had      │
│  left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no      │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling    │
│  down his face, as long as it lasted.) `Then the words don't FIT you,'      │
│  said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead      │
│  silence. `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody   │
│  laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about   │
│  the twentieth time that day. `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence           │
│  first--verdict afterwards.' `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The  │
│  idea of having the sentence first!' `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen,    │
│  turning purple. `I won't!' said Alice. `Off with her head!' the Queen      │
│  shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. `Who cares for you?' said   │
│  Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) `You're nothing but  │
│  a pack of cards!' At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came    │
│  flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half    │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the       │
│  bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing      │
│  away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her      │
│  face. `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep      │
│  you've had!' `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she      │
│  told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange     │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she     │
│  had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream,    │
│  dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice  │
│  got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a      │
│  wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left     │
│  her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking  │
│  of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began       │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of  │
│  little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her  │
│  knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear  │
│  the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head    │
│  to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and   │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her     │
│  became alive the strange creatures of her little sister's dream. The long  │
│  grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened   │
│  Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the   │
│  rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their       │
│  never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her      │
│  unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on    │
│  the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more   │
│  the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil,     │
│  and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up    │
│  with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. So she sat on, with    │
│  closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she  │
│  had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the      │
│  grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the     │
│  waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-  │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and  │
│  the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all thy other       │
│  queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy  │
│  farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the   │
│  place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself     │
│  how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself   │
│  a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the    │
│  simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about   │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many  │
│  a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago:     │
│  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure  │
│  in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy    │
│  summer days. THE END                                                       │

│    `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar                  │
│  angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three          │
│  inches high).                                                              │

│    `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.          │
│  And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so           │
│  easily offended!'                                                          │

│    `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it            │
│  put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.          │
│  In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its              │
│  mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got             │
│  down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely               │
│  remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and             │
│  the other side will make you grow shorter.'                                │

│    `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to            │

│    `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had              │
│  asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a                │
│  minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as          │
│  it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.          │
│  However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they            │
│  would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a             │
│  little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment           │
│  she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her            │
│  foot!                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but           │
│  she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking           │
│  rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.          │
│  Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was           │
│  hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and                 │
│  managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.                           │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│    `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of                  │
│  delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she              │
│  found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could          │
│  see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which            │
│  seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay          │
│  far below her.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.  `And where              │
│  HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I              │
│  can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no            │
│  result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the                 │
│  distant green leaves.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her           │
│  head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted            │
│  to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,            │
│  like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a          │
│  graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which          │
│  she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she          │
│  had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a              │
│  hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating            │
│  her violently with its wings.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more               │
│  subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every              │
│  way, and nothing seems to suit them!'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said               │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've           │
│  tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but          │
│  those serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no            │
│  use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the             │
│  Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and              │
│  day!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was                │
│  beginning to see its meaning.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued          │
│  the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was              │
│  thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come            │
│  wriggling down from the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.  `I'm a--I'm            │
│  a--'                                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can see you're               │
│  trying to invent something!'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she            │
│  remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.            │
│                                                                             │
│    `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the                │
│  deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my               │
│  time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a           │
│  serpent; and there's no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be               │
│  telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very              │
│  truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as                │
│  serpents do, you know.'                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why              │
│  then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent             │
│  for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of              │
│  adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and             │
│  what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a                │
│  serpent?'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm             │
│  not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't             │
│  want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it             │
│  settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the           │
│  trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled            │
│  among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and             │
│  untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the          │
│  pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very                  │
│  carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and                │
│  growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had              │
│  succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,          │
│  that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a           │
│  few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,               │
│  there's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes             │
│  are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to              │
│  another!  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next               │
│  thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be             │
│  done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an              │
│  open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.                │
│  `Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come              │
│  upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their             │
│  wits!'  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did          │
│  not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself              │
│  down to nine inches high.                                                  │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │

│    For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and                  │
│  wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came          │
│  running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman               │
│  because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only,            │
│  she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door           │
│  with his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,            │
│  with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,           │
│  Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their                │
│  heads.  She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and           │
│  crept a little way out of the wood to listen.                              │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: I see a file named `lcet10.txt` in the `cantrbry`        │
│  directory. "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" is sometimes referred to as  │
│  "Alice in Wonderland", and "lcet10" could be an abbreviation for "Lewis    │
│  Carroll's English Text 10" or similar. Given the context of the previous   │
│  chunks, which were clearly from Alice in Wonderland, this file is a very   │
│  strong candidate for containing the source text. I will read the content   │
│  of `lcet10.txt` to confirm.                                                │
