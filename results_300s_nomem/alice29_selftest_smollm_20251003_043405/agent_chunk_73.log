│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │

│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

│  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would               │
│  all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--                    │
│  `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,                         │
│  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'                          │
│  [later editions continued as follows                                       │
│  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,                           │
│  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.                      │
│  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,                         │
│  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:                                  │
│  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,                    │
│  And concluded the banquet--]                                               │
│  `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle             │
│  interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on?  It's by far           │
│  the most confusing thing I ever heard!'                                    │
│  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon:  and              │
│  Alice was only too glad to do so.                                          │
│  `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the                │
│  Gryphon went on.  `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you           │
│  a song?'                                                                   │
│  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'                 │
│  Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather               │
│  offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes!  Sing her "Turtle            │
│  Soup," will you, old fellow?'                                              │
│  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes             │

│    The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when            │
│  they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts           │
│  of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:            │
│  the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on           │
│  each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,            │
│  with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the               │
│  other.  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large          │
│  dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice            │
│  quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'          │
│  she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed          │
│  to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about          │
│  her, to pass away the time.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had           │
│  read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that           │
│  she knew the name of nearly everything there.  `That's the                 │
│  judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown            │
│  over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he          │
│  did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly          │
│  not becoming.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve              │
│  creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because          │
│  some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they           │
│  are the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three times over          │
│  to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and                │
│  rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the                │
│  meaning of it at all.  However, `jury-men' would have done just            │
│  as well.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.                │
│  `What are they doing?'  Alice whispered to the Gryphon.  `They             │
│  can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in             │
│  reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the             │
│  trial.'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but             │
│  she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in           │
│  the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked                  │
│  anxiously round, to make out who was talking.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their               │
│  shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'          │
│  on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them              │
│  didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his              │
│  neighbour to tell him.  `A nice muddle their slates'll be in               │
│  before the trial's over!' thought Alice.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.  This of course,           │
│  Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got                │
│  behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it                │
│  away.  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was            │
│  Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of             │
│  it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write            │
│  with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very              │
│  little use, as it left no mark on the slate.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.                            │
│                                                                             │
│    On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and           │
│  then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--                 │
│                                                                             │

│        The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,                           │

│    `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit            │

│    The first witness was the Hatter.  He came in with a teacup in           │
│  one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.  `I beg             │
│  pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I            │
│  hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to have finished,' said the King.  `When did you              │
│  begin?'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into           │
│  the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.  `Fourteenth of March, I          │
│  think it was,' he said.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury               │
│  eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then               │
│  added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who                   │
│  instantly made a memorandum of the fact.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;               │
│  `I've none of my own.  I'm a hatter.'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the           │
│  Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or           │
│  I'll have you executed on the spot.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept              │
│  shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the               │
│  Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his                │
│  teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which           │
│  puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she was           │
│  beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she               │
│  would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she               │
│  decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for              │
│  her.                                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was             │
│  sitting next to her.  `I can hardly breathe.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly:  `you know                │
│  you're growing too.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:               │
│  `not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily              │
│  and crossed over to the other side of the court.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the                │
│  Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to           │
│  one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the                │
│  singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter                 │
│  trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have           │
│  you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'                              │

│    `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a                   │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
│                                                                             │

│    Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately                 │
│  suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a             │
│  hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had           │
│  a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:               │
│  into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat            │
│  upon it.)                                                                  │

│    `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often           │
│  read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some              │
│  attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the              │
│  officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant               │
│  till now.'                                                                 │

│    `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'                   │

│    Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.  `Now we           │
│  shall get on better.'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious             │
│  look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the           │
│  court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one           │
│  of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the               │
│  officer could get to the door.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Call the next witness!' said the King.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the                │
│  pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before          │
│  she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began          │
│  sneezing all at once.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' said the King.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Shan't,' said the cook.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a             │
│  low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy              │
│  air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till             │
│  his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What          │
│  are tarts made of?'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that            │
│  Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch          │
│  him!  Off with his whiskers!'                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the           │
│  Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down                │
│  again, the cook had disappeared.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.                │
│  `Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the              │
│  Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.          │
│  It quite makes my forehead ache!'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,              │
│  feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,           │
│  `--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.           │
│  Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top           │
│  of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'                              │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                             CHAPTER XII                                     │
│                                                                             │
│                          Alice's Evidence                                   │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the               │
│  moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she            │
│  jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with           │
│  the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads           │
│  of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding          │
│  her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset            │
│  the week before.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great                │
│  dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,           │
│  for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and             │
│  she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once           │
│  and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave                │
│  voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--            │
│  ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as            │
│  he said do.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she            │
│  had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing            │
│  was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable          │
│  to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that           │
│  it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it                │
│  would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'          │
│                                                                             │
│    As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of             │
│  being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and               │
│  handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write             │
│  out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed           │
│  too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,              │
│  gazing up into the roof of the court.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `What do you know about this business?' the King said to                 │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing,' said Alice.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.             │
│  They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when          │
│  the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,           │
│  of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and            │
│  making faces at him as he spoke.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and            │
│  went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--              │
│  unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word                  │
│  sounded best.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some                     │
│  `unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to            │
│  look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she                 │
│  thought to herself.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily               │
│  writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out              │
│  from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE              │
│  HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Everybody looked at Alice.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `You are,' said the King.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides,                 │
│  that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.                            │
│                                                                             │
│    The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.                    │
│  `Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling          │
│  voice.                                                                     │

│    `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said           │
│  the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has             │
│  just been picked up.'                                                      │

│    `What's in it?' said the Queen.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems          │
│  to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was                  │
│  written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,             │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of               │
│  they jurymen.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the                │
│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.             │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and           │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the             │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the               │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't            │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Read them,' said the King.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,           │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on              │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                           │
│                                                                             │
│          `They told me you had been to her,                                 │
│            And mentioned me to him:                                         │
│          She gave me a good character,                                      │
│            But said I could not swim.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│          He sent them word I had not gone                                   │
│            (We know it to be true):                                         │
│          If she should push the matter on,                                  │
│            What would become of you?                                        │
│                                                                             │
│          I gave her one, they gave him two,                                 │
│            You gave us three or more;                                       │
│          They all returned from him to you,                                 │
│            Though they were mine before.                                    │
│                                                                             │

│          He trusts to you to set them free,                                 │
│            Exactly as we were.                                              │

│    `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'           │

│                                                                             │
│    `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe            │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a              │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.           │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│                                                                             │
│    `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering             │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said              │
│  Alice.                                                                     │

│    `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to           │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the           │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round             │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                    │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having            │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    `I won't!' said Alice.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.          │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full              │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying             │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told            │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│                                                                             │
│    But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her               │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│                                                                             │
│    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the           │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried           │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in            │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of           │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│                                                                             │
│                               THE END                                       │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │

│    `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,             │
│  looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the           │
│  Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-              │
│  and-butter--'                                                              │

│    `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you                │
│  executed.'                                                                 │

│    The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,            │
│  and went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he             │
│  began.                                                                     │

│    `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately                 │
│  suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a             │
│  hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had           │
│  a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:               │
│  into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat            │
│  upon it.)                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often           │
│  read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some              │
│  attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the              │
│  officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant               │
│  till now.'                                                                 │

│    `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'                   │
│  continued the King.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as           │
│  it is.'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.  `Now we           │
│  shall get on better.'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious             │
│  look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the           │
│  court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one           │
│  of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the               │
│  officer could get to the door.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Call the next witness!' said the King.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the                │
│  pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before          │
│  she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began          │
│  sneezing all at once.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' said the King.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Shan't,' said the cook.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a             │
│  low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy              │
│  air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till             │
│  his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What          │
│  are tarts made of?'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that            │
│  Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch          │
│  him!  Off with his whiskers!'                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the           │
│  Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down                │
│  again, the cook had disappeared.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.                │
│  `Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the              │
│  Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.          │
│  It quite makes my forehead ache!'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,              │
│  feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,           │
│  `--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.           │
│  Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top           │
│  of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'                              │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                             CHAPTER XII                                     │
│                                                                             │
│                          Alice's Evidence                                   │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the               │
│  moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she            │
│  jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with           │
│  the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads           │
│  of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding          │
│  her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset            │
│  the week before.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great                │
│  dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,           │
│  for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and             │
│  she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once           │
│  and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave                │
│  voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--            │
│  ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as            │
│  he said do.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she            │
│  had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing            │
│  was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable          │
│  to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that           │
│  it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it                │
│  would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'          │
│                                                                             │
│    As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of             │
│  being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and               │
│  handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write             │
│  out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed           │
│  too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,              │
│  gazing up into the roof of the court.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `What do you know about this business?' the King said to                 │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing,' said Alice.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.             │
│  They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when          │
│  the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,           │
│  of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and            │
│  making faces at him as he spoke.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and            │
│  went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--              │
│  unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word                  │
│  sounded best.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some                     │
│  `unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to            │
│  look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she                 │
│  thought to herself.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily               │
│  writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out              │
│  from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE              │
│  HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Everybody looked at Alice.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `You are,' said the King.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides,                 │
│  that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.                            │
│                                                                             │
│    The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.                    │
│  `Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling          │
│  voice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said           │
│  the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has             │
│  just been picked up.'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `What's in it?' said the Queen.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems          │
│  to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was                  │
│  written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,             │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │

│    `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of               │

│                                                                             │
│    `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the                │
│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.             │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and           │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the             │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the               │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't            │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Read them,' said the King.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,           │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on              │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                           │
│                                                                             │
│          `They told me you had been to her,                                 │
│            And mentioned me to him:                                         │
│          She gave me a good character,                                      │
│            But said I could not swim.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│          He sent them word I had not gone                                   │
│            (We know it to be true):                                         │
│          If she should push the matter on,                                  │
│            What would become of you?                                        │
│                                                                             │
│          I gave her one, they gave him two,                                 │
│            You gave us three or more;                                       │
│          They all returned from him to you,                                 │
│            Though they were mine before.                                    │
│                                                                             │

│          He trusts to you to set them free,                                 │
│            Exactly as we were.                                              │
│                                                                             │

│            An obstacle that came between                                    │
│            Him, and ourselves, and it.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│          Don't let him know she liked them best,                            │
│            For this must ever be                                            │
│          A secret, kept from all the rest,                                  │
│            Between yourself and me.'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'           │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe            │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a              │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.           │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│                                                                             │
│    `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering             │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said              │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to           │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the           │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round             │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                    │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having            │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I won't!' said Alice.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.          │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full              │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying             │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told            │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│                                                                             │
│    But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her               │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│                                                                             │
│    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the           │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │

AGENT_RESULT_JSON:{"final_text": "trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week\nor so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and\nthe twinkling of the tea--'\n\n  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.\n\n  `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\n\n  `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.\n`Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on!'\n\n  `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things\ntwinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'\n\n  `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\n  `You did!' said the Hatter.\n\n  `I deny it!' said the March Hare.\n\n  `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.'\n\n  `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,\nlooking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the\nDormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.\n\n  `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-\nand-butter--'\n\n  `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\n\n  `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\n\n  `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you\nexecuted.'\n\n  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,\nand went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he\nbegan.\n\n  `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\n\n  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately\nsuppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a\nhard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had\na large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:\ninto this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat\nupon it.)\n\n  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often\nread in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some\nattempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the\nofficers of the court,\" and I never understood what it meant\ntill now.'\n\n  `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'\ncontinued the King.\n\n  `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as\nit is.'\n\n  `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.\n\n  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\n  `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.  `Now we\nshall get on better.'\n\n  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious\nlook at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n\n  `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the\ncourt, without even waiting to put his shoes on.\n\n  `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one\nof the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the\nofficer could get to the door.\n\n  `Call the next witness!' said the King.\n\n  The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the\npepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before\nshe got into the court, by the way the people near the door began\nsneezing all at once.\n\n  `Give your evidence,' said the King.\n\n  `Shan't,' said the cook.\n\n  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a\nlow voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'\n\n  `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy\nair, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till\nhis eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What\nare tarts made of?'\n\n  `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.\n\n  `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.\n\n  `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that\nDormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch\nhim!  Off with his whiskers!'\n\n  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the\nDormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down\nagain, the cook had disappeared.\n\n  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.\n`Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the\nQueen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.\nIt quite makes my forehead ache!'\n\n  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,\nfeeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,\n`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.\nImagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top\nof his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'\n\n\n\n                           CHAPTER XII\n\n                        Alice's Evidence\n\n\n  `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the\nmoment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she\njumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with\nthe edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads\nof the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding\nher very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset\nthe week before.\n\n  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great\ndismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,\nfor the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and\nshe had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once\nand put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\n\n  `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave\nvoice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--\nALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as\nhe said do.\n\n  Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she\nhad put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing\nwas waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable\nto move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that\nit signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it\nwould be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'\n\n  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of\nbeing upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and\nhanded back to them, they set to work very diligently to write\nout a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed\ntoo much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,\ngazing up into the roof of the court.\n\n  `What do you know about this business?' the King said to\nAlice.\n\n  `Nothing,' said Alice.\n\n  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.\n\n  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.\n\n  `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.\nThey were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when\nthe White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,\nof course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and\nmaking faces at him as he spoke.\n\n  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and\nwent on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--\nunimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word\nsounded best.\n\n  Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some\n`unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to\nlook over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she\nthought to herself.\n\n  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily\nwriting in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out\nfrom his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE\nHIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'\n\n  Everybody looked at Alice.\n\n  `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.\n\n  `You are,' said the King.\n\n  `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.\n\n  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides,\nthat's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'\n\n  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.\n\n  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.\n\n  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.\n`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling\nvoice.\n\n  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said\nthe White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has\njust been picked up.'\n\n  `What's in it?' said the Queen.\n\n  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems\nto be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'\n\n  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was\nwritten to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'\n\n  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.\n\n  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,\nthere's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper\nas he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set\nof verses.'\n\n  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of\nthey jurymen.\n\n  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the\nqueerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n\n  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.\n(The jury all brightened up again.)\n\n  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and\nthey can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'\n\n  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the\nmatter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd\nhave signed your name like an honest man.'\n\n  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the\nfirst really clever thing the King had said that day.\n\n  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.\n\n  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't\neven know what they're about!'\n\n  `Read them,' said the King.\n\n  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,\nplease your Majesty?' he asked.\n\n  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on\ntill you come to the end:  then stop.'\n\n  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--\n\n        `They told me you had been to her,\n          And mentioned me to him:\n        She gave me a good character,\n          But said I could not swim.\n\n        He sent them word I had not gone\n          (We know it to be true):\n        If she should push the matter on,\n          What would become of you?\n\n        I gave her one, they gave him two,\n          You gave us three or more;\n        They all returned from him to you,\n          Though they were mine before.\n\n        If I or she should chance to be\n          Involved in this affair,\n        He trusts to you to set them free,\n          Exactly as we were.\n\n        My notion was that you had been\n          (Before she had this fit)\n          An obstacle that came between\n          Him, and ourselves, and it.\n\n        Don't let him know she liked them best,\n          For this must ever be\n        A secret, kept from all the rest,\n          Between yourself and me.'\n\n  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'\nsaid the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'\n\n  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had\ngrown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit\nafraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't\nbelieve there's an atom of meaning in it.'\n\n  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe\nthere's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to\nexplain the paper.\n\n  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a\nworld of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And\nyet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his\nknee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some\nmeaning in them, after all.  \"--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--\" you\ncan't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.\n\n  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.\n(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n\n  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering\nover the verses to himself:  `\"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\" that's\nthe jury, of course-- \"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\" why,\nthat must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'\n\n  `But, it goes on \"THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\"' said\nAlice.\n\n  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to\nthe tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.\nThen again--\"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--\"  you never had fits, my\ndear, I think?' he said to the Queen.\n\n  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the\nLizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off\nwriting on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no\nmark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was\ntrickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)\n\n  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round\nthe court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.\n\n  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and\neverybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the\nKing said, for about the twentieth time that day.\n\n  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'\n\n  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having\nthe sentence first!'\n\n  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.\n\n  `I won't!' said Alice.\n\n  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.\nNobody moved.\n\n  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full\nsize by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'\n\n  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying\ndown upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half\nof anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on\nthe bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently\nbrushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the\ntrees upon her face.\n\n  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long\nsleep you've had!'\n\n  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told\nher sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and\nwhen she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a\ncurious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's\ngetting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she\nran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.\n\n  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her\nhead on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of\nlittle Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began\ndreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--\n\n  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the\ntiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes\nwere looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her\nvoice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back\nthe wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and\nstill as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place\naround her became alive the strange creatures of her little\nsister's dream.\n\n  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried\nby--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the\nneighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as\nthe March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,\nand the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate\nguests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the\nDuchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once\nmore the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's\nslate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable\nMock Turtle.\n\n  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and\nall would change to dull reality--the grass would be only\nrustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the\nreeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-\nbells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd\nboy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and\nall thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the\nconfused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the\ncattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\nheavy sobs.\n\n  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of\nhers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how\nshe would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and\nloving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about\nher other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager\nwith many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of\nWonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their\nsimple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\nremembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\n\n                             THE END", "duration_ms": 121409}
trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week
or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and
the twinkling of the tea--'

  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.

  `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.

  `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.
`Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on!'

  `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things
twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'

  `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

  `You did!' said the Hatter.

  `I deny it!' said the March Hare.

  `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.'

  `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,
looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the
Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.

  `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-
and-butter--'

  `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.

  `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.

  `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you
executed.'

  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,
and went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he
began.

  `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.

  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately
suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a
hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had
a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:
into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat
upon it.)

  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often
read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some
attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the
officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant
till now.'

  `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'
continued the King.

  `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as
it is.'

  `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.

  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

  `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.  `Now we
shall get on better.'

  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious
look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

  `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the
court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.

  `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one
of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the
officer could get to the door.

  `Call the next witness!' said the King.

  The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the
pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before
she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began
sneezing all at once.

  `Give your evidence,' said the King.

  `Shan't,' said the cook.

  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a
low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'

  `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy
air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What
are tarts made of?'

  `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.

  `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.

  `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that
Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch
him!  Off with his whiskers!'

  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the
Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down
again, the cook had disappeared.

  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.
`Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the
Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
It quite makes my forehead ache!'

  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,
`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.
Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top
of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'



                           CHAPTER XII

                        Alice's Evidence


  `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with
the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
the week before.

  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.

  `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave
voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--
ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as
he said do.

  Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she
had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that
it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'

  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write
out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,
gazing up into the roof of the court.

  `What do you know about this business?' the King said to
Alice.

  `Nothing,' said Alice.

  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.

  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.

  `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when
the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,
of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and
making faces at him as he spoke.

  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and
went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--
unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word
sounded best.

  Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some
`unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to
look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she
thought to herself.

  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily
writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out
from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'

  Everybody looked at Alice.

  `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.

  `You are,' said the King.

  `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.

  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides,
that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'

  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.

  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.

  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.
`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling
voice.

  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has
just been picked up.'

  `What's in it?' said the Queen.

  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems
to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'

  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was
written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'

  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.

  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,
there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper
as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set
of verses.'

  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of
they jurymen.

  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the
queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)

  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.
(The jury all brightened up again.)

  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and
they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'

  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the
matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd
have signed your name like an honest man.'

  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day.

  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.

  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't
even know what they're about!'

  `Read them,' said the King.

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?' he asked.

  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on
till you come to the end:  then stop.'

  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--

        `They told me you had been to her,
          And mentioned me to him:
        She gave me a good character,
          But said I could not swim.

        He sent them word I had not gone
          (We know it to be true):
        If she should push the matter on,
          What would become of you?

        I gave her one, they gave him two,
          You gave us three or more;
        They all returned from him to you,
          Though they were mine before.

        If I or she should chance to be
          Involved in this affair,
        He trusts to you to set them free,
          Exactly as we were.

        My notion was that you had been
          (Before she had this fit)
          An obstacle that came between
          Him, and ourselves, and it.

        Don't let him know she liked them best,
          For this must ever be
        A secret, kept from all the rest,
          Between yourself and me.'

  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'
said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'

  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit
afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't
believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'

  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe
there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to
explain the paper.

  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a
world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And
yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his
knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some
meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you
can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.

  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.
(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)

  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's
the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,
that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'

  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said
Alice.

  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to
the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my
dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.

  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)

  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round
the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.

  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and
everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the
King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'

  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having
the sentence first!'

  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.

  `I won't!' said Alice.

  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
Nobody moved.

  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full
size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'

  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face.

  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long
sleep you've had!'

  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and
when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a
curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's
getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--

  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sister's dream.

  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's
slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle.

  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-
bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
heavy sobs.

  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about
her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
