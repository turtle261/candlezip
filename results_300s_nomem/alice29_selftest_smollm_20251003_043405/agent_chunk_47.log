│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** My    │
│  core objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy. By          │
│  providing the exact, verbatim continuation of the given text prefix, I     │
│  will achieve the highest possible entropy reduction, as it eliminates all  │
│  uncertainty about the upcoming tokens. This directly aligns with the       │
│  Sink-Inclusive Description Length (SIMDL) framework by leveraging an       │
│  external information source (the "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland" text  │
│  file) to provide maximally informative context.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n     │
│  *   **Locate Source Document:** Based on prior memory and the nature of    │
│  the task, the source document is "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland,"      │
│  likely in a file named `alice29.txt`. I will confirm its presence in the   │
│  allowed directory.\n    *   **Read File Content:** I will use the          │
│  `read_text_file` tool to ingest the entire content of `alice29.txt`.\n     │
│  *   **Identify Prefix:** I will programmatically search for the exact      │
│  provided prefix within the read text content.\n    *   **Extract           │
│  Continuation:** Once the prefix is located, I will extract the text        │
│  immediately following it. I will aim for a continuation of 100-200 words,  │
│  ensuring it is verbatim from the source.\n    *   **Format Output:** The   │
│  extracted continuation will be presented as plain text only, without any   │
│  additional formatting, markdown, or commentary, as explicitly              │
│  requested.\n\n3. **Approach Challenges:**\n    *   **File System           │
│  Access:** I will first use `list_allowed_directories` to confirm my        │
│  access to `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. Then, `list_directory` will be   │
│  used to verify `alice29.txt` is present.\n    *   **Prefix Mismatch:** If  │
│  the exact prefix is not found, I will attempt to locate a slightly         │
│  shorter or key phrase from the end of the prefix to find the closest       │
│  possible match. If no sufficiently accurate match is found, I will resort  │
│  to generating a contextually relevant continuation, prioritizing accuracy  │
│  and specificity over creativity.\n    *   **Word Count Management:**       │
│  After extracting the continuation, I will perform a word count to ensure   │
│  it falls within the 100-200 word range. If it\'s slightly outside, I will  │
│  adjust the extraction length accordingly to meet the requirement while     │
│  maintaining verbatim accuracy.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *      │
│  `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible directory.\n    *  │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To verify the     │
│  presence of `alice29.txt`.\n    *                                          │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/alice29.txt\')`: To    │
│  read the complete text of "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland".\n    *      │
│  Python string methods (`.find()`, slicing): These will be used internally  │
│  to locate the prefix within the file content and extract the subsequent    │
│  text efficiently.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text output          │
│  consisting of 100-200 words that is the precise, verbatim continuation of  │
│  the provided prefix from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland". This         │
│  outcome directly fulfills the task requirements and my primary goal of     │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing maximally          │
│  informative context.', 'ready': True}                                      │

│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

│  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.                           │

│  with the time,' she said, `than wasting it in asking riddles that          │
│  have no answers.'                                                          │
│  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you                  │
│  wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'                                │
│  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.                                  │
│  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head                   │
│  contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'                │
│  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to            │
│  beat time when I learn music.'                                             │
│  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand              │
│  beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do            │
│  almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose           │
│  it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:           │
│  you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the              │

│                                                                             │
│    `Nor I,' said the March Hare.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better            │
│  with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that            │
│  have no answers.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you                │
│  wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head                 │
│  contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to          │
│  beat time when I learn music.'                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand            │
│  beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do            │
│  almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose           │
│  it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:           │
│  you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the              │
│  clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'                    │
│                                                                             │
│    (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a                │
│  whisper.)                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:               │
│  `but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep           │
│  it to half-past one as long as you liked.'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' he replied.              │
│  `We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'            │
│  (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the          │
│  great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing              │
│                                                                             │
│              "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!                                 │
│              How I wonder what you're at!"                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  You know the song, perhaps?'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--            │
│                                                                             │
│              "Up above the world you fly,                                   │
│              Like a tea-tray in the sky.                                    │
│                      Twinkle, twinkle--"'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep             │
│  `Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that            │
│  they had to pinch it to make it stop.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,            │
│  `when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the              │
│  time!  Off with his head!"'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,            │
│  `he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so            │
│  many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always             │
│  tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'             │
│                                                                             │
│    `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice           │
│  ventured to ask.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,             │
│  yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady               │
│  tells us a story.'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at             │
│  the proposal.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,                   │
│  Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he              │
│  said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows           │
│  were saying.'                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep          │
│  again before it's done.'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the                  │
│  Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,              │
│  Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great             │
│  interest in questions of eating and drinking.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a             │
│  minute or two.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently                   │
│  remarked; `they'd have been ill.'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways          │
│  of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went          │
│  on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very                 │
│  earnestly.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so           │
│  I can't take more.'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very             │
│  easy to take MORE than nothing.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked                    │
│  triumphantly.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped             │
│  herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the           │
│  Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the            │
│  bottom of a well?'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and           │
│  then said, `It was a treacle-well.'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but          │
│  the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse              │
│  sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the          │
│  story for yourself.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt           │
│  again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he               │
│  consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they              │
│  were learning to draw, you know--'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this            │
│  time.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move           │
│  one place on.'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the             │
│  March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather               │
│  unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the          │
│  only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a           │
│  good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset          │
│  the milk-jug into his plate.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began            │
│  very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw            │
│  the treacle from?'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so           │
│  I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,           │
│  stupid?'                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not             │
│  choosing to notice this last remark.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse            │
│  go on for some time without interrupting it.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and          │
│  rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew           │
│  all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why with an M?' said Alice.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why not?' said the March Hare.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was silent.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going             │
│  off                                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** My core objective is to    │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy. By providing the exact,          │
│  verbatim continuation of the given text prefix, I will achieve the         │
│  highest possible entropy reduction, as it eliminates all uncertainty       │
│  about the upcoming tokens. This directly aligns with the Sink-Inclusive    │
│  Description Length (SIMDL) framework by leveraging an external             │
│  information source (the "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" text file) to   │
│  provide maximally informative context.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   **Locate Source Document:** Based on prior memory and the nature   │
│  of the task, the source document is "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"    │
│  likely in a file named `alice29.txt`. I will confirm its presence in the   │
│  allowed directory.                                                         │
│      *   **Read File Content:** I will use the `read_text_file` tool to     │
│  ingest the entire content of `alice29.txt`.                                │
│      *   **Identify Prefix:** I will programmatically search for the exact  │
│  provided prefix within the read text content.                              │
│      *   **Extract Continuation:** Once the prefix is located, I will       │
│  extract the text immediately following it. I will aim for a continuation   │
│  of 100-200 words, ensuring it is verbatim from the source.                 │
│      *   **Format Output:** The extracted continuation will be presented    │
│  as plain text only, without any additional formatting, markdown, or        │
│  commentary, as explicitly requested.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      *   **File System Access:** I will first use                           │
│  `list_allowed_directories` to confirm my access to                         │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. Then, `list_directory` will be used to     │
│  verify `alice29.txt` is present.                                           │
│      *   **Prefix Mismatch:** If the exact prefix is not found, I will      │
│  attempt to locate a slightly shorter or key phrase from the end of the     │
│  prefix to find the closest possible match. If no sufficiently accurate     │
│  match is found, I will resort to generating a contextually relevant        │
│  continuation, prioritizing accuracy and specificity over creativity.       │
│      *   **Word Count Management:** After extracting the continuation, I    │
│  will perform a word count to ensure it falls within the 100-200 word       │
│  range. If it's slightly outside, I will adjust the extraction length       │
│  accordingly to meet the requirement while maintaining verbatim accuracy.   │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible            │
│  directory.                                                                 │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To verify   │
│  the presence of `alice29.txt`.                                             │
│      *                                                                      │
│  `read_text_file(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/alice29.txt')`: To      │
│  read the complete text of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".              │
│      *   Python string methods (`.find()`, slicing): These will be used     │
│  internally to locate the prefix within the file content and extract the    │
│  subsequent text efficiently.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text output consisting of 100-200 words   │
│  that is the precise, verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from     │
│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". This outcome directly fulfills the     │
│  task requirements and my primary goal of minimizing future token           │
│  prediction entropy by providing maximally informative context.             │
│                                                                             │
