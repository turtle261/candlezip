│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The   │
│  primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing   │
│  the exact, immediate continuation of the given text prefix. This directly  │
│  translates to finding the source document and extracting the verbatim      │
│  text that follows the prefix, thereby providing maximally informative      │
│  context and reducing the language model\'s uncertainty. The use of tools   │
│  is a measured cost, so efficiency is key.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    *      │
│  **Identify Source Material:** The provided prefix is clearly from          │
│  "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.\n    *   **Locate    │
│  Source Document:** I will search the designated entropy sink directory     │
│  (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) for a file containing this text.\n    *   │
│  **Extract Verbatim Continuation:** Once the source file is identified, I   │
│  will locate the exact end of the provided prefix within the file and       │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    *   **Format Output:** The      │
│  final output must be plain text only, without any additional formatting,   │
│  analysis, or commentary.\n\n3. **Approach Challenges:**\n    *   **File    │
│  Not Found:** If `search_files_content` does not yield a result, I will     │
│  broaden my search terms or try listing the directory contents to manually  │
│  inspect potential files. However, given the task constraints and the       │
│  "sink" directory, it is highly probable the file exists.\n    *            │
│  **Ambiguous Matches:** If multiple files contain the prefix, I will        │
│  prioritize the most complete or contextually relevant match, potentially   │
│  by examining file names or surrounding text if necessary.\n    *           │
│  **Ensuring Verbatim Extraction:** I will use precise string matching and   │
│  slicing to guarantee the continuation is word-for-word from the            │
│  source.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                             │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: I will first  │
│  use this to get an overview of the files present in the allowed            │
│  directory. This helps in understanding the potential candidates for the    │
│  source document.\n    *                                                    │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'He  │
│  first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that      │
│  case I can go\')`**: This is the most critical tool. I will use a unique   │
│  and sufficiently long segment from the *end* of the provided prefix as     │
│  the `query` to accurately locate the specific file containing the text.    │
│  This ensures I find the exact point of continuation.\n    *                │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`**: Once                     │
│  `search_files_content` returns the file path, I will use `read_text_file`  │
│  to retrieve the entire content of that document.\n    *   **Python String  │
│  Operations:** After reading the file, I will use Python\'s built-in        │
│  string methods (`.find()`, slicing) to precisely locate the end of the     │
│  prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words. I will count words to     │
│  ensure the length requirement is met.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain  │
│  text string of 100-200 words, representing the exact continuation of the   │
│  provided prefix from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland." This outcome     │
│  directly fulfills the task requirement and my objective of minimizing      │

│  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a            │
│  moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her            │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:                │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the                 │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found                 │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.               │
│  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back  │
│  to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any      │
│  rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time     │
│  she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,'   │
│  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the  │
│  words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.               │
│  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not  │
│  going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see     │
│  whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice        │
│  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild    │
│  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember    │
│  the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot    │
│  poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your      │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never      │
│  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is     │
│  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:5                                                                  │
│  . First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to  │
│  shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might    │
│  end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like   │
│  a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy     │
│  what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for   │
│  she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while,       │
│  finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden   │
│  at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found     │
│  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the     │
│  table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it  │
│  quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one    │
│  of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired  │
│  herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.         │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:6                                                                  │
│  under the door; or if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key on the  │
│  table. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.            │
│  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that    │
│  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm       │
│  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'     │
│  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of     │
│  sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder   │
│  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_  │
│  shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself      │
│  about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to    │
│  them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!    │
│  Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'           │
│                                                                             │

│  and if I was the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the       │
│  same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great    │
│  puzzle! And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were    │
│  of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any  │
│  of them. 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such      │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I      │
│  can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows     │
│  such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how       │
│  puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let  │
│  me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and     │
│  four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!    │
│  However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.    │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and      │
│  Rome--no, that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for      │
│  Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little busy bee." And she crossed    │
│  her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat    │
│  it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come   │
│  the same as they used to do:--                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many         │
│  lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it: if I'm Mabel, I'll    │
│  stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying  │
│  "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell   │
│  me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if     │
│  not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried     │
│  Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their       │
│  heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!'                   │
│  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see    │
│  that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she  │
│  was talking. `How CAN I have done that?' she thought. `I must be growing   │
│  large again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it,   │
│  and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet   │
│  high, and was rapidly shrinking: she soon found out that the cause of      │
│  this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in      │
│  time to avoid being shrunk to nothing.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│   this curious                                                              │
│  child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no          │
│  use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,          │
│  there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable                   │
│  person!'                                                                   │

│    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under             │
│  the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on           │
│  which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.              │
│  `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,          │
│  I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep          │
│  under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I              │
│  don't care which happens!'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which              │
│  way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to              │
│  feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to              │
│  find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally          │
│  happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the             │
│  way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,              │
│  that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the              │
│  common way.                                                                │

│    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.                 │

│  It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a              │
│  pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the                │
│  other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to              │
│  himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she           │
│  be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate              │
│  that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit             │
│  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,           │
│  sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid                │
│  gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard            │
│  as he could go.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very              │
│  hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:            │
│  `Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday               │
│  things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in            │
│  the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this               │
│  morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little                   │
│  different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in          │
│  the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began              │
│  thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age          │
│  as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of               │
│  them.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such             │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm             │
│  sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,            │
│  oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,          │
│  and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the          │
│  things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,            │
│  and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!          │
│  I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the                    │
│  Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.                │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,          │
│  and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been             │
│  changed for Mabel!  I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'              │
│  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,        │
│  and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and                   │
│  strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--         │
│                                                                             │
│              `How doth the little crocodile                                 │
│                Improve his shining tail,                                    │
│              And pour the waters of the Nile                                │
│                On every golden scale!                                       │
│                                                                             │
│              `How cheerfully he seems to grin,                              │
│                How neatly spread his claws,                                 │
│              And welcome little fishes in                                   │
│                With gently smiling jaws!'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and           │
│  her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel          │
│  after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little             │
│  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so              │
│  many lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm          │
│  Mabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their           │
│  heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"  I shall only look            │
│  up and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I             │
│  like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down              │
│  here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a           │
│  sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads               │
│  down!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was                   │
│  surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little            │
│  white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done              │
│  that?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up          │
│  and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,            │
│  as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,             │
│  and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the           │
│  cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it              │
│  hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  `That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at          │
│  the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in                  │
│  existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed            │
│  back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut              │
│  again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as           │
│  before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,          │
│  `for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare            │
│  it's too bad, that it is!'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another                 │
│  moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He first            │
│  idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that            │
│  case I can go                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The primary goal is to     │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact,           │
│  immediate continuation of the given text prefix. This directly translates  │
│  to finding the source document and extracting the verbatim text that       │
│  follows the prefix, thereby providing maximally informative context and    │
│  reducing the language model's uncertainty. The use of tools is a measured  │
│  cost, so efficiency is key.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   **Identify Source Material:** The provided prefix is clearly from  │
│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.                       │
│      *   **Locate Source Document:** I will search the designated entropy   │
│  sink directory (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) for a file containing      │
│  this text.                                                                 │
│      *   **Extract Verbatim Continuation:** Once the source file is         │
│  identified, I will locate the exact end of the provided prefix within the  │
│  file and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                             │
│      *   **Format Output:** The final output must be plain text only,       │
│  without any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.                │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      *   **File Not Found:** If `search_files_content` does not yield a     │
│  result, I will broaden my search terms or try listing the directory        │
│  contents to manually inspect potential files. However, given the task      │
│  constraints and the "sink" directory, it is highly probable the file       │
│  exists.                                                                    │
│      *   **Ambiguous Matches:** If multiple files contain the prefix, I     │
│  will prioritize the most complete or contextually relevant match,          │
│  potentially by examining file names or surrounding text if necessary.      │
│      *   **Ensuring Verbatim Extraction:** I will use precise string        │
│  matching and slicing to guarantee the continuation is word-for-word from   │
│  the source.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: I will  │
│  first use this to get an overview of the files present in the allowed      │
│  directory. This helps in understanding the potential candidates for the    │
│  source document.                                                           │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='He first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and    │
│  in that case I can go')`**: This is the most critical tool. I will use a   │
│  unique and sufficiently long segment from the *end* of the provided        │
│  prefix as the `query` to accurately locate the specific file containing    │
│  the text. This ensures I find the exact point of continuation.             │
│      *   **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`**: Once               │
│  `search_files_content` returns the file path, I will use `read_text_file`  │
│  to retrieve the entire content of that document.                           │
│      *   **Python String Operations:** After reading the file, I will use   │
│  Python's built-in string methods (`.find()`, slicing) to precisely locate  │
│  the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words. I will     │
│  count words to ensure the length requirement is met.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string of 100-200 words,             │
│  representing the exact continuation of the provided prefix from "Alice's   │
│  Adventures in Wonderland." This outcome directly fulfills the task         │
│  requirement and my objective of minimizing prediction entropy by           │
│  providing the ground truth.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
