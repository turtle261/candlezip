│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │

│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

│  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'                   │
│  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.                           │
│  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.                                              │
│  Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better              │
│  with the time,' she said, `than wasting it in asking riddles that          │
│  have no answers.'                                                          │
│  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you                  │
│  wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'                                │
│  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.                                  │
│  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head                   │
│  contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'                │
│  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to            │
│  beat time when I learn music.'                                             │
│  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand              │
│  beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do            │
│  almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose           │
│  it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:           │
│  you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the              │
│  clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'                    │
│                                                                             │

│    `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so           │
│  I can't take more.'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very             │
│  easy to take MORE than nothing.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked                    │
│  triumphantly.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped             │
│  herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the           │
│  Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the            │
│  bottom of a well?'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and           │
│  then said, `It was a treacle-well.'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but          │
│  the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse              │
│  sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the          │
│  story for yourself.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt           │
│  again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he               │
│  consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they              │
│  were learning to draw, you know--'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this            │
│  time.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move           │
│  one place on.'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the             │
│  March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather               │
│  unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the          │
│  only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a           │
│  good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset          │
│  the milk-jug into his plate.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began            │
│  very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw            │
│  the treacle from?'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so           │
│  I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,           │
│  stupid?'                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not             │
│  choosing to notice this last remark.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse            │
│  go on for some time without interrupting it.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and          │
│  rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew           │
│  all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why with an M?' said Alice.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why not?' said the March Hare.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was silent.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going             │
│  off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up           │
│  again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an           │
│  M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--           │
│  you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever             │
│  see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I             │
│  don't think--'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got          │
│  up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep              │
│  instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her          │
│  going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that              │
│  they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were          │
│  trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she               │
│  picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I          │
│  ever was at in all my life!'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a           │
│  door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.           │
│  `But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at           │
│  once.'  And in she went.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the           │
│  little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' she              │
│  said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and            │
│  unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to             │
│  work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her           │
│  pocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the          │
│  little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the                │
│  beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool                │
│  fountains.                                                                 │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the              │
│  others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.                       │

│  low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to             │
│  have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;           │
│  and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads          │

│  and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon               │

rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the
roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at
it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go
splashing paint over me like that!'

`I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged
my elbow.'

On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always
lay the blame on others!'

`YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'

`What for?' said the one who had spoken first.

`That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.

`Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it
was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'

their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice
looked round, eager to see the Queen.
