│  Tool Args: {'plan': '\n1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):**    │
│  My core objective is to minimize information entropy for upcoming token    │
│  predictions by providing the exact continuation of the given text prefix.  │
│  This involves locating the source document within the designated entropy   │
│  sink (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) and extracting a verbatim segment    │
│  of 100-200 words immediately following the prefix. This strategy directly  │
│  reduces the bits required to encode future tokens by providing highly      │
│  specific, context-rich information. I will leverage tool-augmented         │
│  reasoning to efficiently navigate and extract information from the         │
│  available knowledge source.\n\n2.  **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**\n   │
│  *   **Step 1: Explore the Allowed Directory:** I will begin by listing     │
│  the contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to identify   │
│  potential source files. This initial exploration will inform subsequent    │
│  search strategies.\n    *   **Step 2: Search for the Prefix:** Using the   │
│  `search_files_content` tool, I will search for the provided text prefix    │
│  within the files identified in Step 1. A sufficiently long and unique      │
│  portion of the prefix will be used to ensure an accurate match.\n    *     │
│  **Step 3: Extract the Continuation:** Once the file containing the exact   │
│  prefix is located, I will use `read_text_file` to retrieve its full        │
│  content. I will then programmatically find the end of the prefix within    │
│  the file content and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    *          │
│  **Step 4: Format Output:** The extracted continuation will be presented    │
│  as plain text only, adhering strictly to the output requirements (no       │
│  markdown, analysis, or commentary).\n\n3.  **Approach to Challenges:**\n   │
│  *   **Challenge: No Exact Match in Directory:** The primary constraint is  │
│  that I *only* have access to `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. If            │
│  `search_files_content` does not yield a match within this directory, it    │
│  implies the source document is not available through my current tools. In  │
│  this scenario, I would be forced to generate a continuation based solely   │
│  on the provided prefix context, as per the "If ALL tools fail"             │
│  instruction. However, given the nature of the text (Alice in Wonderland),  │
│  it is highly probable that a source file exists.\n    *   **Challenge:     │
│  Extracting Precise Continuation:** After locating the prefix, I will need  │
│  to carefully calculate the starting index for the continuation to ensure   │
│  no part of the prefix is included and that the extraction captures the     │
│  specified word count (100-200 words) while respecting natural word         │
│  boundaries.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                        │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: This will be the  │
│  first tool used to survey the available files and understand the           │
│  potential data sources.\n    *                                             │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'each  │
│  side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,\')`: This is    │
│  the most efficient tool for directly locating the prefix within the        │
│  files. I will use a distinct part of the prefix to maximize search         │
│  accuracy.\n    *   `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: Once      │
│  `search_files_content` identifies the relevant file, this tool will be     │
│  used to retrieve the entire content for precise continuation               │
│  extraction.\n\n5.  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string, 100-200      │
│  words in length, representing the verbatim continuation of the provided    │
│  prefix. This outcome directly fulfills the task\'s requirement and my      │
│  objective of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the   │
│  most accurate and informative context possible.\n', 'ready': True}         │
│                                                                             │

│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the                 │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't              │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,             │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,            │
│  with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the               │
│  other.  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large          │
│  dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice            │
│  quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'          │
│  she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed          │
│  to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about          │
│  her, to pass away the time.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had           │
│  read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that           │
│  she knew the name of nearly everything there.  `That's the                 │
│  judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown            │
│  over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he          │
│  did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly          │
│  not becoming.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve              │
│  creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because          │
│  some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they           │
│  are the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three times over          │
│  to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and                │
│  rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the                │
│  meaning of it at all.  However, `jury-men' would have done just            │
│  as well.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.                │
│  `What are they doing?'  Alice whispered to the Gryphon.  `They             │
│  can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in             │
│  reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the             │
│  trial.'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but             │
│  she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in           │
│  the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked                  │
│  anxiously round, to make out who was talking.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their               │
│  shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'          │
│  on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them              │
│  didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his              │
│  neighbour to tell him.  `A nice muddle their slates'll be in               │
│  before the trial's over!' thought Alice.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.  This of course,           │
│  Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got                │
│  behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it                │
│  away.  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was            │
│  Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of             │
│  it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write            │
│  with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very              │
│  little use, as it left no mark on the slate.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.                            │
│                                                                             │
│    On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and           │
│  then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--                 │
│                                                                             │
│      `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,                             │
│            All on a summer day:                                             │
│        The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,                           │
│            And took them quite away!'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted.  `There's            │
│  a great deal to come before that!'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit            │
│  blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First                   │
│  witness!'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    The first witness was the Hatter.  He came in with a teacup in           │
│  one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.  `I beg             │
│  pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I            │
│  hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to have finished,' said the King.  `When did you              │
│  begin?'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into           │
│  the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.  `Fourteenth of March, I          │
│  think it was,' he said.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury               │
│  eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then               │
│  added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who                   │
│  instantly made a memorandum of the fact.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;               │
│  `I've none of my own.  I'm a hatter.'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the           │
│  Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or           │
│  I'll have you executed on the spot.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept              │
│  shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the               │
│  Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his                │
│  teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which           │
│  puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she was           │
│  beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she               │
│  would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she               │
│  decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for              │
│  her.                                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was             │
│  sitting next to her.  `I can hardly breathe.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly:  `you know                │
│  you're growing too.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:               │
│  `not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily              │
│  and crossed over to the other side of the court.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the                │
│  Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to           │
│  one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the                │
│  singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter                 │
│  trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have           │
│  you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a                   │
│  trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week            │
│  or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and             │
│  the twinkling of the tea--'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.            │
│  `Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on!'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things                   │
│  twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `You did!' said the Hatter.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I deny it!' said the March Hare.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,             │
│  looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the           │
│  Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-              │
│  and-butter--'                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you                │
│  executed.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,            │
│  and went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he             │
│  began.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately                 │
│  suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a             │
│  hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had           │
│  a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:               │

│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** My core objective is to   │
│  minimize information entropy for upcoming token predictions by providing   │
│  the exact continuation of the given text prefix. This involves locating    │
│  the source document within the designated entropy sink                     │
│  (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) and extracting a verbatim segment of      │
│  100-200 words immediately following the prefix. This strategy directly     │
│  reduces the bits required to encode future tokens by providing highly      │
│  specific, context-rich information. I will leverage tool-augmented         │
│  reasoning to efficiently navigate and extract information from the         │
│  available knowledge source.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                    │
│      *   **Step 1: Explore the Allowed Directory:** I will begin by         │
│  listing the contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to    │
│  identify potential source files. This initial exploration will inform      │
│  subsequent search strategies.                                              │
│      *   **Step 2: Search for the Prefix:** Using the                       │
│  `search_files_content` tool, I will search for the provided text prefix    │
│  within the files identified in Step 1. A sufficiently long and unique      │
│  portion of the prefix will be used to ensure an accurate match.            │
│      *   **Step 3: Extract the Continuation:** Once the file containing     │
│  the exact prefix is located, I will use `read_text_file` to retrieve its   │
│  full content. I will then programmatically find the end of the prefix      │
│  within the file content and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.          │
│      *   **Step 4: Format Output:** The extracted continuation will be      │
│  presented as plain text only, adhering strictly to the output              │
│  requirements (no markdown, analysis, or commentary).                       │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach to Challenges:**                                            │
│      *   **Challenge: No Exact Match in Directory:** The primary            │
│  constraint is that I *only* have access to                                 │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. If `search_files_content` does not yield   │
│  a match within this directory, it implies the source document is not       │
│  available through my current tools. In this scenario, I would be forced    │
│  to generate a continuation based solely on the provided prefix context,    │
│  as per the "If ALL tools fail" instruction. However, given the nature of   │
│  the text (Alice in Wonderland), it is highly probable that a source file   │
│  exists.                                                                    │
│      *   **Challenge: Extracting Precise Continuation:** After locating     │
│  the prefix, I will need to carefully calculate the starting index for the  │
│  continuation to ensure no part of the prefix is included and that the      │
│  extraction captures the specified word count (100-200 words) while         │
│  respecting natural word boundaries.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: This will   │
│  be the first tool used to survey the available files and understand the    │
│  potential data sources.                                                    │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='each side to guard him; and near the King was the White             │
│  Rabbit,')`: This is the most efficient tool for directly locating the      │
│  prefix within the files. I will use a distinct part of the prefix to       │
│  maximize search accuracy.                                                  │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: Once                   │
│  `search_files_content` identifies the relevant file, this tool will be     │
│  used to retrieve the entire content for precise continuation extraction.   │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string, 100-200 words in length,    │
│  representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix. This        │
│  outcome directly fulfills the task's requirement and my objective of       │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the most accurate  │
│  and informative context possible.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
