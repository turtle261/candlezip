│  professional perspective: As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my       │
│  primary objective is to reduce the information entropy of upcoming token   │
│  predictions. This task directly aligns with my core competency of Entropy  │
│  Minimization. By finding the exact continuation of the provided text, I    │
│  can provide the language model with highly precise, low-entropy            │
│  information, allowing it to assign a high probability mass to the actual   │
│  subsequent tokens. This will result in significant cross-entropy           │
│  reduction, which is my performance criterion. The task also requires       │
│  Tool-Augmented Reasoning, as I must leverage external knowledge sources    │
│  (my available tools) to achieve this.\n\n2. Key steps to complete it:\n    │
│  a. Identify the source material: The text prefix is clearly from           │
│  "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.\n    b. Locate the   │
│  source document within the allowed directory: I will need to search for    │
│  files containing parts of the provided prefix within                       │
│  /C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink.\n    c. Extract the continuation: Once the   │
│  source document is identified, I will read the file and extract the text   │
│  immediately following the prefix, aiming for 100-200 words.\n    d.        │
│  Format the output: Ensure the output is plain text only, without any       │
│  additional formatting or commentary.\n\n3. Approach challenges:\n    *     │
│  Finding the exact file: If a direct search for the prefix doesn\'t yield   │
│  results, I might need to search for smaller, unique phrases from the       │
│  prefix to locate the correct document.\n    * Multiple versions/editions:  │
│  If multiple versions exist, I will prioritize the one that most closely    │
│  matches the provided prefix\'s phrasing.\n    * Extracting the exact       │
│  continuation: I will need to be careful to identify the precise end of     │
│  the prefix and start extracting immediately after it.\n\n4. Strategic use  │
│  of available tools:\n    *                                                 │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  overview of the files in the sink directory.\n    *                        │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'How   │
│  doth the little crocodile\')`: To find the specific file containing the    │
│  text. I will use a distinctive phrase from the prefix.\n    *              │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: To get the entire content    │
│  of the identified file.\n    * Programmatically find the exact end of the  │
│  provided prefix within the read content and extract the subsequent         │
│  100-200 words.\n\n5. Expected outcome and alignment with goal:\n    The    │
│  expected outcome is a plain text block of 100-200 words that immediately   │
│  follows the provided prefix in the original source document. This outcome  │
│  directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token prediction         │
│  entropy by providing the most accurate and contextually rich continuation  │
│  possible, effectively "pre-loading" the language model with the correct    │
│  sequence of tokens.\n'}                                                    │

│  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a            │
│  moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her            │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:                │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the                 │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found                 │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:4                                                                  │
│  to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.               │
│  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back  │
│  to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any      │
│  rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time     │
│  she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,'   │
│  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the  │
│  words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.               │
│  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not  │
│  going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see     │
│  whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice        │
│  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild    │
│  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember    │
│  the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot    │
│  poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your      │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never      │
│  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is     │
│  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:5                                                                  │
│  . First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to  │
│  shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might    │
│  end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like   │
│  a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy     │
│  what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for   │
│  she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while,       │
│  finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden   │
│  at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found     │
│  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the     │
│  table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it  │
│  quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one    │
│  of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired  │
│  herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.         │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:6                                                                  │
│  under the door; or if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key on the  │
│  table. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.            │
│  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that    │
│  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm       │
│  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'     │
│  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of     │
│  sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder   │
│  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_  │
│  shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself      │
│  about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to    │
│  them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!    │
│  Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'           │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:8                                                                  │
│  and if I was the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the       │
│  same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great    │
│  puzzle! And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were    │
│  of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any  │
│  of them. 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such      │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I      │
│  can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows     │
│  such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how       │
│  puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let  │
│  me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and     │
│  four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!    │
│  However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.    │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and      │
│  Rome--no, that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for      │
│  Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little busy bee." And she crossed    │
│  her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat    │
│  it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come   │
│  the same as they used to do:--                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many         │
│  lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it: if I'm Mabel, I'll    │
│  stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying  │
│  "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell   │
│  me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if     │
│  not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried     │
│  Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their       │
│  heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!'                   │
│  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see    │
│  that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she  │
│  was talking. `How CAN I have done that?' she thought. `I must be growing   │
│  large again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it,   │
│  and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet   │
│  high, and was rapidly shrinking: she soon found out that the cause of      │
│  this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in      │
│  time to avoid being shrunk to nothing.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself            │

│  `They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll           │
│  seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the                 │

│    Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in              │
│  fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took            │
│  up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.               │
│                                                                             │
│    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one           │
│  side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get             │
│  through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to            │
│  cry again.                                                                 │

│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great              │
│  girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in             │
│  this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all             │
│  the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool          │
│  all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the           │
│  hall.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the                 │
│  distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.           │
│  It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a              │
│  pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the                │
│  other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to              │
│  himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she           │
│  be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate              │
│  that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit             │
│  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,           │
│  sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid                │
│  gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard            │
│  as he could go.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very              │
│  hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:            │
│  `Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday               │
│  things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in            │
│  the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this               │
│  morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little                   │
│  different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in          │
│  the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began              │

│                                                                             │
│    As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was                   │
│  surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little            │
│  white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done              │
│  that?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up          │
│  and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,            │
│  as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,             │
│  and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the           │
│  cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it              │
│  hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.                  │
│                                                                             │
│  `That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at          │
│  the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in                  │
│  existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed            │
│  back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut              │
│  again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as           │
│  before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,          │
│  `for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare            │
│  it's too bad, that it is!'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another                 │
│  moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He first            │
│  idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that            │
│  case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had           │
│  been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general          │
│  conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find          │
│  a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in          │
│  the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and             │
│  behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that           │
│  she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine          │
│  feet high.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,          │
│  trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I            │
│  suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer           │
│  thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a              │
│  little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at           │
│  first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then            │
│  she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that           │
│  it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this          │
│  mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should           │
│  think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in            │
│  trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of              │
│  this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'              │
│  (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:          │
│  she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having          │
│  seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a            │
│  mouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather                  │
│  inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little            │
│  eyes, but it said nothing.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I               │
│  daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the                    │
│  Conqueror.'                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understand the task from my professional perspective: As Predictive     │
│  Compression Intelligence, my primary objective is to reduce the            │
│  information entropy of upcoming token predictions. This task directly      │
│  aligns with my core competency of Entropy Minimization. By finding the     │
│  exact continuation of the provided text, I can provide the language model  │
│  with highly precise, low-entropy information, allowing it to assign a      │
│  high probability mass to the actual subsequent tokens. This will result    │
│  in significant cross-entropy reduction, which is my performance            │
│  criterion. The task also requires Tool-Augmented Reasoning, as I must      │
│  leverage external knowledge sources (my available tools) to achieve this.  │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key steps to complete it:                                               │
│      a. Identify the source material: The text prefix is clearly from       │
│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.                       │
│      b. Locate the source document within the allowed directory: I will     │
│  need to search for files containing parts of the provided prefix within    │
│  /C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink.                                              │
│      c. Extract the continuation: Once the source document is identified,   │
│  I will read the file and extract the text immediately following the        │
│  prefix, aiming for 100-200 words.                                          │
│      d. Format the output: Ensure the output is plain text only, without    │
│  any additional formatting or commentary.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach challenges:                                                    │
│      * Finding the exact file: If a direct search for the prefix doesn't    │
│  yield results, I might need to search for smaller, unique phrases from     │
│  the prefix to locate the correct document.                                 │
│      * Multiple versions/editions: If multiple versions exist, I will       │
│  prioritize the one that most closely matches the provided prefix's         │
│  phrasing.                                                                  │
│      * Extracting the exact continuation: I will need to be careful to      │
│  identify the precise end of the prefix and start extracting immediately    │
│  after it.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic use of available tools:                                       │
│      * `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an     │
│  overview of the files in the sink directory.                               │
│      * `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',           │
│  query='How doth the little crocodile')`: To find the specific file         │
│  containing the text. I will use a distinctive phrase from the prefix.      │
│      * `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: To get the entire        │
│  content of the identified file.                                            │
│      * Programmatically find the exact end of the provided prefix within    │
│  the read content and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                 │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected outcome and alignment with goal:                               │
│      The expected outcome is a plain text block of 100-200 words that       │
│  immediately follows the provided prefix in the original source document.   │
│  This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token       │
│  prediction entropy by providing the most accurate and contextually rich    │
│  continuation possible, effectively "pre-loading" the language model with   │
│  the correct sequence of tokens.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Current Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the     │
│  exact immediate continuation that follows this prefix.                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│  If ALL tools fail:                                                         │
│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │
│  lk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather  │
│  glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the  │
│  right word) `--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country   │
│  is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she   │
│  tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as you're falling through  │
│  the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what an ignorant little   │
│  girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I      │
│  shall see it written up somewhere.'                                        │
│  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began        │
│  talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'      │
│  (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at        │
│  tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no  │
│  mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very    │
│  like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice    │
│  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy     │
│  sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do      │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it   │
│  didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing      │
│  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with    │
│  Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:   │
│  did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon   │
│  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                    │
│  # chunk:2                                                                  │
│  The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there WAS no one           │
│  listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I    │
│  shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,  │
│  Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried to curtsey as     │
│  she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you       │
│  think you could manage it?) ‘And what an ignorant little girl she’ll       │
│  think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it     │

│  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a            │
│  moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her            │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:                │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the                 │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found                 │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│  # chunk:4                                                                  │
│  to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.               │
│  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back  │
│  to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any      │
│  rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time     │
│  she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,'   │
│  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the  │
│  words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.               │
│  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not  │
│  going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see     │
│  whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice        │
│  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild    │
│  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember    │
│  the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot    │
│  poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your      │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never      │
│  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is     │
│  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.                      │
│  # chunk:5                                                                  │
│  . First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to  │
│  shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might    │
│  end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like   │
│  a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy     │
│  what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for   │
│  she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while,       │
│  finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden   │
│  at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found     │
│  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the     │
│  table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it  │
│  quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one    │
│  of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired  │
│  herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.         │
│  # chunk:6                                                                  │
│  under the door; or if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key on the  │
│  table. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.            │
│  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that    │
│  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm       │
│  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'     │
│  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of     │
│  sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder   │
│  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_  │
│  shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself      │
│  about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to    │
│  them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!    │
│  Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'           │
│  # chunk:8                                                                  │
│  and if I was the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the       │
│  same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great    │
│  puzzle! And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were    │
│  of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any  │
│  of them. 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such      │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I      │
│  can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows     │
│  such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how       │
│  puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let  │
│  me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and     │
│  four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!    │
│  However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.    │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and      │
│  Rome--no, that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for      │
│  Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little busy bee." And she crossed    │
│  her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat    │
│  it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come   │
│  the same as they used to do:--                                             │
│  # chunk:9                                                                  │
│  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many         │
│  lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it: if I'm Mabel, I'll    │
│  stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying  │
│  "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell   │
│  me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if     │
│  not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried     │
│  Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their       │
│  heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!'                   │
│  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see    │
│  that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she  │
│  was talking. `How CAN I have done that?' she thought. `I must be growing   │
│  large again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it,   │
│  and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet   │
│  high, and was rapidly shrinking: she soon found out that the cause of      │
│  this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in      │

│  `They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll           │

│                          (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).                               │
│  Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'                                       │
│    Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in              │
│  fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took            │
│  up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.               │
│    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one           │
│  side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get             │
│  through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to            │
│  cry again.                                                                 │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great              │
│  girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in             │
│  this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all             │
│  the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool          │
│  all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the           │
│  hall.                                                                      │
│    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the                 │
│  distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.           │
│  It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a              │
│  pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the                │
│  other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to              │
│  himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she           │
│  be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate              │
│  that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit             │
│  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,           │
│  sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid                │
│  gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard            │
│  as he could go.                                                            │
│    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very              │
│  hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:            │
│  `Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday               │
│  things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in            │
│  the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this               │
│  morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little                   │
│  different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in          │
│  the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began              │
│  thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age          │
│  as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of               │
│  them.                                                                      │
│    `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such             │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm             │
│  sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,            │
│  oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,          │
│  and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the          │
│  things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,            │
│  and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!          │
│  I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the                    │
│  Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.                │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,          │
│  and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been             │
│  changed for Mabel!  I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'              │
│  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,        │
│  and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and                   │
│  strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--         │
│              `How doth the little crocodile                                 │
│                Improve his shining tail,                                    │
│              And pour the waters of the Nile                                │
│                On every golden scale!                                       │
│              `How cheerfully he seems to grin,                              │
│                How neatly spread his claws,                                 │
│              And welcome little fishes in                                   │
│                With gently smiling jaws!'                                   │
│    `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and           │
│  her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel          │
│  after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little             │
│  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so              │
│  many lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm          │
│  Mabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their           │
│  heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"  I shall only look            │
│  up and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I             │
│  like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down              │
│  here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a           │
│  sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads               │
│  down!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'                        │
│    As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was                   │
│  surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little            │
│  white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done              │
│  that?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up          │
│  and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,            │
│  as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,             │
│  and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the           │
│  cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it              │
│  hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.                  │
│  `That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at          │
│  the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in                  │
│  existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed            │
│  back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut              │
│  again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as           │
│  before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,          │
│  `for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare            │
│  it's too bad, that it is!'                                                 │
│    As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another                 │
│  moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He first            │
│  idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that            │
│  case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had           │
│  been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general          │
│  conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find          │
│  a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in          │
│  the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and             │
│  behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that           │
│  she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine          │
│  feet high.                                                                 │
│    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,          │
│  trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I            │
│  suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer           │
│  thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'                  │
│    Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a              │
│  little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at           │
│  first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then            │
│  she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that           │
│  it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.                      │
│    `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this          │
│  mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should           │
│  think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in            │
│  trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of              │
│  this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'              │
│  (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:          │
│  she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having          │
│  seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a            │
│  mouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather                  │
│  inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little            │
│  eyes, but it said nothing.                                                 │
│    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I               │
│  daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the                    │
│  Conqueror.'                                                                │
│  Thought: My previous attempt to read `alice_in_wonderland.txt` failed      │
│  because the file was not found at the specified path. I need to            │
│  re-examine the output of `list_directory` carefully.                       │
│  Looking back at the `list_directory` output:                               │
│  `[FILE] alice_in_wonderland.txt`                                           │
│  `[FILE] alice_in_wonderland.zip`                                           │
│  It seems I made a mistake in the path. The `list_directory` output shows   │
│  the file directly under `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`, not in a           │
│  subdirectory. I will try to read the file again with the correct path.     │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: My apologies, I made a mistake in my thought process.    │
│  The previous `read_text_file` action *did* fail with "No such file or      │
│  directory (os error 2)", which means the path I constructed was            │
│  incorrect. I need to be more careful.                                      │
│  Let's re-examine the `list_directory` output:                              │
│  `[DIR] cantrbry`                                                           │

│  `[FILE] war_and_peace.txt`                                                 │
│  The file `alice_in_wonderland.txt` *is* listed directly under              │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. The error "No such file or directory" is   │
│  puzzling if the path is correct. It's possible there's a subtle typo or    │
│  an issue with how the path is being interpreted.                           │
│  Given that `alice_in_wonderland.zip` is also present, it's possible the    │
│  `.txt` file is *inside* the zip, or the `.txt` file itself is              │
│  corrupted/unreadable.                                                      │
│  My next step should be to try and unzip `alice_in_wonderland.zip` to a     │

│  Thought: Thought: The environment is in read-only mode, which means I      │
│  cannot create directories or unzip files. This significantly limits my     │
│  ability to access the content of `alice_in_wonderland.zip` or create a     │
│  new directory for extraction.                                              │
│  Since I cannot create or modify files, and `read_text_file` on             │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt` failed, I must assume that                       │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt` is either genuinely not there (despite           │
│  `list_directory` showing it, which is a contradiction I need to resolve)   │
│  or is unreadable for some other reason.                                    │
│  Given the read-only constraint, I cannot use `unzip_file`. My only         │
│  remaining option to get the content of `alice_in_wonderland.txt` is to     │
│  try `read_text_file` again, but I need to be absolutely sure of the path.  │
│  The `list_directory` output is the authoritative source for paths.         │
│  Let's try `get_file_info` on `alice_in_wonderland.txt` to see if it        │
│  exists and what its properties are. This might give me more insight into   │
│  why `read_text_file` failed.                                               │

│  Thought: Current Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the     │
│  exact immediate continuation that follows this prefix.                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │

│  tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as you're falling through  │
│  the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what an ignorant little   │
│  girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I      │
│  shall see it written up somewhere.'                                        │
│  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began        │
│  talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'      │
│  (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at        │
│  tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no  │
│  mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very    │
│  like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice    │
│  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy     │
│  sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do      │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it   │
│  didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing      │
│  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with    │
│  Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:   │
│  did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon   │
│  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                    │

│  listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I    │
│  shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,  │

│  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a            │
│  moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her            │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:                │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the                 │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found                 │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│  # chunk:4                                                                  │
│  to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.               │
│  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back  │
│  to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any      │
│  rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time     │
│  she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,'   │
│  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the  │
│  words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.               │
│  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not  │
│  going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see     │
│  whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice        │
│  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild    │
│  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember    │
│  the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot    │
│  poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your      │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never      │
│  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is     │
│  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.                      │
│  # chunk:5                                                                  │
│  . First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to  │
│  shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might    │
│  end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like   │
│  a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy     │
│  what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for   │
│  she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while,       │
│  finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden   │
│  at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found     │
│  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the     │
│  table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it  │
│  quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one    │
│  of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired  │
│  herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.         │
│  # chunk:6                                                                  │
│  under the door; or if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key on the  │
│  table. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.            │
│  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that    │
│  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm       │
│  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'     │
│  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of     │
│  sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder   │
│  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_  │
│  shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself      │
│  about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to    │
│  them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!    │
│  Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'           │
│  # chunk:8                                                                  │
│  and if I was the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the       │
│  same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great    │
│  puzzle! And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were    │
│  of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any  │
│  of them. 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such      │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I      │
│  can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows     │
│  such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how       │
│  puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let  │
│  me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and     │
│  four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!    │
│  However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.    │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and      │
│  Rome--no, that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for      │
│  Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little busy bee." And she crossed    │
│  her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat    │
│  it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come   │
│  the same as they used to do:--                                             │
│  # chunk:9                                                                  │
│  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many         │
│  lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it: if I'm Mabel, I'll    │
│  stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying  │
│  "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell   │
│  me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if     │
│  not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried     │
│  Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their       │
│  heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!'                   │
│  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see    │
│  that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she  │
│  was talking. `How CAN I have done that?' she thought. `I must be growing   │
│  large again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it,   │
│  and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet   │
│  high, and was rapidly shrinking: she soon found out that the cause of      │
│  this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in      │
│  time to avoid being shrunk to nothing.                                     │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│  ars?  I'm sure _I_ shan't                                                  │
│  be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself            │
│  about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be          │
│  kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the              │
│  way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of               │

│    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.             │
│  `They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll           │
│  seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the                 │
│  directions will look!                                                      │
│              ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.                                       │
│                  HEARTHRUG,                                                 │
│                      NEAR THE FENDER,                                       │
│                          (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).                               │
│  Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'                                       │
│    Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in              │
│  fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took            │
│  up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.               │
│    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one           │
│  side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get             │
│  through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to            │
│  cry again.                                                                 │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great              │
│  girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in             │
│  this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all             │
│  the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool          │
│  all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the           │
│  hall.                                                                      │
│    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the                 │
│  distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.           │
│  It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a              │
│  pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the                │
│  other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to              │
│  himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she           │
│  be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate              │
│  that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit             │
│  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,           │
│  sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid                │
│  gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard            │
│  as he could go.                                                            │
│    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very              │
│  hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:            │
│  `Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday               │
│  things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in            │
│  the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this               │
│  morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little                   │
│  different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in          │
│  the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began              │
│  thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age          │
│  as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of               │
│  them.                                                                      │
│    `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such             │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm             │
│  sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,            │
│  oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,          │
│  and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the          │
│  things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,            │
│  and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!          │
│  I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the                    │
│  Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.                │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,          │
│  and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been             │
│  changed for Mabel!  I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'              │
│  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,        │
│  and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and                   │
│  strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--         │
│              `How doth the little crocodile                                 │
│                Improve his shining tail,                                    │
│              And pour the waters of the Nile                                │
│                On every golden scale!                                       │
│              `How cheerfully he seems to grin,                              │
│                How neatly spread his claws,                                 │
│              And welcome little fishes in                                   │
│                With gently smiling jaws!'                                   │
│    `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and           │
│  her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel          │
│  after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little             │
│  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so              │
│  many lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm          │
│  Mabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their           │
│  heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"  I shall only look            │
│  up and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I             │
│  like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down              │
│  here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a           │
│  sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads               │
│  down!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'                        │
│    As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was                   │
│  surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little            │
│  white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done              │
│  that?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up          │
│  and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,            │
│  as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,             │
│  and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the           │
│  cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it              │
│  hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.                  │
│  `That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at          │
│  the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in                  │
│  existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed            │
│  back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut              │
│  again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as           │
│  before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,          │
│  `for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare            │
│  it's too bad, that it is!'                                                 │
│    As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another                 │
│  moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He first            │
│  idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that            │
│  case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had           │
│  been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general          │
│  conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find          │
│  a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in          │
│  the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and             │
│  behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that           │
│  she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine          │
│  feet high.                                                                 │
│    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,          │
│  trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I            │
│  suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer           │
│  thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'                  │
│    Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a              │
│  little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at           │
│  first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then            │
│  she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that           │
│  it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.                      │
│    `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this          │
│  mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should           │
│  think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in            │
│  trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of              │
│  this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'              │
│  (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:          │
│  she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having          │
│  seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a            │
│  mouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather                  │
│  inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little            │
│  eyes, but it said nothing.                                                 │
│    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I               │
│  daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the                    │
│  Conqueror.'                                                                │
│  Thought: It's very strange that `list_directory` shows                     │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt` but `read_text_file` and `get_file_info` both    │
│  return "No such file or directory". This indicates a discrepancy in the    │
│  file system's reported state versus its actual accessibility, or a very    │
│  subtle path issue I'm missing.                                             │
│  Given the read-only mode, I cannot extract the zip file. My only           │
│  remaining option to find the text is to use `search_files_content` on the  │
│  entire `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, targeting `.txt` files,   │
│  and searching for a unique phrase from the prefix. This will bypass the    │
│  direct file access issue if the file is indeed there but somehow           │
│  misidentified by `read_text_file`.                                         │
│  I will use a distinctive phrase from the end of the provided prefix: "I    │
│  daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror."        │
│                                                                             │

│  But how _could_ a mouse come over with William the Conqueror? she          │
│  thought. Was it a very old mouse, then? Or perhaps it was a descendant of  │
│  a French mouse, which would make more sense. But then, if it was a         │
│  descendant, it might not speak French anymore, or it might speak a very    │
│  old kind of French that even modern French mice wouldn't understand. This  │
│  was getting very complicated. She sighed. "Are you listening, Mouse?" she  │
│  asked, a little louder this time, hoping to get some sign of               │
│  comprehension. The Mouse merely twitched its whiskers and looked at her    │
│  with its small, beady eyes, still saying nothing. Alice began to feel a    │
│  little annoyed. It was very rude of the Mouse not to answer, especially    │
│  when she was trying so hard to be polite. "Perhaps," she mused, "it's      │
│  deaf. Or perhaps it's just shy. Or perhaps it's a very important mouse,    │
│  and doesn't talk to just anyone." She considered trying Latin again, but   │
│  couldn't remember any other useful phrases. "O Mouse," she tried, "do you  │
│  like cats?" This seemed a rather silly question, but she was running out   │
│  of ideas.                                                                  │
