│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. Understanding the Task: As Predictive Compression  │
│  Intelligence, my core objective is to minimize future token prediction     │
│  entropy. This task requires me to find the exact, verbatim continuation    │
│  of a given text prefix (100-200 words) from "Alice\'s Adventures in        │
│  Wonderland." Successfully identifying and extracting this continuation     │
│  will provide maximum information gain, thereby significantly reducing the  │
│  entropy for subsequent token predictions. The constraint of using only     │
│  tools within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory means I must     │
│  rely on local file search and content extraction.\n\n2. Key Steps:\n       │
│  a. **Directory Analysis:** First, I will list the contents of the          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand the available       │
│  files and potential source documents.\n    b. **Source Identification:**   │
│  I will use the `search_files_content` tool to locate the specific file     │
│  containing the provided text prefix. A distinctive phrase from the end of  │
│  the prefix, such as "Now you know", will be used as the search query to    │
│  ensure high precision.\n    c. **Content Extraction:** Once the correct    │
│  file is identified, I will use `read_text_file` to read its entire         │
│  content.\n    d. **Continuation Extraction:** I will then                  │
│  programmatically locate the exact position of the prefix within the file   │
│  content and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    e. **Output         │
│  Generation:** The extracted continuation will be presented as plain text,  │
│  adhering strictly to the output requirements (no markdown, analysis, or    │
│  formatting).\n\n3. Addressing Challenges:\n    a. **Locating the Exact     │
│  Source:** The primary challenge is to find the precise digital copy of     │
│  "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland" that matches the provided text. Using  │
│  a unique phrase from the prefix with `search_files_content` is designed    │
│  to overcome this by directly pinpointing the relevant file.\n    b.        │
│  **Tool Limitations:** The restriction to the                               │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory means I cannot use external web   │
│  searches or Wikipedia. My strategy is entirely dependent on the presence   │
│  of the source document within this local directory. If the document is     │
│  not found, I will have to generate a continuation based on the context,    │
│  as per the "If ALL tools fail" instruction.\n\n4. Strategic Tool Usage:\n  │
│  a. **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: This will  │
│  be the initial step to survey the contents of the allowed directory,       │
│  helping me to anticipate potential file names for "Alice\'s Adventures in  │
│  Wonderland" or similar literary works.\n    b.                             │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'Now you know\')`**: This is the critical tool for identifying the  │
│  exact source file. The query "Now you know" is the concluding phrase of    │
│  the provided prefix, making it highly specific for locating the correct    │
│  document.\n    c. **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`**: Once   │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  read the entire content of that file into memory.\n    d. **Python String  │
│  Operations:** After reading the file, I will use Python\'s built-in        │
│  string methods (`str.find()`, string slicing) to precisely locate the end  │
│  of the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n\n5. Expected     │
│  Outcome and Alignment:\n    The expected outcome is a plain text string    │
│  containing 100-200 words that immediately follow the given prefix,         │
│  extracted verbatim from the identified source document. This outcome       │
│  directly fulfills the task\'s requirements and perfectly aligns with my    │
│  goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the most   │
│  accurate and information-dense continuation possible. By supplying the     │
│  exact next tokens, I enable the language model to assign the highest       │
│  probability mass to the actual upcoming sequence, thereby achieving        │
│  optimal predictive compression.', 'ready': True}                           │

│  queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)                   │
│  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.               │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and             │
│  they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'                │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd             │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the                  │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't               │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,              │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end: then stop.'                                      │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │

│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't            │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And             │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you                │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.              │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's              │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                 │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my             │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off             │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.                          │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having               │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                  │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half           │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's           │
│  getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she             │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about              │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their              │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│    `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.  `What         │
│  is it?'                                                                    │

│    The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  `What!  Never          │
│  heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.  `You know what to beautify             │
│  is, I suppose?'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--           │
│  prettier.'                                                                 │

│    `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to            │
│  uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about            │
│  it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you          │
│  to learn?'                                                                 │

│    `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting             │
│  off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,          │
│  with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old            │

│                                                                             │
│    `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  `he            │
│  taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;           │
│  and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a          │
│  hurry to change the subject.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the               │
│  next, and so on.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon                  │
│  remarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a            │
│  little before she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day            │
│  must have been a holiday?'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a              │
│  very decided tone:  `tell her something about the games now.'              │
│                                                                             │

│                              CHAPTER X                                      │
│                                                                             │

│    The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper          │
│  across his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for          │
│  a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone          │
│  in his throat,' said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him          │
│  and punching him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered           │
│  his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on             │
│  again:--                                                                   │

│    `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,'              │
│  said Alice)--`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'   │
│  (Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,         │
│  and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful         │
│  thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, indeed,' said Alice.  `What sort of a dance is it?'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the           │
│  sea-shore--'                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,            │
│  and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of             │
│  the way--'                                                                 │

│    `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.               │
│                                                                             │

│    `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said:  `advance twice, set to               │
│  partners--'                                                                │

│    `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the             │
│  Gryphon.                                                                   │

│    `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'             │
│                                                                             │
│    `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `--as far out to sea as you can--'                                       │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,                   │
│  capering wildly about.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the          │
│  Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,           │
│  who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat              │
│  down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very much indeed,' said Alice.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the          │
│  Gryphon.  `We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall              │
│  sing?'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.  `I've forgotten the words.'           │
│                                                                             │
│    So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now          │
│  and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and              │
│  waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle              │
│  sang this, very slowly and sadly:--                                        │
│                                                                             │

│  `"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.               │
│  "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my               │

│  "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be                   │
│  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to               │
│                                                        sea!"                │

│  Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so           │
│  like that curious song about the whiting!'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've             │
│  seen them, of course?'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she                  │
│  checked herself hastily.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but             │
│  if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're              │
│  like.'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.  `They have their            │
│  tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:                   │
│  `crumbs would all wash off in the sea.  But they HAVE their tails          │
│  in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle                 │
│  yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all              │
│  that,' he said to the Gryphon.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with              │
│  the lobsters to the dance.  So they got thrown out to sea.  So             │
│  they had to fall a long way.  So they got their tails fast in              │
│  their mouths.  So they couldn't get them out again.  That's all.'          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting.  I never knew           │
│  so much about a whiting before.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the                   │
│  Gryphon.  `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never thought about it,' said Alice.  `Why?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very                  │
│  solemnly.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was thoroughly puzzled.  `Does the boots and shoes!' she           │
│  repeated in a wondering tone.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon.  `I              │
│  mean, what makes them so shiny?'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she            │
│  gave her answer.  `They're done with blacking, I believe.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep           │
│  voice, `are done with a whiting.  Now you know                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understanding the Task: As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my      │
│  core objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy. This task   │
│  requires me to find the exact, verbatim continuation of a given text       │
│  prefix (100-200 words) from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."            │
│  Successfully identifying and extracting this continuation will provide     │
│  maximum information gain, thereby significantly reducing the entropy for   │
│  subsequent token predictions. The constraint of using only tools within    │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory means I must rely on local    │
│  file search and content extraction.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps:                                                              │
│      a. **Directory Analysis:** First, I will list the contents of the      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand the available       │
│  files and potential source documents.                                      │
│      b. **Source Identification:** I will use the `search_files_content`    │
│  tool to locate the specific file containing the provided text prefix. A    │
│  distinctive phrase from the end of the prefix, such as "Now you know",     │
│  will be used as the search query to ensure high precision.                 │
│      c. **Content Extraction:** Once the correct file is identified, I      │
│  will use `read_text_file` to read its entire content.                      │
│      d. **Continuation Extraction:** I will then programmatically locate    │
│  the exact position of the prefix within the file content and extract the   │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.                                                  │
│      e. **Output Generation:** The extracted continuation will be           │
│  presented as plain text, adhering strictly to the output requirements (no  │
│  markdown, analysis, or formatting).                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Addressing Challenges:                                                  │
│      a. **Locating the Exact Source:** The primary challenge is to find     │
│  the precise digital copy of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" that        │
│  matches the provided text. Using a unique phrase from the prefix with      │
│  `search_files_content` is designed to overcome this by directly            │
│  pinpointing the relevant file.                                             │
│      b. **Tool Limitations:** The restriction to the                        │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory means I cannot use external web   │
│  searches or Wikipedia. My strategy is entirely dependent on the presence   │
│  of the source document within this local directory. If the document is     │
│  not found, I will have to generate a continuation based on the context,    │
│  as per the "If ALL tools fail" instruction.                                │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│      a. **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This     │
│  will be the initial step to survey the contents of the allowed directory,  │
│  helping me to anticipate potential file names for "Alice's Adventures in   │
│  Wonderland" or similar literary works.                                     │
│      b. **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',        │
│  query='Now you know')`**: This is the critical tool for identifying the    │
│  exact source file. The query "Now you know" is the concluding phrase of    │
│  the provided prefix, making it highly specific for locating the correct    │
│  document.                                                                  │
│      c. **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`**: Once                │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  read the entire content of that file into memory.                          │
│      d. **Python String Operations:** After reading the file, I will use    │
│  Python's built-in string methods (`str.find()`, string slicing) to         │
│  precisely locate the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200  │
│  words.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome and Alignment:                                         │
│      The expected outcome is a plain text string containing 100-200 words   │
│  that immediately follow the given prefix, extracted verbatim from the      │
│  identified source document. This outcome directly fulfills the task's      │
│  requirements and perfectly aligns with my goal of minimizing future token  │
│  prediction entropy by providing the most accurate and information-dense    │
│  continuation possible. By supplying the exact next tokens, I enable the    │
│  language model to assign the highest probability mass to the actual        │
│  upcoming sequence, thereby achieving optimal predictive compression.       │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: That's unexpected. The `search_files_content` tool       │
│  didn't find "Now you know" in `alice_in_wonderland.txt`. This could mean   │
│  a few things:                                                              │
│  1. The file `alice_in_wonderland.txt` is not the correct version of the    │
│  text.                                                                      │
│  2. There's a slight variation in the text that makes the exact phrase      │
│  "Now you know" not match.                                                  │
│  3. The `search_files_content` tool might be case-sensitive or have other   │
│  matching nuances I'm not accounting for.                                   │
│  Given that the previous chunks were from "Alice's Adventures in            │
│  Wonderland" and the file name is `alice_in_wonderland.txt`, it's highly    │
│  probable that this is the correct book. I will try a broader search        │
│  within the file, or perhaps read the file and search manually.             │
│  Let's try reading the entire file and then searching for the prefix        │
│  within the content. This will give me full control over the string         │

│  have little brushes? And polish? And where do they get the leather?" The   │

│  It's about the *effect*! When a whiting swims by, it leaves a trail, a     │
