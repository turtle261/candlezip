│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Understand the task from my       │
│  professional perspective:** As Predictive Compression Intelligence, my     │
│  core objective is to minimize information entropy for upcoming token       │
│  predictions. This task requires me to find the exact continuation of a     │
│  given text prefix, which directly aligns with my ENTROPY MINIMIZATION      │
│  competency. By providing the verbatim continuation from the source, I can  │
│  ensure the highest possible probability mass is assigned to the actual     │
│  next tokens, thereby significantly reducing cross-entropy. The text        │
│  appears to be from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland," a widely           │
│  available public domain work, making the task of finding the exact source  │
│  highly feasible.\n\n2. **Key steps to complete it:**\n    *   **Confirm    │
│  directory access:** Verify access to the allowed directory                 │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    *   **Directory analysis:** Obtain a  │
│  directory tree to understand the file structure and identify potential     │
│  source files.\n    *   **Source document identification:** Search for a    │
│  text file containing the provided prefix, specifically using a unique      │
│  phrase from the end of the prefix to pinpoint the exact location.\n    *   │
│  **Prefix location:** Once the document is identified, locate the exact     │
│  provided prefix within its content.\n    *   **Continuation extraction:**  │
│  Extract the immediate continuation (approximately 100-200 words) that      │
│  follows the prefix verbatim.\n    *   **Output formatting:** Ensure the    │
│  extracted continuation is presented as plain text only, without any        │
│  additional formatting, markdown, or commentary.\n\n3. **Approach any       │
│  challenges:**\n    *   **Document not found within allowed directory:**    │
│  If the source document is not found using `search_files_content` within    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`, I will re-evaluate the search query for    │
│  variations or try broader searches if permitted. However, the prompt       │
│  strictly limits access to this directory, so if it\'s not there, I would   │
│  be forced to generate a continuation based on context, which is a last     │
│  resort and would result in higher entropy. Given the nature of the text,   │
│  it is highly probable that a copy exists.\n    *   **Prefix not found      │
│  exactly:** If the document is found but the exact prefix is not present    │
│  (e.g., due to different editions or minor text variations), I will         │
│  attempt to find the closest matching segment and infer the most likely     │
│  continuation, prioritizing accuracy and relevance.\n    *   **Tool         │
│  limitations:** I will ensure that the `search_files_content` and           │
│  `read_text_file` tools are used efficiently to locate and extract the      │
│  required information, being mindful of their specific functionalities and  │
│  argument requirements.\n\n4. **Strategic use of available tools:**\n    *  │
│  **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the accessible directory.\n   │
│  *   **`directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: To get    │
│  an initial overview of the files in the target directory.\n    *           │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'poky little\')`**: This is the primary tool for locating the       │
│  source file. I will use the phrase "poky little" from the very end of the  │
│  provided prefix as it is specific enough to likely identify the correct    │
│  document and the exact point within it.\n    *                             │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`**: Once                     │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, I will use this tool to read   │
│  the entire content of that file.\n    *   **Internal string processing:**  │
│  After reading the file content, I will use Python\'s string manipulation   │
│  methods (e.g., `find()`, slicing) to locate the exact prefix and extract   │
│  the subsequent 100-200 words.\n\n5. **Expected outcome and alignment with  │
│  goal:** The expected outcome is a plain text string containing the         │
│  verbatim continuation of the provided prefix, approximately 100-200 words  │
│  long. This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future       │
│  token prediction entropy by providing the most accurate and context-rich   │
│  information possible, enabling the language model to make highly           │
│  confident predictions for the subsequent tokens.'}                         │

│  new, and say `Oh, what a clever girl I am!') `I wonder if I shall fall     │
│  right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the        │
│  people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--'    │
│  (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't   │
│  sound at all the right word) `--but I shall have to ask them what the      │
│  name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or    │
│  Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as    │
│  you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And    │
│  what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never   │
│  do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'                   │
│  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began        │
│  talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'      │
│  (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at        │
│  tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no  │
│  mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very    │
│  like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice    │
│  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy     │
│  sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do      │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it   │
│  didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing      │
│  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with    │
│  Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:   │
│  did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon   │
│  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there WAS no one           │
│  listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I    │
│  shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,  │

│  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a            │
│  moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her            │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:                │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the                 │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found                 │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:4                                                                  │
│  to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.               │
│  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back  │
│  to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any      │
│  rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time     │
│  she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,'   │
│  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the  │
│  words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.               │
│  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not  │
│  going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see     │
│  whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice        │
│  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild    │
│  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember    │
│  the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot    │
│  poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your      │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never      │
│  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is     │
│  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:5                                                                  │
│  . First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to  │
│  shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might    │
│  end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like   │
│  a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy     │
│  what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for   │
│  she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while,       │
│  finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden   │
│  at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found     │
│  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the     │
│  table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it  │
│  quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one    │
│  of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired  │
│  herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.         │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:6                                                                  │
│  under the door; or if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key on the  │
│  table. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.            │
│  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that    │
│  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm       │
│  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'     │
│  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of     │
│  sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder   │
│  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_  │
│  shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself      │
│  about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to    │
│  them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!    │
│  Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'           │
│                                                                             │

│  and if I was the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the       │
│  same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great    │
│  puzzle! And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were    │
│  of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any  │
│  of them. 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such      │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I      │
│  can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows     │
│  such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how       │
│  puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let  │
│  me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and     │
│  four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!    │
│  However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.    │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and      │
│  Rome--no, that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for      │
│  Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little busy bee." And she crossed    │
│  her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat    │
│  it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come   │
│  the same as they used to do:--                                             │
│                                                                             │

│    And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and             │
│  her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right           │
│  size for going though the little door into that lovely garden.             │
│  First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was             │
│  going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about              │

│    `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to                │
│  herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'          │
│  She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very              │
│  seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so                  │
│  severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered          │
│  trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game            │
│  of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious               │
│  child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no          │
│  use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,          │
│  there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable                   │
│  person!'                                                                   │

│    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under             │
│  the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on           │
│  which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.              │
│  `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,          │
│  I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep          │
│  under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I              │
│  don't care which happens!'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which              │
│  way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to              │
│  feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to              │
│  find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally          │
│  happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the             │
│  way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,              │
│  that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the              │
│  common way.                                                                │

│  be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself            │
│  about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be          │
│  kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the              │
│  way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of               │
│  boots every Christmas.'                                                    │

│    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.             │
│  `They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll           │
│  seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the                 │

│                      NEAR THE FENDER,                                       │
│                          (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).                               │

│  Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in              │
│  fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took            │
│  up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.               │
│                                                                             │
│    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one           │
│  side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get             │
│  through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to            │
│  cry again.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great              │
│  girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in             │
│  this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all             │
│  the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool          │
│  all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the           │
│  hall.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the                 │
│  distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.           │
│  It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a              │
│  pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the                │
│  other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to              │
│  himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she           │
│  be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate              │
│  that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit             │
│  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,           │
│  sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid                │
│  gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard            │
│  as he could go.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very              │
│  hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:            │
│  `Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday               │
│  things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in            │
│  the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this               │
│  morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little                   │
│  different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in          │
│  the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began              │
│  thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age          │
│  as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of               │
│  them.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such             │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm             │
│  sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,            │
│  oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,          │
│  and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the          │
│  things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,            │
│  and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!          │
│  I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the                    │
│  Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.                │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,          │
│  and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been             │
│  changed for Mabel!  I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'              │
│  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,        │
│  and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and                   │
│  strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--         │
│                                                                             │
│              `How doth the little crocodile                                 │
│                Improve his shining tail,                                    │
│              And pour the waters of the Nile                                │
│                On every golden scale!                                       │
│                                                                             │
│              `How cheerfully he seems to grin,                              │
│                How neatly spread his claws,                                 │

│                With gently smiling jaws!'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and           │
│  her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel          │
│  after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the task from my professional perspective:** As            │
│  Predictive Compression Intelligence, my core objective is to minimize      │
│  information entropy for upcoming token predictions. This task requires me  │
│  to find the exact continuation of a given text prefix, which directly      │
│  aligns with my ENTROPY MINIMIZATION competency. By providing the verbatim  │
│  continuation from the source, I can ensure the highest possible            │
│  probability mass is assigned to the actual next tokens, thereby            │
│  significantly reducing cross-entropy. The text appears to be from          │
│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," a widely available public domain       │
│  work, making the task of finding the exact source highly feasible.         │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key steps to complete it:**                                           │
│      *   **Confirm directory access:** Verify access to the allowed         │
│  directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                                  │
│      *   **Directory analysis:** Obtain a directory tree to understand the  │
│  file structure and identify potential source files.                        │
│      *   **Source document identification:** Search for a text file         │
│  containing the provided prefix, specifically using a unique phrase from    │
│  the end of the prefix to pinpoint the exact location.                      │
│      *   **Prefix location:** Once the document is identified, locate the   │
│  exact provided prefix within its content.                                  │
│      *   **Continuation extraction:** Extract the immediate continuation    │
│  (approximately 100-200 words) that follows the prefix verbatim.            │
│      *   **Output formatting:** Ensure the extracted continuation is        │
│  presented as plain text only, without any additional formatting,           │
│  markdown, or commentary.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach any challenges:**                                            │
│      *   **Document not found within allowed directory:** If the source     │
│  document is not found using `search_files_content` within                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`, I will re-evaluate the search query for    │
│  variations or try broader searches if permitted. However, the prompt       │
│  strictly limits access to this directory, so if it's not there, I would    │
│  be forced to generate a continuation based on context, which is a last     │
│  resort and would result in higher entropy. Given the nature of the text,   │
│  it is highly probable that a copy exists.                                  │
│      *   **Prefix not found exactly:** If the document is found but the     │
│  exact prefix is not present (e.g., due to different editions or minor      │
│  text variations), I will attempt to find the closest matching segment and  │
│  infer the most likely continuation, prioritizing accuracy and relevance.   │
│      *   **Tool limitations:** I will ensure that the                       │
│  `search_files_content` and `read_text_file` tools are used efficiently to  │
│  locate and extract the required information, being mindful of their        │
│  specific functionalities and argument requirements.                        │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic use of available tools:**                                   │
│      *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: To confirm the accessible        │
│  directory.                                                                 │
│      *   **`directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get  │
│  an initial overview of the files in the target directory.                  │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='poky little')`**: This is the primary tool for locating the source  │
│  file. I will use the phrase "poky little" from the very end of the         │
│  provided prefix as it is specific enough to likely identify the correct    │
│  document and the exact point within it.                                    │
│      *   **`read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`**: Once               │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, I will use this tool to read   │
│  the entire content of that file.                                           │
│      *   **Internal string processing:** After reading the file content, I  │
│  will use Python's string manipulation methods (e.g., `find()`, slicing)    │
│  to locate the exact prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.       │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected outcome and alignment with goal:** The expected outcome is   │
│  a plain text string containing the verbatim continuation of the provided   │
│  prefix, approximately 100-200 words long. This outcome directly aligns     │
│  with my goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing    │
│  the most accurate and context-rich information possible, enabling the      │
│  language model to make highly confident predictions for the subsequent     │
│  tokens.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The task requires me to find the exact continuation of   │
│  the provided text prefix. The text appears to be from "Alice's Adventures  │
│  in Wonderland." My strategy is to first confirm the allowed directory,     │
│  then list its contents to get an idea of the file structure, and finally   │
│  use `search_files_content` to locate the specific file containing the      │
│  prefix. Once the file is found, I will read its content and extract the    │
