│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understanding the Task from a SIMDL Perspective:**                   │
│      My primary objective is to minimize the information entropy for        │
│  upcoming token predictions. The task requires me to find the exact         │
│  immediate continuation of a given text prefix. From the Sink-Inclusive     │
│  Description Length (SIMDL) framework, this means identifying and           │
│  accessing an "entropy sink" (an external information source, in this       │
│  case, a file within the specified directory) that contains the prefix. By  │
│  retrieving the verbatim continuation, I provide maximally informative      │
│  context, allowing the language model to assign a very high probability to  │
│  the actual subsequent tokens, thereby significantly reducing the expected  │
│  description length. The cost associated is the computational effort of     │
│  searching the file system.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                    │
│      *   **Initial Directory Scan:** First, I will inspect the allowed      │
│  directory to understand its structure and contents, looking for files      │
│  that might contain literary works.                                         │
│      *   **Content Search:** I will use the provided text prefix as a       │
│  precise query to search for the exact string within all accessible files   │
│  in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.                           │
│      *   **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, I     │
│  will read its content, locate the exact position of the prefix, and then   │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.                             │
│      *   **Output Generation:** The extracted text will be presented as     │
│  plain text, without any additional formatting or commentary, as specified  │
│  by the task.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach to Challenges:**                                            │
│      *   **Limited External Access:** The most significant challenge is     │
│  the strict limitation to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.     │
│  This means I cannot use general web search engines or Wikipedia as         │
│  initially suggested in the general operational strategy. My "external      │
│  knowledge sources" are exclusively the files within this specific          │
│  directory. My approach will be to rely entirely on the file system tools   │
│  provided.                                                                  │
│      *   **Exact Match Requirement:** The task emphasizes "exact immediate  │
│  continuation." This necessitates precise string matching and careful       │
│  extraction to ensure no deviation from the source text.                    │
│      *   **Unknown File Structure:** I will use `directory_tree` to         │
│  quickly ascertain the file organization within the sink, which will        │
│  inform subsequent search strategies.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│                                                                             │
│      *   **Step 1: Confirm Allowed Directory:**                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │

│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  If ALL tools fail:                                                         │
│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │

│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't           │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And            │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you               │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.             │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's             │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:75                                                                 │
│  of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!'                 │
│  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse    │
│  turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had     │
│  disappeared.                                                               │
│  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. `Call the next   │
│  witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, `Really, my dear,     │
│  YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead        │
│  ache!'                                                                     │
│  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very   │
│  curious to see what the next witness would be like, `--for they haven't    │
│  got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when    │
│  the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the      │
│  name `Alice!'                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:76                                                                 │
│  to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that it         │
│  signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it would be QUITE    │
│  as much use in the trial one way up as the other.' As soon as the jury     │
│  had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates     │
│  and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very  │
│  diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard,  │
│  who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,   │
│  gazing up into the roof of the court. `Silence in the court!' shouted the  │
│  King, the White Rabbit flew into a passion, and cried out `Silence!        │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Current document prefix (UTF-8 text):                                      │
│  I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:                           │
│  `not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily              │
│  and crossed over to the other side of the court.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the                │
│  Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to           │
│  one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the                │
│  singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter                 │
│  trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have           │
│  you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a                   │
│  trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week            │
│  or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and             │
│  the twinkling of the tea--'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.            │
│  `Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on!'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things                   │
│  twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `You did!' said the Hatter.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I deny it!' said the March Hare.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,             │
│  looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the           │
│  Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-              │
│  and-butter--'                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you                │
│  executed.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,            │
│  and went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he             │
│  began.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately                 │
│  suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a             │
│  hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had           │
│  a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:               │
│  into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat            │
│  upon it.)                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often           │
│  read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some              │
│  attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the              │
│  officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant               │
│  till now.'                                                                 │

│    `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'                   │
│  continued the King.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as           │
│  it is.'                                                                    │

│    `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.  `Now we           │
│  shall get on better.'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious             │

│                                                                             │
│    `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the           │
│  court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one           │
│  of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the               │
│  officer could get to the door.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Call the next witness!' said the King.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the                │
│  pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before          │
│  she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began          │
│  sneezing all at once.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Give your evidence,' said the King.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Shan't,' said the cook.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a             │
│  low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy              │
│  air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till             │
│  his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What          │
│  are tarts made of?'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that            │
│  Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch          │
│  him!  Off with his whiskers!'                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the           │
│  Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down                │
│  again, the cook had disappeared.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.                │
│  `Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the              │
│  Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.          │
│  It quite makes my forehead ache!'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,              │
│  feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,           │
│  `--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.           │
│  Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top           │
│  of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'                              │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                             CHAPTER XII                                     │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the               │
│  moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she            │
│  jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with           │
│  the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads           │
│  of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding          │
│  her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset            │
│  the week before.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great                │
│  dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,           │
│  for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and             │
│  she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once           │
│  and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave                │
│  voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--            │
│  ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as            │
│  he said do.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she            │
│  had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing            │
│  was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable          │
│  to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that           │
│  it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it                │
│  would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'          │
│                                                                             │
│    As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of             │
│  being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and               │
│  handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write             │
│  out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed           │
│  too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,              │
│  gazing up into the roof of the court.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `What do you know about this business?' the King said to                 │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing,' said Alice.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.             │
│  They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when          │
│  the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,           │
│  of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and            │
│  making faces at him as he spoke.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and            │
│  went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--              │
│  unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word                  │
│  sounded best.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some                     │
│  `unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to            │
│  look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she                 │
│  thought to herself.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily               │
│  writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out              │
│  from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE              │
│  HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Everybody looked at Alice.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `You are,' said the King.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `                         │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1.  **Understanding the Task from a SIMDL Perspective:**                   │
│      My primary objective is to minimize the information entropy for        │
│  upcoming token predictions. The task requires me to find the exact         │
│  immediate continuation of a given text prefix. From the Sink-Inclusive     │
│  Description Length (SIMDL) framework, this means identifying and           │
│  accessing an "entropy sink" (an external information source, in this       │
│  case, a file within the specified directory) that contains the prefix. By  │
│  retrieving the verbatim continuation, I provide maximally informative      │
│  context, allowing the language model to assign a very high probability to  │
│  the actual subsequent tokens, thereby significantly reducing the expected  │
│  description length. The cost associated is the computational effort of     │
│  searching the file system.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**                                    │
│      *   **Initial Directory Scan:** First, I will inspect the allowed      │
│  directory to understand its structure and contents, looking for files      │
│  that might contain literary works.                                         │
│      *   **Content Search:** I will use the provided text prefix as a       │
│  precise query to search for the exact string within all accessible files   │
│  in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.                           │
│      *   **Verbatim Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, I     │
│  will read its content, locate the exact position of the prefix, and then   │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim.                             │
│      *   **Output Generation:** The extracted text will be presented as     │
│  plain text, without any additional formatting or commentary, as specified  │
│  by the task.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach to Challenges:**                                            │
│      *   **Limited External Access:** The most significant challenge is     │
│  the strict limitation to the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.     │
│  This means I cannot use general web search engines or Wikipedia as         │
│  initially suggested in the general operational strategy. My "external      │

And he got up very sulkily\nand crossed over to the other side of the court.\n\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the\nHatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to\none of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the\nsingers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter\ntrembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\n\n`Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have\nyou executed, whether you're nervous or not.'\n\n`I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a\ntrembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week\nor so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and\nthe twinkling of the tea--'\n\n`The twinkling of the what?' said the King.\n\n`It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\n\n`Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.\n`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'\n\n`I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things\ntwinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'\n\n`I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\n`You did!' said the Hatter.\n\n`I deny it!' said the March Hare.\n\n`He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'\n\n`Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,\nlooking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the\nDormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.\n\n`After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-\nand-butter--'\n\n`But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\n\n`That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\n\n`You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you\nexecuted.'\n\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,\nand went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he\nbegan.\n\n`You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\n\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately\nsuppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a\nhard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had\na large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:\ninto this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat\nupon it.)\n\n`I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often\nread in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some\nattempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the\nofficers of the court,\" and I never understood what it meant\ntill now.'\n\n`If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'\ncontinued the King.\n\n`I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as\nit is.'\n\n`Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.\n\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\n`Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we\nshall get on better.'\n\n`I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious\nlook at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n\n`You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the\ncourt, without even waiting to put his shoes on.\n\n`--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one\nof the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the\nofficer could get to the door.\n\n`Call the next witness!' said the King.\n\nThe next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the\npepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before\nshe got into the court, by the way the people near the door began\nsneezing all at once.\n\n`Give your evidence,' said the King.\n\n`Shan't,' said the cook.\n\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a\nlow voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'\n\n`Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy\nair, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till\nhis eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What\nare tarts made of?'\n\n`Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.\n\n`Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.\n\n`Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that\nDormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch\nhim! Off with his whiskers!'\n\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the\nDormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down\nagain, the cook had disappeared.\n\n`Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.\n`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the\nQueen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.\nIt quite makes my forehead ache!'\n\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,\nfeeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,\n`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.\nImagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top\nof his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'\n\n\n                           CHAPTER XII\n\n                        Alice's Evidence\n\n\n`Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the\nmoment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she\njumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with\nthe edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads\nof the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding\nher very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset\nthe week before.\n\n`Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great\ndismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,\nfor the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and\nshe had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once\nand put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\n\n`The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave\nvoice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--\nALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as\nhe said do.\n\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she\nhad put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing\nwas waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable\nto move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that\nit signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it\nwould be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'\n\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of\nbeing upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and\nhanded back to them, they set to work very diligently to write\nout a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed\ntoo much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,\ngazing up into the roof of the court.\n\n`What do you know about this business?' the King said to\nAlice.\n\n`Nothing,' said Alice.\n\n`Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.\n\n`Nothing whatever,' said Alice.\n\n`That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.\nThey were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when\nthe White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,\nof course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and\nmaking faces at him as he spoke.\n\n`UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and\nwent on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--\nunimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word\nsounded best.\n\nSome of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some\n`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to\nlook over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she\nthought to herself.\n\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily\nwriting in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out\nfrom his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE\nHIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'\n\nEverybody looked at Alice.\n\n`I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.\n\n`You are,' said the King.\n\n`Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.\n\n`Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `"}

│  sat\\nupon it.)\\n\\n`I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've  │
│  so often\\nread in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \\\"There was     │
│  some\\nattempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by           │
│  the\\nofficers of the court,\\\" and I never understood what it            │
│  meant\\ntill now.'\\n\\n`If that's all you know about it, you may stand    │
│  down,'\\ncontinued the King.\\n\\n`I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  │
│  `I'm on the floor, as\\nit is.'\\n\\n`Then you may SIT down,' the King     │
│  replied.\\n\\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was                   │
│  suppressed.\\n\\n`Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.     │
│  `Now we\\nshall get on better.'\\n\\n`I'd rather finish my tea,' said the  │
│  Hatter, with an anxious\\nlook at the Queen, who was reading the list of   │
│  singers.\\n\\n`You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left   │
│  the\\ncourt, without even waiting to put his shoes on.\\n\\n`--and just    │
│  take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one\\nof the officers: but  │
│  the Hatter was out of sight before the\\nofficer could get to the          │
│  door.\\n\\n`Call the next witness!' said the King.\\n\\nThe next witness   │
│  was the Duchess's cook. She carried the\\npepper-box in her hand, and      │
│  Alice guessed who it was, even before\\nshe got into the court, by the     │
│  way the people near the door began\\nsneezing all at once.\\n\\n`Give      │
│  your evidence,' said the King.\\n\\n`Shan't,' said the cook.\\n\\nThe      │
│  King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a\\nlow voice,      │
│  `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'\\n\\n`Well, if I must, I   │
│  must,' the King said, with a melancholy\\nair, and, after folding his      │
│  arms and frowning at the cook till\\nhis eyes were nearly out of sight,    │
│  he said in a deep voice, `What\\nare tarts made of?'\\n\\n`Pepper,         │
│  mostly,' said the cook.\\n\\n`Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind         │
│  her.\\n\\n`Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead          │
│  that\\nDormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him!            │
│  Pinch\\nhim! Off with his whiskers!'\\n\\nFor some minutes the whole       │
│  court was in confusion, getting the\\nDormouse turned out, and, by the     │
│  time they had settled down\\nagain, the cook had disappeared.\\n\\n`Never  │
│  mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.\\n`Call the next        │
│  witness.' And he added in an undertone to the\\nQueen, `Really, my dear,   │
│  YOU must cross-examine the next witness.\\nIt quite makes my forehead      │
│  ache!'\\n\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the          │
│  list,\\nfeeling very curious to see what the next witness would be         │
│  like,\\n`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to            │
│  herself.\\nImagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the    │
│  top\\nof his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'\\n\\n\\n               │
│  CHAPTER XII\\n\\n                        Alice's Evidence\\n\\n\\n`Here!'  │
│  cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the\\nmoment how large she  │
│  had grown in the last few minutes, and she\\njumped up in such a hurry     │
│  that she tipped over the jury-box with\\nthe edge of her skirt, upsetting  │
│  all the jurymen on to the heads\\nof the crowd below, and there they lay   │
│  sprawling about, reminding\\nher very much of a globe of goldfish she had  │
│  accidentally upset\\nthe week before.\\n\\n`Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she    │
│  exclaimed in a tone of great\\ndismay, and began picking them up again as  │
│  quickly as she could,\\nfor the accident of the goldfish kept running in   │
│  her head, and\\nshe had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected   │
│  at once\\nand put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\\n\\n`The     │
│  trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave\\nvoice, `until all   │
│  the jurymen are back in their proper places--\\nALL,' he repeated with     │
│  great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as\\nhe said do.\\n\\nAlice looked   │
│  at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she\\nhad put the Lizard in   │
│  head downwards, and the poor little thing\\nwas waving its tail about in   │
│  a melancholy way, being quite unable\\nto move. She soon got it out        │
│  again, and put it right; `not that\\nit signifies much,' she said to       │
│  herself; `I should think it\\nwould be QUITE as much use in the trial one  │
│  way up as the other.'\\n\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered      │
│  from the shock of\\nbeing upset, and their slates and pencils had been     │
│  found and\\nhanded back to them, they set to work very diligently to       │
│  write\\nout a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who          │
│  seemed\\ntoo much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth           │
│  open,\\ngazing up into the roof of the court.\\n\\n`What do you know       │
│  about this business?' the King said to\\nAlice.\\n\\n`Nothing,' said       │
│  Alice.\\n\\n`Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.\\n\\n`Nothing          │
│  whatever,' said Alice.\\n\\n`That's very important,' the King said,        │
│  turning to the jury.\\nThey were just beginning to write this down on      │
│  their slates, when\\nthe White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your      │
│  Majesty means,\\nof course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but        │
│  frowning and\\nmaking faces at him as he spoke.\\n\\n`UNimportant, of      │
│  course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and\\nwent on to himself in an    │
│  undertone, `important--unimportant--\\nunimportant--important--' as if he  │
│  were trying which word\\nsounded best.\\n\\nSome of the jury wrote it      │
│  down `important,' and some\\n`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she   │
│  was near enough to\\nlook over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a      │
│  bit,' she\\nthought to herself.\\n\\nAt this moment the King, who had      │
│  been for some time busily\\nwriting in his note-book, cackled out          │
│  `Silence!' and read out\\nfrom his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS      │
│  MORE THAN A MILE\\nHIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'\\n\\nEverybody looked at      │
│  Alice.\\n\\n`I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.\\n\\n`You are,' said the    │
│  King.\\n\\n`Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.\\n\\n`Well, I shan't  │
│  go, at any rate,' said Alice: `\"}"                                        │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │

│  The previous `search_files_content` action failed because the query was    │
│  too long and likely contained formatting differences (e.g., extra          │
│  newlines or spaces) that prevented an exact match. I should have used a    │

│    `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,             │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │

The previous `search_files_content` action failed because the query was too long and likely contained formatting differences (e.g., extra newlines or spaces) that prevented an exact match. I should have used a shorter, more robust query.

However, I have now read the entire `alice29.txt` file. I can manually locate the prefix within the file content and extract the continuation.

The prefix ends with:
`Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: ` `

Looking at the full content of `alice29.txt`, the exact continuation is:
`besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'`

I will now extract the next 100-200 words from this point.

The prefix ends with:
`Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: ` `

The continuation in the file is:
`besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'

  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.

  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.

  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.
`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling
voice.

  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has
just been picked up.'

  `What's in it?' said the Queen.

  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems

  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was
written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
