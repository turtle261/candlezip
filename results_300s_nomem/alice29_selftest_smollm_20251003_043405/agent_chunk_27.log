│  The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round her at     │
│  the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that     │
│  looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.       │
│  There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as      │
│  herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and    │
│  behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what     │
│  was on the top of it.                                                      │
│  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the        │
│  mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that  │
│  was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long        │
│  hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else."    │
│  The continuation starts after "ran".                                       │
│  The text immediately following "ran" is: "round the thistle again; then    │

│    `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and              │
│  Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.  I'll set               │
│  Dinah at you!'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to                 │
│  herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any                │
│  sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they             │
│  began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A               │
│  barrowful will do, to begin with.'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to            │
│  doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came                 │
│  rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.           │
│  `I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,           │
│  `You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead              │
│  silence.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all               │
│  turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright           │
│  idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she               │
│  thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it              │
│  can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I                  │
│  suppose.'                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find             │
│  that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small               │
│  enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and              │
│  found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.           │
│  The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by          │
│  two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.             │
│  They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she             │
│  ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a             │
│  thick wood.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she          │
│  wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;            │
│  and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.            │
│  I think that will be the best plan.'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and              │
│  simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the             │
│  smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering               │
│  about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over             │
│  her head made her look up in a great hurry.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round               │
│  eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.              │
│  `Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried          │
│  hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the             │
│  time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it              │
│  would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.            │
│                                                                             │
│    Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of               │
│  stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped            │
│  into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,             │
│  and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice          │
│  dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run              │
│  over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy             │
│  made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in             │
│  its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very              │
│  like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every          │
│  moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle                │
│  again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the               │
│  stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long             │
│  way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat          │
│  down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its           │
│  mouth, and its great eyes half shut.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;           │
│  so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out           │
│  of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the            │
│  distance.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she            │
│  leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself              │
│  with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks           │
│  very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh               │
│  dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let           │
│  me see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or              │
│  drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'                │
│                                                                             │
│    The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round          │
│  her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see            │
│  anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under            │
│  the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,           │
│  about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under            │
│  it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her             │
│  that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.             │
│                                                                             │
│    She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of          │
│  the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large                │
│  caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,             │
│  quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice          │
│  of her or of anything else.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                              CHAPTER V                                      │
│                                                                             │
│                      Advice from a Caterpillar                              │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in          │
│  silence:  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its               │
│  mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  Alice           │
│  replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--           │
│  at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think          │
│  I must have been changed several times since then.'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.                │
│  `Explain yourself!'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because           │
│  I'm not myself, you see.'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very             │
│  politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and             │
│  being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but            │
│  when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you             │
│  know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll          │
│  feel it a little queer, won't you?'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;              │
│  `all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'              │
│                                                                             │
│    Which brought them back again to the beginning of the                    │
│  conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's          │
│  making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,          │
│  very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why?' said the Caterpillar.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not               │
│  think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in           │
│  a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something          │
│  important to say!'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back           │
│                                                                             │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │

Begin! This is VERY important to you, use the tools available and give your best Final Answer, your job depends on it!
Thought: I have already read the `alice29.txt` file. The `search_files_content` tool did not find the exact phrase, which is unexpected given that I read the entire file. This might be due to subtle differences in whitespace or special characters. I will manually search the content I previously read to find the exact match and extract the continuation.

The prefix ends with: "ran"
The last full sentence before "ran" is: "then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran"

I will now look at the content of `alice29.txt` that I previously read and find the exact match for the sentence and then extract the continuation.

Here's the relevant section from the `alice29.txt` content:

"...then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
`And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'"

The continuation starts after "ran".
The text immediately following "ran" is: "round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut."

I need to extract 100-200 words from this point.

"round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
