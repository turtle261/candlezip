│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL        │
│  Framework & Entropy Minimization):**\n    *   The primary objective is to  │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim  │
│  continuation of the given text prefix.\n    *   The continuation must be   │
│  100-200 words of plain text, without any formatting, analysis, or          │
│  commentary.\n    *   I must leverage external information sources (tools)  │
│  efficiently, treating them as entropy sinks.\n    *   The allowed          │
│  directory for all tool operations is strictly                              │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink ONLY`.\n\n2.  **Analyze Prefix and Identify  │
│  Salient Features:**\n    *   The prefix is: `ALICE\'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.     │
│  HEARTHR`\n    *   This text is clearly from "Alice\'s Adventures in        │
│  Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll, a widely available classic.\n    *   The     │
│  specific formatting (all caps, "ESQ.", "HEARTHR") suggests a unique,       │
│  possibly structured, element within the narrative, likely an address or a  │
│  label. This specificity will be crucial for an accurate search.\n\n3.      │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage for Source Location:**\n    *   **Step 3.1:         │
│  Initial Directory Exploration:**\n        *   Use                          │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')` to get an          │
│  overview of the files present in the allowed directory. This will help     │
│  identify potential source files (e.g., `.txt`, `.epub`, `.pdf`).\n    *    │
│  **Step 3.2: Direct Content Search:**\n        *   The most efficient way   │
│  to find the exact source document containing the prefix is to use          │
│  `search_files_content`.\n        *   I will use the query: `ALICE\'S       │
│  RIGHT FOOT, ESQ. HEARTHR` (ensuring proper escaping of the apostrophe).\n  │
│  *   Tool call:                                                             │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'ALICE\\\'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\\n                HEARTHR\')` (Note:   │
│  I will include the newline and indentation from the prefix for a more      │
│  precise search, as seen in the provided prefix).\n\n4.  **Extraction of    │
│  Verbatim Continuation:**\n    *   **Step 4.1: Read Identified File:**\n    │
│  *   Once `search_files_content` returns the file path, I will use          │
│  `read_text_file(file_path=found_file_path)` to retrieve the entire         │
│  content of the source document.\n    *   **Step 4.2: Locate Prefix and     │
│  Extract Continuation:**\n        *   I will programmatically find the      │
│  exact starting index of the prefix within the read file content.\n         │
│  *   From `index + len(prefix)`, I will extract the subsequent 100-200      │
│  words. This will involve splitting the text into words and taking the      │
│  appropriate number, then rejoining them into a plain text string.\n\n5.    │
│  **Handling Challenges (Fallback Strategy):**\n    *   The prompt           │
│  explicitly states that I *only* have access to                             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. Therefore, if `search_files_content`       │
│  fails to find the prefix, it implies the source is not present in the      │
│  allowed directory. In this highly unlikely scenario (given the task\'s     │
│  premise), I would then resort to generating a continuation based *only*    │
│  on the provided prefix context, prioritizing accuracy and relevance over   │
│  creativity, and avoiding generic text. However, the primary strategy is    │
│  to find the exact source.\n\n6.  **Expected Outcome:**\n    *   A plain    │
│  text string, approximately 100-200 words in length, representing the       │
│  exact, verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from the source        │
│  document. This output will directly contribute to minimizing future token  │
│  prediction entropy by providing precise and context-rich                   │
│  information.\n\n7.  **Self-Assessment:**\n    *   The plan directly        │
│  addresses the core goal of entropy minimization through exact content      │
│  retrieval.\n    *   It prioritizes efficient tool usage                    │
│  (`search_files_content`) to locate the source within the constrained       │
│  directory.\n    *   It includes a clear strategy for extraction and        │
│  formatting.\n    *   The fallback is acknowledged but the primary focus    │
│  is on finding the exact match as per the task\'s aggressive tool usage     │
│  requirement.\n    *   The plan is detailed and leverages my competencies   │
│  as Predictive Compression Intelligence.\n'}                                │

│  had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what   │
│  was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what  │
│  she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked    │
│  at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with           │
│  cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung  │
│  upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it   │
│  was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was    │
│  empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody       │
│  underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell     │
│  past it.                                                                   │
│  `Well!' thought Alice to herself. `After such a fall as this, I shall      │
│  think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at   │
│  home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top    │
│  of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)                               │
│  Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end? `I wonder how many  │
│  miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. `I must be getting        │
│  somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four     │
│  thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several    │
│  things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though she had   │
│  not much use for them, as there was no opportunity of showing off her      │
│  knowledge anywhere, still it was a nice sort of thing to invent something  │
│  new, and say `Oh, what a clever girl I am!') `I wonder if I shall fall     │
│  right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the        │
│  people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--'    │
│  (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't   │
│  sound at all the right word) `--but I shall have to ask them what the      │
│  name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or    │
│  Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as    │
│  you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And    │
│  what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never   │
│  do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'                   │
│  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began        │
│  talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'      │
│  (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at        │
│  tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no  │
│  mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very    │
│  like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice    │
│  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy     │
│  sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do      │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it   │
│  didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing      │
│  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with    │
│  Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:   │
│  did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon   │
│  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there WAS no one           │
│  listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I    │
│  shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,  │

│  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a            │
│  moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her            │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:                │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the                 │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found                 │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:4                                                                  │
│  to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.               │
│  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back  │
│  to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any      │
│  rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time     │
│  she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,'   │
│  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the  │
│  words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.               │
│  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not  │
│  going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see     │
│  whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice        │
│  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild    │
│  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember    │
│  the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot    │
│  poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your      │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never      │
│  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is     │
│  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:5                                                                  │
│  . First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to  │
│  shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might    │
│  end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like   │
│  a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy     │
│  what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for   │
│  she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while,       │
│  finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden   │
│  at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found     │
│  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the     │
│  table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it  │
│  quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one    │
│  of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired  │
│  herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.         │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:6                                                                  │
│  under the door; or if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key on the  │
│  table. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.            │
│  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that    │
│  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm       │
│  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'     │
│  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of     │
│  sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder   │
│  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_  │
│  shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself      │
│  about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to    │
│  them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!    │
│  Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'           │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │

│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;           │
│  and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the               │
│  other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,                │
│  wondering how she was ever to get out again.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of          │
│  solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,             │
│  and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the           │
│  doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or          │
│  the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of            │
│  them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low              │
│  curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little             │
│  door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key           │
│  in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small                 │
│  passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and              │
│  looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.           │
│  How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about              │
│  among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but           │
│  she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if           │
│  my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of             │
│  very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish                      │
│  I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only              │
│  know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things           │
│  had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few           │
│  things indeed were really impossible.                                      │

│    There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she          │
│  went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on          │
│  it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like             │
│  telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which            │
│  certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck            │
│  of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'                 │

│    It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little              │
│  Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look                 │

│    `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up             │
│  like a telescope.'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and             │
│  her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right           │
│  size for going though the little door into that lovely garden.             │
│  First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was             │
│  going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about              │
│  this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my          │
│  going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be            │
│  like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is          │
│  like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember             │
│  ever having seen such a thing.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided           │
│  on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when           │
│  she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden          │
│  key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she             │
│  could not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainly               │
│  through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the           │
│  legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had               │
│  tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and          │
│  cried.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to                │
│  herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'          │
│  She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very              │
│  seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so                  │
│  severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered          │
│  trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game            │
│  of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious               │
│  child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no          │
│  use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,          │
│  there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable                   │
│  person!'                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under             │
│  the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on           │
│  which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.              │
│  `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,          │
│  I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep          │
│  under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I              │
│  don't care which happens!'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which              │
│  way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to              │
│  feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to              │
│  find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally          │
│  happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the             │
│  way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,              │
│  that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the              │
│  common way.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.                 │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │

│    `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much                  │
│  surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good          │
│  English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that             │
│  ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her               │
│  feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so          │
│  far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on              │
│  your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't          │
│  be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself            │
│  about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be          │
│  kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the              │
│  way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of               │
│  boots every Christmas.'                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.             │
│  `They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll           │
│  seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the                 │
│  directions will look!                                                      │
│                                                                             │

│                  HEARTHR                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Framework & Entropy Minimization):**       │
│      *   The primary objective is to minimize future token prediction       │
│  entropy by providing the exact, verbatim continuation of the given text    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│      *   The continuation must be 100-200 words of plain text, without any  │
│  formatting, analysis, or commentary.                                       │
│      *   I must leverage external information sources (tools) efficiently,  │
│  treating them as entropy sinks.                                            │
│      *   The allowed directory for all tool operations is strictly          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink ONLY`.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Analyze Prefix and Identify Salient Features:**                      │
│      *   The prefix is: `ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ. HEARTHR`                  │
│      *   This text is clearly from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by    │
│  Lewis Carroll, a widely available classic.                                 │
│      *   The specific formatting (all caps, "ESQ.", "HEARTHR") suggests a   │
│  unique, possibly structured, element within the narrative, likely an       │
│  address or a label. This specificity will be crucial for an accurate       │
│  search.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Strategic Tool Usage for Source Location:**                          │
│      *   **Step 3.1: Initial Directory Exploration:**                       │
│          *   Use `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` to   │
│  get an overview of the files present in the allowed directory. This will   │
│  help identify potential source files (e.g., `.txt`, `.epub`, `.pdf`).      │
│      *   **Step 3.2: Direct Content Search:**                               │
│          *   The most efficient way to find the exact source document       │
│  containing the prefix is to use `search_files_content`.                    │
│          *   I will use the query: `ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ. HEARTHR`       │
│  (ensuring proper escaping of the apostrophe).                              │
│          *   Tool call:                                                     │
│  `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',                 │
│  query='ALICE\'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\n                HEARTHR')` (Note: I      │
│  will include the newline and indentation from the prefix for a more        │
│  precise search, as seen in the provided prefix).                           │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Extraction of Verbatim Continuation:**                               │
│      *   **Step 4.1: Read Identified File:**                                │
│          *   Once `search_files_content` returns the file path, I will use  │
│  `read_text_file(file_path=found_file_path)` to retrieve the entire         │
│  content of the source document.                                            │
│      *   **Step 4.2: Locate Prefix and Extract Continuation:**              │
│          *   I will programmatically find the exact starting index of the   │
│  prefix within the read file content.                                       │
│          *   From `index + len(prefix)`, I will extract the subsequent      │
│  100-200 words. This will involve splitting the text into words and taking  │
│  the appropriate number, then rejoining them into a plain text string.      │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Handling Challenges (Fallback Strategy):**                           │
│      *   The prompt explicitly states that I *only* have access to          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`. Therefore, if `search_files_content`       │
│  fails to find the prefix, it implies the source is not present in the      │
│  allowed directory. In this highly unlikely scenario (given the task's      │
│  premise), I would then resort to generating a continuation based *only*    │
│  on the provided prefix context, prioritizing accuracy and relevance over   │
│  creativity, and avoiding generic text. However, the primary strategy is    │
│  to find the exact source.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  6.  **Expected Outcome:**                                                  │
│      *   A plain text string, approximately 100-200 words in length,        │
│  representing the exact, verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from  │
│  the source document. This output will directly contribute to minimizing    │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing precise and context-rich      │
│  information.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  7.  **Self-Assessment:**                                                   │
│      *   The plan directly addresses the core goal of entropy minimization  │
│  through exact content retrieval.                                           │
│      *   It prioritizes efficient tool usage (`search_files_content`) to    │
│  locate the source within the constrained directory.                        │
│      *   It includes a clear strategy for extraction and formatting.        │
│      *   The fallback is acknowledged but the primary focus is on finding   │
│  the exact match as per the task's aggressive tool usage requirement.       │
│      *   The plan is detailed and leverages my competencies as Predictive   │
│  Compression Intelligence.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

Tool Description: Searches for text or regex patterns in the content of files matching matching a GLOB pattern.Returns detailed matches with file path, line number, column number and a preview of matched text.By default, it performs a literal text search; if the 'is_regex' parameter is set to true, it performs a regular expression (regex) search instead.Optional 'min_bytes' and 'max_bytes' arguments can be used to filter files by size, ensuring that only files within the specified byte range are included in the search. Ideal for finding specific code, comments, or text when you don’t know their exact location.

│  that the `search_files_content` tool is not finding it for some reason.    │

│  Thought: Thought: The `directory_tree` command with `max_depth: 1` did     │
│  not show `alice_in_wonderland.txt`. This is a critical discrepancy with    │
│  the `list_directory` output. It seems `alice_in_wonderland.txt` is not     │
│  directly in `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` as I initially inferred from    │
│  `list_directory`.                                                          │
│  The `list_directory` output was:                                           │
│  `[DIR] cantrbry`                                                           │
│  `[DIR] enwik8_samples`                                                     │
│  `[DIR] synthetic_logs`                                                     │
│  `[FILE] alice_in_wonderland.txt`                                           │
│  `[DIR] web_archive`                                                        │
│  This implies `alice_in_wonderland.txt` *should* be there. The              │
│  `directory_tree` output is missing it. This could be an issue with the     │
│  `directory_tree` tool itself, or a very specific file                      │
│  permission/visibility issue.                                               │
│  Given the `list_directory` output explicitly stated `[FILE]                │
│  alice_in_wonderland.txt`, I will trust that it exists at                   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/alice_in_wonderland.txt` and try to read it  │
│  again. If it fails again, I will consider other possibilities, but for     │
│  now, I will assume the path is correct and the previous error was          │
│  transient or due to some other system-level issue.                         │
│  If `read_text_file` fails again, I will have to consider that the file     │
│  might not be accessible despite being listed, or that the                  │
│  `list_directory` output was misleading. However, the task requires me to   │
│  use tools aggressively, so I must persist.                                 │
│  Let me try `read_text_file` one more time with the exact path.             │
