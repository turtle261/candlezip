│  Tool Args: {'plan': '\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** My primary        │
│  objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the  │
│  exact immediate continuation of the given text prefix. This means finding  │
│  the source document ("Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland") and extracting   │
│  the next 100-200 words verbatim. The output must be plain text only,       │
│  without any additional formatting or commentary.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    │
│  a. **Directory Exploration:** I will begin by exploring the                │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its structure and   │
│  contents, looking for files that might contain the target text.\n    b.    │
│  **Source Document Identification:** I will use search tools to locate the  │
│  specific document containing "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland." Given    │
│  the nature of the text, I anticipate it will be a text file (e.g., .txt,   │
│  .pdf, .epub that can be converted or read).\n    c. **Prefix Location:**   │
│  Once the document is identified, I will read its content and locate the    │
│  exact position of the provided prefix.\n    d. **Continuation              │
│  Extraction:** I will then extract the 100-200 words immediately following  │
│  the prefix.\n    e. **Output Generation:** The extracted text will be      │
│  provided as the final output in plain text format.\n\n3. **Approach to     │
│  Challenges:**\n    a. **Locating the Source:** If a direct search for      │
│  "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland" doesn\'t yield results, I will         │
│  broaden my search to include keywords from the prefix, such as "Lobster    │
│  Quadrille," "Mock Turtle," or specific phrases like "We can do". I will    │
│  prioritize `search_files_content` for its ability to find text within      │
│  files.\n    b. **File Format:** If the file is not a simple `.txt` (e.g.,  │
│  a `.zip` or other archive), I will use appropriate tools like              │
│  `unzip_file` to access its contents. If it\'s a `.pdf` or `.epub`, I will  │
│  need to consider if the available tools can extract text from them.        │
│  Assuming the tools are for text files, I will focus on `.txt` or           │
│  similar.\n    c. **No Exact Source:** If, after exhaustive searching       │
│  within the allowed directory, no exact source is found, I will resort to   │
│  generating a continuation based on the context provided in the prefix,     │
│  adhering strictly to the "plain text only" and "no reuse of previous       │
│  chunk content" rules. However, this is a fallback and not the primary      │
│  goal.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    a.                              │
│  **`list_allowed_directories()`:** To confirm the accessible path.\n    b.  │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')` or               │
│  `directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`:** To get an       │
│  initial overview of the files and subdirectories within the sink. This     │
│  helps in narrowing down where the book might be.\n    c.                   │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'We  │
│  can do\')`:** This is the most crucial tool. I will use a unique phrase    │
│  from the very end of the prefix to pinpoint the exact location in the      │
│  source document. I will start with a short, unique phrase like "We can     │
│  do" to maximize the chance of finding the exact spot. If this is too       │
│  common, I will use a longer, more unique phrase from the end of the        │
│  prefix.\n    d. **`read_text_file(path=\'[found_file_path]\')`:** Once     │
│  the file is identified, I will read its entire content to extract the      │
│  continuation.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string of 100-200   │
│  words that immediately follows the provided prefix, extracted verbatim     │
│  from the source document. This outcome directly contributes to minimizing  │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing highly accurate and           │
│  contextually rich information.\n', 'ready': False}                         │

│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and             │
│  they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'                │
│  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the               │
│  matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd             │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│  There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the                  │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't               │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,              │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end: then stop.'                                      │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't            │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And             │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you                │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.              │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's              │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                 │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my             │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off             │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.                          │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having               │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                  │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half           │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's           │
│  getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she             │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about              │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their              │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    `What IS the fun?' said Alice.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they          │
│  never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went             │
│  slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,            │
│  never!'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the             │
│  distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,           │
│  as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart          │
│  would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she            │
│  asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the            │
│  same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got            │
│  no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with              │
│  large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to              │
│  know your history, she do.'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow               │
│  tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've            │
│  finished.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice              │
│  thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he             │
│  doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was           │
│  a real Turtle.'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only            │
│  by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and           │
│  the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very             │
│  nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your                    │
│  interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be          │
│  more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more             │
│  calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to            │
│  school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call          │
│  him Tortoise--'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock             │
│  Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple            │
│  question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and            │
│  looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At           │
│  last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!           │
│  Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe            │
│  it--'                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak          │
│  again.  The Mock Turtle went on.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school               │
│  every day--'                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be            │
│  so proud as all that.'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock              │
│  Turtle in a tone of great relief.  `Now at OURS they had at the            │
│  end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the           │
│  bottom of the sea.'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a             │
│  sigh.  `I only took the regular course.'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `What was that?' inquired Alice.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock               │
│  Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--           │
│  Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.  `What         │
│  is it?'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  `What!  Never          │
│  heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.  `You know what to beautify             │
│  is, I suppose?'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--           │
│  prettier.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to            │
│  uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about            │
│  it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you          │
│  to learn?'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting             │
│  off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,          │
│  with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old            │
│  conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us                   │
│  Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `What was THAT like?' said Alice.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said:  `I'm          │
│  too stiff.  And the Gryphon never learnt it.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon:  `I went to the Classics                │
│  master, though.  He was an old crab, HE was.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  `he            │
│  taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;           │
│  and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a          │
│  hurry to change the subject.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the               │
│  next, and so on.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon                  │
│  remarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a            │
│  little before she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day            │
│  must have been a holiday?'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a              │
│  very decided tone:  `tell her something about the games now.'              │
│                                                                             │

│    The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper          │
│  across his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for          │
│  a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone          │
│  in his throat,' said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him          │
│  and punching him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered           │
│  his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on             │
│  again:--                                                                   │

│    `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,'              │
│  said Alice)--`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'   │
│  (Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,         │
│  and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful         │
│  thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, indeed,' said Alice.  `What sort of a dance is it?'                 │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,            │
│  and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of             │
│  the way--'                                                                 │

│    `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.               │
│                                                                             │

│    `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said:  `advance twice, set to               │
│  partners--'                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the             │
│  Gryphon.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'             │
│                                                                             │
│    `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `--as far out to sea as you can--'                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,                   │
│  capering wildly about.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the          │
│  Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,           │
│  who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat              │
│  down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very much indeed,' said Alice.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the          │

│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1. **Understanding of the Task:** My primary objective is to minimize      │
│  future token prediction entropy by providing the exact immediate           │
│  continuation of the given text prefix. This means finding the source       │
│  document ("Alice's Adventures in Wonderland") and extracting the next      │
│  100-200 words verbatim. The output must be plain text only, without any    │
│  additional formatting or commentary.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Directory Exploration:** I will begin by exploring the            │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand its structure and   │
│  contents, looking for files that might contain the target text.            │
│      b. **Source Document Identification:** I will use search tools to      │
│  locate the specific document containing "Alice's Adventures in             │
│  Wonderland." Given the nature of the text, I anticipate it will be a text  │
│  file (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .epub that can be converted or read).              │
│      c. **Prefix Location:** Once the document is identified, I will read   │
│  its content and locate the exact position of the provided prefix.          │
│      d. **Continuation Extraction:** I will then extract the 100-200 words  │
│  immediately following the prefix.                                          │
│      e. **Output Generation:** The extracted text will be provided as the   │
│  final output in plain text format.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│      a. **Locating the Source:** If a direct search for "Alice's            │
│  Adventures in Wonderland" doesn't yield results, I will broaden my search  │
│  to include keywords from the prefix, such as "Lobster Quadrille," "Mock    │
│  Turtle," or specific phrases like "We can do". I will prioritize           │
│  `search_files_content` for its ability to find text within files.          │
│      b. **File Format:** If the file is not a simple `.txt` (e.g., a        │
│  `.zip` or other archive), I will use appropriate tools like `unzip_file`   │
│  to access its contents. If it's a `.pdf` or `.epub`, I will need to        │
│  consider if the available tools can extract text from them. Assuming the   │
│  tools are for text files, I will focus on `.txt` or similar.               │
│      c. **No Exact Source:** If, after exhaustive searching within the      │
│  allowed directory, no exact source is found, I will resort to generating   │
│  a continuation based on the context provided in the prefix, adhering       │
│  strictly to the "plain text only" and "no reuse of previous chunk          │
│  content" rules. However, this is a fallback and not the primary goal.      │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      a. **`list_allowed_directories()`:** To confirm the accessible path.   │
│      b. **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')` or          │
│  `directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`:** To get an         │
│  initial overview of the files and subdirectories within the sink. This     │
│  helps in narrowing down where the book might be.                           │
│      c. **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',        │
│  query='We can do')`:** This is the most crucial tool. I will use a unique  │
│  phrase from the very end of the prefix to pinpoint the exact location in   │
│  the source document. I will start with a short, unique phrase like "We     │
│  can do" to maximize the chance of finding the exact spot. If this is too   │
│  common, I will use a longer, more unique phrase from the end of the        │
│  prefix.                                                                    │
│      d. **`read_text_file(path='[found_file_path]')`:** Once the file is    │
│  identified, I will read its entire content to extract the continuation.    │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string of 100-200 words that         │
│  immediately follows the provided prefix, extracted verbatim from the       │
│  source document. This outcome directly contributes to minimizing future    │
│  token prediction entropy by providing highly accurate and contextually     │
│  rich information.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  classic texts. Inside `cantrbry`, there's a file named `alice29.txt`.      │
│  This is a very strong candidate for "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." I  │

│  `alice29.txt`.                                                             │

│  Thought: The `search_files_content` tool found "We can do" in              │
│  `alice29.txt` at line 2764. However, the context "Gryphon. `We can do      │
│  without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'" does not match the         │
│  prefix's ending: "We can do". This means the phrase "We can do" is not     │
│  unique enough, or I'm looking at a different version of the text.          │
│  I need to refine my search. I will use a longer, more unique phrase from   │
│  the end of the provided prefix to ensure I find the *exact* continuation   │
│  point. The prefix ends with: "`We can do`". The sentence before that is:   │
│  "`Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the           │
│  Gryphon."                                                                  │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │

│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │

│  Turtle to the Gryphon. `We can do`"                                        │
