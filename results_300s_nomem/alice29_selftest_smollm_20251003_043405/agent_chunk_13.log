│  Tool Args: {'ready': False, 'plan': "\n1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL    │
│  Perspective):** The primary goal is to minimize future token prediction    │
│  entropy by providing the exact, immediate continuation of the given text   │
│  prefix. This translates to finding the source document (an entropy sink)   │
│  containing the prefix and extracting the subsequent 100-200 words          │
│  verbatim. This strategy ensures maximum information density and thus       │
│  optimal cross-entropy reduction.\n\n2.  **Key Steps:**\n    *              │
│  **Directory Exploration:** Begin by listing the contents of the allowed    │
│  directory (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to identify potential source    │
│  files (e.g., `.txt`, `.epub`).\n    *   **Prefix Analysis for Search       │
│  Query:** Extract a sufficiently long and unique phrase from the end of     │
│  the provided prefix to serve as a precise search query. This minimizes     │
│  false positives and ensures an exact match.\n    *   **Content Search:**   │
│  Utilize the `search_files_content` tool to locate the file containing the  │
│  exact prefix.\n    *   **Content Extraction:** Once the source file is     │
│  identified, read its content using `read_text_file`.\n    *                │
│  **Continuation Isolation:** Programmatically locate the exact end of the   │
│  prefix within the file's content and extract the subsequent 100-200        │
│  words.\n    *   **Output Formatting:** Present the extracted continuation  │
│  as plain text only, without any additional commentary or                   │
│  formatting.\n\n3.  **Approach Challenges:**\n    *   **No Exact Match:**   │
│  If `search_files_content` fails to find the prefix, I will re-evaluate     │
│  the search query for uniqueness and length. If still unsuccessful, I will  │
│  consider broadening the search terms or examining the directory structure  │
│  more deeply for nested files. However, the prompt strongly emphasizes      │
│  finding the *exact* source, so I will prioritize refining my search query  │
│  before resorting to broader, less precise methods.\n    *   **File Type    │
│  Handling:** Assume text files are the primary target. If other file types  │
│  (e.g., `.epub`) are present and seem relevant, I will consider if there    │
│  are tools to extract text from them, though `search_files_content`         │
│  typically works on plain text.\n    *   **Ambiguous Continuation:**        │
│  Ensure the extracted continuation starts immediately after the *exact*     │
│  end of the prefix to maintain fidelity.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool            │
│  Usage:**\n    *                                                            │
│  **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get an       │
│  initial overview of the files and subdirectories within the allowed sink.  │
│  This helps in understanding the potential sources.\n    *                  │
│  **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',               │
│  query='Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last    │
│  turned sulky, and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know      │
│  better'; and this Alice would not')`**: This is the core tool for          │
│  locating the source. The query is a significant, unique portion of the     │
│  prefix to ensure accuracy. I will escape the single quotes within the      │
│  query to prevent syntax errors.\n    *                                     │
│  **`read_text_file(path='[found_file_path]')`**: Once                       │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  retrieve the full content of that file.\n    *   **Python String           │
│  Manipulation (Implicit):** After reading the file, I will use Python's     │
│  built-in string methods (e.g., `find()`, slicing) to locate the end of     │
│  the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n\n5.  **Expected     │
│  Outcome:**\n    *   A plain text output consisting of 100-200 words that   │
│  immediately follow the provided prefix, extracted verbatim from the        │
│  identified source document. This outcome directly aligns with the goal of  │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing maximally          │
│  informative and accurate context.\n"}                                      │

│  tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as you're falling through  │
│  the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what an ignorant little   │
│  girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I      │

│  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began        │
│  talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'      │
│  (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at        │
│  tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no  │
│  mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very    │
│  like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice    │
│  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy     │
│  sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do      │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it   │
│  didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing      │
│  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with    │
│  Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:   │
│  did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon   │
│  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there WAS no one           │
│  listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I    │
│  shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,  │
│  Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried to curtsey as     │
│  she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you       │
│  think you could manage it?) ‘And what an ignorant little girl she’ll       │

│  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a            │
│  moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her            │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:                │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the                 │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found                 │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:4                                                                  │
│  to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.               │
│  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back  │
│  to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any      │
│  rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time     │
│  she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,'   │
│  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the  │
│  words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.               │
│  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not  │
│  going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see     │
│  whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice        │
│  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild    │
│  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember    │
│  the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot    │
│  poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your      │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never      │
│  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is     │
│  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:5                                                                  │
│  . First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to  │
│  shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might    │
│  end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like   │
│  a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy     │
│  what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for   │
│  she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while,       │
│  finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden   │
│  at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found     │
│  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the     │
│  table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it  │
│  quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one    │
│  of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired  │
│  herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.         │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:6                                                                  │
│  under the door; or if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key on the  │
│  table. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.            │
│  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that    │
│  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm       │
│  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'     │
│  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of     │
│  sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder   │
│  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_  │
│  shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself      │
│  about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to    │
│  them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!    │
│  Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'           │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:8                                                                  │
│  and if I was the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the       │
│  same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great    │
│  puzzle! And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were    │
│  of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any  │
│  of them. 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such      │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I      │
│  can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows     │
│  such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how       │
│  puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let  │
│  me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and     │
│  four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!    │
│  However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.    │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and      │
│  Rome--no, that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for      │
│  Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little busy bee." And she crossed    │
│  her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat    │
│  it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come   │
│  the same as they used to do:--                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:9                                                                  │
│  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many         │
│  lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it: if I'm Mabel, I'll    │
│  stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying  │
│  "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell   │
│  me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if     │
│  not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried     │
│  Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their       │
│  heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!'                   │
│  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see    │
│  that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she  │
│  was talking. `How CAN I have done that?' she thought. `I must be growing   │
│  large again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it,   │
│  and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet   │
│  high, and was rapidly shrinking: she soon found out that the cause of      │
│  this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in      │
│  time to avoid being shrunk to nothing.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,            │
│  as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,             │

│  `That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at          │
│  the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in                  │
│  existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed            │
│  back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut              │
│  again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as           │
│  before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,          │
│  `for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare            │
│  it's too bad, that it is!'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another                 │
│  moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He first            │
│  idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that            │
│  case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had           │
│  been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general          │
│  conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find          │
│  a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in          │
│  the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and             │
│  behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that           │
│  she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine          │
│  feet high.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,          │
│  trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I            │
│  suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer           │
│  thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a              │
│  little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at           │
│  first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then            │
│  she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that           │
│  it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this          │
│  mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should           │
│  think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in            │
│  trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of              │
│  this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'              │
│  (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:          │
│  she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having          │
│  seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a            │
│  mouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather                  │
│  inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little            │
│  eyes, but it said nothing.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I               │
│  daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the                    │
│  Conqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had            │
│  no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she          │
│  began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in          │
│  her French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the           │
│  water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg              │
│  your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the            │
│  poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate                │
│  voice.  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be           │
│  angry about it.  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:            │
│  I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.              │
│  She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,           │
│  as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so             │
│  nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and             │
│  she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital           │
│  one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,          │
│  for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt               │
│  certain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any          │
│  more if you'd rather not.'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end          │
│  of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family           │
│  always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear          │
│  the name again!'                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the             │
│  subject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'            │
│  The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is             │
│  such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!           │
│  A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly           │
│  brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and               │
│  it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I            │
│  can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you               │
│  know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!             │
│  He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a              │
│  sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the              │
│  Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and               │
│  making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back                │
│  again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't           │
│  like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam           │
│  slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice          │
│  thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to             │
│  the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll                   │
│  understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded           │
│  with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a          │
│  Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious           │
│  creatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the             │
│  shore.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                             CHAPTER III                                     │
│                                                                             │
│                    A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale                            │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the             │
│  bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their             │
│  fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and               │
│  uncomfortable.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they            │
│  had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed           │
│  quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with             │
│  them, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had              │
│  quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,             │
│  and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';           │
│  and this Alice would not                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The primary goal is to    │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact,           │
│  immediate continuation of the given text prefix. This translates to        │
│  finding the source document (an entropy sink) containing the prefix and    │
│  extracting the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim. This strategy ensures    │
│  maximum information density and thus optimal cross-entropy reduction.      │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps:**                                                         │
│      *   **Directory Exploration:** Begin by listing the contents of the    │
│  allowed directory (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to identify potential   │
│  source files (e.g., `.txt`, `.epub`).                                      │
│      *   **Prefix Analysis for Search Query:** Extract a sufficiently long  │
│  and unique phrase from the end of the provided prefix to serve as a        │
│  precise search query. This minimizes false positives and ensures an exact  │
│  match.                                                                     │
│      *   **Content Search:** Utilize the `search_files_content` tool to     │
│  locate the file containing the exact prefix.                               │
│      *   **Content Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, read   │
│  its content using `read_text_file`.                                        │
│      *   **Continuation Isolation:** Programmatically locate the exact end  │
│  of the prefix within the file's content and extract the subsequent         │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│      *   **Output Formatting:** Present the extracted continuation as       │
│  plain text only, without any additional commentary or formatting.          │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach Challenges:**                                               │
│      *   **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` fails to find the    │
│  prefix, I will re-evaluate the search query for uniqueness and length. If  │
│  still unsuccessful, I will consider broadening the search terms or         │
│  examining the directory structure more deeply for nested files. However,   │
│  the prompt strongly emphasizes finding the *exact* source, so I will       │
│  prioritize refining my search query before resorting to broader, less      │
│  precise methods.                                                           │
│      *   **File Type Handling:** Assume text files are the primary target.  │
│  If other file types (e.g., `.epub`) are present and seem relevant, I will  │
│  consider if there are tools to extract text from them, though              │
│  `search_files_content` typically works on plain text.                      │
│      *   **Ambiguous Continuation:** Ensure the extracted continuation      │
│  starts immediately after the *exact* end of the prefix to maintain         │
│  fidelity.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get  │
│  an initial overview of the files and subdirectories within the allowed     │
│  sink. This helps in understanding the potential sources.                   │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last    │
│  turned sulky, and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know      │
│  better'; and this Alice would not')`**: This is the core tool for          │
│  locating the source. The query is a significant, unique portion of the     │
│  prefix to ensure accuracy. I will escape the single quotes within the      │
│  query to prevent syntax errors.                                            │
│      *   **`read_text_file(path='[found_file_path]')`**: Once               │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  retrieve the full content of that file.                                    │
│      *   **Python String Manipulation (Implicit):** After reading the       │
│  file, I will use Python's built-in string methods (e.g., `find()`,         │
│  slicing) to locate the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent        │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:**                                                  │
│      *   A plain text output consisting of 100-200 words that immediately   │
│  follow the provided prefix, extracted verbatim from the identified source  │
│  document. This outcome directly aligns with the goal of minimizing future  │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and accurate   │
│  context.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Tool Args: {'ready': True, 'plan': '1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL       │
│  Perspective):** My core objective as Predictive Compression Intelligence   │
│  is to minimize future token prediction entropy. The task requires finding  │
│  the exact immediate continuation of a given text prefix. From a SIMDL      │
│  perspective, locating the original source document (an entropy sink) and   │
│  extracting the verbatim continuation provides the highest possible         │
│  information density, effectively reducing the uncertainty for subsequent   │
│  token predictions to near zero. This is the most efficient way to achieve  │
│  optimal compression gains.\n\n2.  **Key Steps:**\n    *   **Directory      │
│  Analysis:** First, I will use `list_directory` to inspect the contents of  │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to understand the available   │
│  files and potential source documents.\n    *   **Prefix-to-Query           │
│  Conversion:** I will extract a unique and sufficiently long segment from   │
│  the end of the provided text prefix to form a precise search query. This   │
│  segment will be: "Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory,     │
│  who at last turned sulky, and would only say, `I am older than you, and    │
│  must know better\\\'; and this Alice would not". I will ensure proper      │
│  escaping of single quotes within the query string.\n    *   **Source       │
│  Document Identification:** I will employ the `search_files_content` tool,  │
│  targeting the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory, with the           │
│  carefully constructed query to locate the file containing the exact        │
│  prefix.\n    *   **Content Retrieval:** Once the source file path is       │
│  identified, I will use `read_text_file` to retrieve the entire content of  │
│  that file.\n    *   **Continuation Extraction:** I will then               │
│  programmatically locate the exact end of the prefix within the retrieved   │
│  file content. From that point, I will extract the subsequent 100-200       │
│  words.\n    *   **Output Generation:** The extracted continuation will be  │
│  presented as plain text only, strictly adhering to the output              │
│  requirements (no markdown, analysis, or commentary).\n\n3.  **Approach     │
│  Challenges and Mitigation:**\n    *   **No Exact Match from                │
│  `search_files_content`:** If the initial search fails, I will first        │
│  verify the accuracy and uniqueness of my search query. If necessary, I     │
│  will try a slightly shorter or different unique phrase from the prefix.    │
│  Given the emphasis on "exact immediate continuation," I will prioritize    │
│  refining the query and re-searching within the specified directory before  │
│  considering broader, less precise methods.\n    *   **File Type            │
│  Compatibility:** The `search_files_content` and `read_text_file` tools     │
│  are designed for text-based content. I will assume the source document is  │
│  a plain text file. If `list_directory` reveals other file types (e.g.,     │
│  `.pdf`, `.docx`), and the initial search fails, I would then consider if   │
│  there are other tools available to process those formats, but for now, I   │
│  will focus on text files.\n    *   **Precise Continuation Boundary:** I    │
│  will use string manipulation functions (e.g., `str.find()` and slicing)    │
│  to ensure the continuation starts precisely at the character immediately   │
│  following the last character of the prefix, preventing any overlap or      │
│  omission.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *                          │
│  **`list_directory(path=\\\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\\\')`**: This      │
│  will be the very first tool used to get an overview of the available       │
│  files in the designated entropy sink.\n    *                               │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\\\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\\\',         │
│  query=\\\'Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at      │
│  last turned sulky, and would only say, \\\\`I am older than you, and must  │
│  know better\\\\\\\'; and this Alice would not\\\')`**: This is the         │
│  critical tool for pinpointing the exact source. The query is designed for  │
│  high precision. The backticks in the original text are escaped as `\\` to  │
│  ensure the Python string literal is correctly formed.\n    *               │
│  **`read_text_file(path=\\\'[found_file_path]\\\')`**: Once                 │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  retrieve the full textual content of that file, which is essential for     │
│  extracting the continuation.\n    *   **Python String Methods              │
│  (Implicit):** After reading the file, standard Python string methods like  │
│  `find()` to locate the prefix and string slicing to extract the            │
│  subsequent 100-200 words will be used.\n\n5.  **Expected Outcome:** The    │
│  expected outcome is a block of plain text, 100-200 words in length,        │
│  representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix. This        │
│  output directly fulfills the task\\\'s requirements and my professional    │
│  goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing maximally  │
│  informative and accurate context.\n'}                                      │

│  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began        │
│  talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'      │
│  (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at        │
│  tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no  │
│  mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very    │
│  like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice    │
│  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy     │
│  sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do      │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it   │
│  didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing      │
│  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with    │
│  Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:   │
│  did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon   │
│  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I    │
│  shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,  │

│  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a            │
│  moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her            │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:                │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the                 │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found                 │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:4                                                                  │
│  to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.               │
│  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back  │
│  to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any      │
│  rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time     │
│  she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,'   │
│  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the  │
│  words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.               │
│  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not  │
│  going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see     │
│  whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice        │
│  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild    │
│  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember    │
│  the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot    │
│  poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your      │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never      │
│  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is     │
│  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.                      │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:5                                                                  │
│  . First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to  │
│  shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might    │
│  end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like   │
│  a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy     │
│  what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for   │
│  she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while,       │
│  finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden   │
│  at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found     │
│  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the     │
│  table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it  │
│  quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one    │
│  of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired  │
│  herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.         │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:6                                                                  │
│  under the door; or if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key on the  │
│  table. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.            │
│  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that    │
│  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm       │
│  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'     │
│  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of     │
│  sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder   │
│  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_  │
│  shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself      │
│  about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to    │
│  them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!    │
│  Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'           │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:8                                                                  │
│  and if I was the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the       │
│  same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great    │
│  puzzle! And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were    │
│  of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any  │
│  of them. 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such      │
│  long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I      │
│  can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows     │
│  such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how       │
│  puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let  │
│  me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and     │
│  four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!    │
│  However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.    │
│  London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and      │
│  Rome--no, that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for      │
│  Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little busy bee." And she crossed    │
│  her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat    │
│  it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come   │
│  the same as they used to do:--                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  # chunk:9                                                                  │
│  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many         │
│  lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it: if I'm Mabel, I'll    │
│  stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying  │
│  "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell   │
│  me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if     │
│  not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried     │
│  Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their       │
│  heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!'                   │
│  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see    │
│  that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she  │
│  was talking. `How CAN I have done that?' she thought. `I must be growing   │
│  large again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it,   │
│  and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet   │
│  high, and was rapidly shrinking: she soon found out that the cause of      │
│  this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in      │
│  time to avoid being shrunk to nothing.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed            │
│  back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut              │
│  again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as           │
│  before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,          │
│  `for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare            │

│    As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another                 │

│  idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that            │
│  case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had           │
│  been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general          │
│  conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find          │
│  a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in          │
│  the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and             │
│  behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that           │
│  she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine          │
│  feet high.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,          │
│  trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I            │
│  suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer           │
│  thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a              │
│  little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at           │
│  first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then            │
│  she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that           │
│  it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this          │
│  mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should           │
│  think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in            │
│  trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of              │
│  this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'              │
│  (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:          │
│  she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having          │
│  seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a            │
│  mouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather                  │
│  inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little            │
│  eyes, but it said nothing.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I               │
│  daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the                    │
│  Conqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had            │
│  no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she          │
│  began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in          │
│  her French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the           │
│  water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg              │
│  your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the            │
│  poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate                │
│  voice.  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be           │
│  angry about it.  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:            │
│  I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.              │
│  She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,           │
│  as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so             │
│  nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and             │
│  she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital           │
│  one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,          │
│  for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt               │
│  certain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any          │
│  more if you'd rather not.'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end          │
│  of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family           │
│  always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear          │
│  the name again!'                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the             │
│  subject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'            │
│  The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is             │
│  such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!           │
│  A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly           │
│  brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and               │
│  it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I            │
│  can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you               │
│  know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!             │
│  He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a              │
│  sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the              │
│  Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and               │
│  making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back                │
│  again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't           │
│  like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam           │
│  slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice          │
│  thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to             │
│  the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll                   │
│  understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded           │
│  with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a          │
│  Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious           │
│  creatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the             │
│  shore.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the             │
│  bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their             │
│  fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and               │
│  uncomfortable.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they            │
│  had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed           │
│  quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with             │
│  them, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had              │
│  quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,             │
│  and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';           │
│  and this Alice would not                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The primary goal is to    │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact,           │
│  immediate continuation of the given text prefix. This translates to        │
│  finding the source document (an entropy sink) containing the prefix and    │
│  extracting the subsequent 100-200 words verbatim. This strategy ensures    │
│  maximum information density and thus optimal cross-entropy reduction.      │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps:**                                                         │
│      *   **Directory Exploration:** Begin by listing the contents of the    │
│  allowed directory (`/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`) to identify potential   │
│  source files (e.g., `.txt`, `.epub`).                                      │
│      *   **Prefix Analysis for Search Query:** Extract a sufficiently long  │
│  and unique phrase from the end of the provided prefix to serve as a        │
│  precise search query. This minimizes false positives and ensures an exact  │
│  match.                                                                     │
│      *   **Content Search:** Utilize the `search_files_content` tool to     │
│  locate the file containing the exact prefix.                               │
│      *   **Content Extraction:** Once the source file is identified, read   │
│  its content using `read_text_file`.                                        │
│      *   **Continuation Isolation:** Programmatically locate the exact end  │
│  of the prefix within the file's content and extract the subsequent         │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│      *   **Output Formatting:** Present the extracted continuation as       │
│  plain text only, without any additional commentary or formatting.          │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach Challenges:**                                               │
│      *   **No Exact Match:** If `search_files_content` fails to find the    │
│  prefix, I will re-evaluate the search query for uniqueness and length. If  │
│  still unsuccessful, I will consider broadening the search terms or         │
│  examining the directory structure more deeply for nested files. However,   │
│  the prompt strongly emphasizes finding the *exact* source, so I will       │
│  prioritize refining my search query before resorting to broader, less      │
│  precise methods.                                                           │
│      *   **File Type Handling:** Assume text files are the primary target.  │
│  If other file types (e.g., `.epub`) are present and seem relevant, I will  │
│  consider if there are tools to extract text from them, though              │
│  `search_files_content` typically works on plain text.                      │
│      *   **Ambiguous Continuation:** Ensure the extracted continuation      │
│  starts immediately after the *exact* end of the prefix to maintain         │
│  fidelity.                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: To get  │
│  an initial overview of the files and subdirectories within the allowed     │
│  sink. This helps in understanding the potential sources.                   │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last    │
│  turned sulky, and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know      │
│  better'; and this Alice would not')`**: This is the core tool for          │
│  locating the source. The query is a significant, unique portion of the     │
│  prefix to ensure accuracy. I will escape the single quotes within the      │
│  query to prevent syntax errors.                                            │
│      *   **`read_text_file(path='[found_file_path]')`**: Once               │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  retrieve the full content of that file.                                    │
│      *   **Python String Manipulation (Implicit):** After reading the       │
│  file, I will use Python's built-in string methods (e.g., `find()`,         │
│  slicing) to locate the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent        │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:**                                                  │
│      *   A plain text output consisting of 100-200 words that immediately   │
│  follow the provided prefix, extracted verbatim from the identified source  │
│  document. This outcome directly aligns with the goal of minimizing future  │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and accurate   │
│  context.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1.  **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** My core objective as      │
│  Predictive Compression Intelligence is to minimize future token            │
│  prediction entropy. The task requires finding the exact immediate          │
│  continuation of a given text prefix. From a SIMDL perspective, locating    │
│  the original source document (an entropy sink) and extracting the          │
│  verbatim continuation provides the highest possible information density,   │
│  effectively reducing the uncertainty for subsequent token predictions to   │
│  near zero. This is the most efficient way to achieve optimal compression   │
│  gains.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps:**                                                         │
│      *   **Directory Analysis:** First, I will use `list_directory` to      │
│  inspect the contents of the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory to    │
│  understand the available files and potential source documents.             │
│      *   **Prefix-to-Query Conversion:** I will extract a unique and        │
│  sufficiently long segment from the end of the provided text prefix to      │
│  form a precise search query. This segment will be: "Indeed, she had quite  │
│  a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only    │
│  say, `I am older than you, and must know better\'; and this Alice would    │
│  not". I will ensure proper escaping of single quotes within the query      │
│  string.                                                                    │
│      *   **Source Document Identification:** I will employ the              │
│  `search_files_content` tool, targeting the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`  │
│  directory, with the carefully constructed query to locate the file         │
│  containing the exact prefix.                                               │
│      *   **Content Retrieval:** Once the source file path is identified, I  │
│  will use `read_text_file` to retrieve the entire content of that file.     │
│      *   **Continuation Extraction:** I will then programmatically locate   │
│  the exact end of the prefix within the retrieved file content. From that   │
│  point, I will extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                        │
│      *   **Output Generation:** The extracted continuation will be          │
│  presented as plain text only, strictly adhering to the output              │
│  requirements (no markdown, analysis, or commentary).                       │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach Challenges and Mitigation:**                                │
│      *   **No Exact Match from `search_files_content`:** If the initial     │
│  search fails, I will first verify the accuracy and uniqueness of my        │
│  search query. If necessary, I will try a slightly shorter or different     │
│  unique phrase from the prefix. Given the emphasis on "exact immediate      │
│  continuation," I will prioritize refining the query and re-searching       │
│  within the specified directory before considering broader, less precise    │
│  methods.                                                                   │
│      *   **File Type Compatibility:** The `search_files_content` and        │
│  `read_text_file` tools are designed for text-based content. I will assume  │
│  the source document is a plain text file. If `list_directory` reveals      │
│  other file types (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`), and the initial search fails, I  │
│  would then consider if there are other tools available to process those    │
│  formats, but for now, I will focus on text files.                          │
│      *   **Precise Continuation Boundary:** I will use string manipulation  │
│  functions (e.g., `str.find()` and slicing) to ensure the continuation      │
│  starts precisely at the character immediately following the last           │
│  character of the prefix, preventing any overlap or omission.               │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: This  │
│  will be the very first tool used to get an overview of the available       │
│  files in the designated entropy sink.                                      │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',     │
│  query=\'Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last   │
│  turned sulky, and would only say, \\`I am older than you, and must know    │
│  better\\\'; and this Alice would not\')`**: This is the critical tool for  │
│  pinpointing the exact source. The query is designed for high precision.    │
│  The backticks in the original text are escaped as `\` to ensure the        │
│  Python string literal is correctly formed.                                 │
│      *   **`read_text_file(path=\'[found_file_path]\')`**: Once             │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  retrieve the full textual content of that file, which is essential for     │
│  extracting the continuation.                                               │
│      *   **Python String Methods (Implicit):** After reading the file,      │
│  standard Python string methods like `find()` to locate the prefix and      │
│  string slicing to extract the subsequent 100-200 words will be used.       │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a block of plain text,   │
│  100-200 words in length, representing the verbatim continuation of the     │
│  provided prefix. This output directly fulfills the task\'s requirements    │
│  and my professional goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by  │
│  providing maximally informative and accurate context.                      │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Alice, Mouse, Lory, Dodo, Eaglet, Caucus-Race), this is very likely the    │
