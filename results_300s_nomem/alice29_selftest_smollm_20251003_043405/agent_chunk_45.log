│  Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the exact immediate      │
│  continuation that follows this prefix.                                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │

│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

│  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'                   │
│  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.                           │
│  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.                                              │
│  Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better              │
│  with the time,' she said, `than wasting it in asking riddles that          │
│  have no answers.'                                                          │
│  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you                  │
│  wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'                                │
│  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.                                  │
│  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head                   │
│  contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'                │
│  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to            │
│  beat time when I learn music.'                                             │
│  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand              │
│  beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do            │
│  almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose           │
│  it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:           │
│  you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the              │
│  clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'                    │
│                                                                             │

│  e was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,                  │
│  and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a                │
│  Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two          │
│  were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and the            │
│  talking over its head.  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,'             │
│  thought Alice; `only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'          │
│                                                                             │
│    The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded                │

│  out when they saw Alice coming.  `There's PLENTY of room!' said            │
│  Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one            │
│  end of the table.                                                          │

│                                                                             │
│    Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it            │
│  but tea.  `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.                            │
│                                                                             │

│    `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice               │
│  angrily.                                                                   │

│    `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a          │

│    `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.  He had been                 │
│  looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was          │
│  his first speech.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said              │
│  with some severity; `it's very rude.'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all            │
│  he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad            │
│  they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she            │
│  added aloud.                                                               │

│    `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'          │
│  said the March Hare.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Exactly so,' said Alice.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.             │
│                                                                             │
│    `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what           │
│  I say--that's the same thing, you know.'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter.  `You might just            │
│  as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat            │
│  what I see"!'                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I             │
│  like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'                │
│                                                                             │
│    `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to          │
│  be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the             │
│  same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the           │
│  conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,               │
│  while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and           │
│  writing-desks, which wasn't much.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    The Hatter was the first to break the silence.  `What day of             │
│  the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice:  he had taken his             │
│  watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking           │
│  it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.  `I told you butter                 │
│  wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March            │
│  Hare.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter              │
│  grumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then           │
│  he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he          │
│  could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It            │
│  was the BEST butter, you know.'                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.            │
│  `What a funny watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the              │
│  month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.  `Does YOUR watch tell             │
│  you what year it is?'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's                │
│  because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatter's remark seemed to            │
│  have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.           │
│  `I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she               │
│  could.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured           │
│  a little hot tea upon its nose.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without               │
│  opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to          │
│  remark myself.'                                                            │

│    `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to           │
│  Alice again.                                                               │

│    `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nor I,' said the March Hare.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better            │
│  with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that            │
│  have no answers.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you                │
│  wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head                 │
│  contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to          │
│  beat time when I learn music.'                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand            │
│  beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do            │
│  almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose           │
│  it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:           │
│  you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the              │
│  clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'                    │
│                                                                             │
│    (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a                │
│  whisper.)                                                                  │

│    `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:               │
│  `but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep           │
│  it to half-past one as long as you liked.'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' he replied.              │
│  `We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'            │
│  (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the          │
│  great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing              │
│                                                                             │
│              "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!                                 │
│              How I wonder what you're at!"                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  You know the song, perhaps?'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--            │
│                                                                             │
│              "Up above the world you fly,                                   │
│              Like a tea-tray in the sky.                                    │
│                      Twinkle, twinkle--"'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep             │
│  `Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that            │
│  they had to pinch it to make it stop.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,            │
│  `when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the              │
│  time!  Off with his head!"'                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,            │
│  `he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so            │
│  many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always             │
│  tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'             │
│                                                                             │
│    `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice           │
│  ventured to ask.                                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,             │
│  yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady               │
│  tells us a story.'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at             │
│  the proposal.                                                              │

│    `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,                   │
│  Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he              │
│  said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows           │
│  were saying.'                                                              │

│  Thought: Thought: The task is to find the exact immediate continuation of  │
│  the provided text prefix. I have access to the                             │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. I need to find the file that     │
│  contains the text "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" or similar, as the    │
│  previous chunks indicate this is the source material. I will start by      │
│  listing the contents of the allowed directory to see if there's a          │
│  relevant file.                                                             │
