│  Perspective):** The core objective is to minimize future token prediction  │
│  entropy by providing the exact, verbatim continuation of the given text    │
│  prefix. This is achieved by locating the source document and extracting    │
│  the subsequent 100-200 words. The text appears to be from "Alice\'s        │
│  Adventures in Wonderland," which suggests a high probability of finding    │
│  an exact match within accessible knowledge sources. The cost of tool       │
│  usage is justified by the significant entropy reduction achieved by        │
│  providing precise information.\n\n2. **Key Steps & Challenges:**\n    *    │
│  **Source Identification:** The primary challenge is to efficiently locate  │
│  the specific file containing the provided text prefix within the           │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.\n    *   **Content               │
│  Extraction:** Once the file is identified, the challenge is to accurately  │
│  extract the immediate 100-200 word continuation following the prefix.\n    │
│  *   **Output Format:** Ensure the output is strictly plain text, without   │
│  any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.\n\n3. **Approach to    │
│  Challenges (Leveraging Expertise):**\n    *   **Pattern Synthesis:** The   │
│  literary style and specific characters (Alice, Cat, Pig) strongly          │
│  indicate "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland." This knowledge guides the    │
│  search strategy towards finding a full text version of this book.\n    *   │
│  **Tool-Augmented Reasoning:** I will prioritize tools that can perform     │
│  content-based searches, as this is the most reliable way to pinpoint the   │
│  exact source, especially if file names are not immediately descriptive.\n  │
│  *   **Entropy Minimization:** By aiming for a verbatim continuation, I am  │
│  directly minimizing the cross-entropy for the subsequent tokens, as the    │
│  model will be able to predict them with very high confidence.\n\n4.        │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *   **Step 1: Confirm Allowed Directory:**  │
│  Although the directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` is provided, I will  │
│  use `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm my access and ensure no        │
│  misunderstandings about the scope.\n    *   **Step 2: Search for           │
│  Content:** I will use `search_files_content` to find the exact file        │
│  containing the prefix. A highly distinctive phrase from the end of the     │
│  prefix, such as "`I said pig,\' replied Alice;" will be used as the        │
│  search query to ensure precision. This tool is ideal for directly          │
│  locating the relevant document without needing to browse through numerous  │
│  files.\n    *   **Step 3: Read File Content:** Once the file path is       │
│  identified from the `search_files_content` output, I will use              │
│  `read_text_file` to read the entire content of that specific file. This    │
│  will allow me to locate the prefix and extract the continuation.\n    *    │
│  **Step 4: Extract Continuation:** After reading the file, I will           │
│  programmatically (or by careful manual inspection of the output if         │
│  necessary) find the exact end of the provided prefix and then extract the  │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:**\n    *   The         │
│  expected outcome is a block of plain text, consisting of 100-200 words,    │
│  which is the exact, verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from its  │
│  source document.\n    *   This outcome directly aligns with my goal of     │
│  minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing maximally          │
│  informative and accurate context.\n'}                                      │

│  There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the                  │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't               │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,              │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end: then stop.'                                      │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't            │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And             │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you                │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.              │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's              │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                 │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my             │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off             │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.                          │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having               │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                  │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half           │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's           │
│  getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she             │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about              │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their              │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it            │
│  was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up             │
│  and down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS              │
│  nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very           │
│  nearly carried it off.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a          │
│  hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it              │
│  does.'                                                                     │

│    `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very             │
│  glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her                  │
│  knowledge.  `Just think of what work it would make with the day            │
│  and night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn              │
│  round on its axis--'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'                │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant          │
│  to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and           │
│  seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four            │
│  hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?  I--'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide            │
│  figures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again,                │
│  singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a             │
│  violent shake at the end of every line:                                    │
│                                                                             │

│                  `Wow! wow! wow!'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept            │
│  tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing          │
│  howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--                       │
│                                                                             │
│          `I speak severely to my boy,                                       │
│            I beat him when he sneezes;                                      │
│          For he can thoroughly enjoy                                        │
│            The pepper when he pleases!'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│                      CHORUS.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│                  `Wow! wow! wow!'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said            │
│  to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.  `I must go and           │
│  get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of          │
│  the room.  The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,          │
│  but it just missed her.                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-           │
│  shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all              │
│  directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.  The poor              │
│  little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,          │
│  and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,            │
│  so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much            │
│  as she could do to hold it.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,                │
│  (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep               │
│  tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its            │
│  undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.  `IF I              │
│  don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure          │
│  to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it             │
│  behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing           │
│  grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't          │
│  grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing          │
│  yourself.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into             │
│  its face to see what was the matter with it.  There could be no            │
│  doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout              │
│  than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for           │
│  a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at            │
│  all.  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked           │
│  into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    No, there were no tears.  `If you're going to turn into a pig,           │
│  my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do             │
│  with you.  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed again (or              │
│  grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for             │
│  some while in silence.                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I            │
│  to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted              │
│  again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some            │
│  alarm.  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was              │
│  neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be            │
│  quite absurd for her to carry it further.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to          │
│  see it trot away quietly into the wood.  `If it had grown up,'             │
│  she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:          │
│  but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And she began               │
│  thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as           │
│  pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right          │
│  way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing             │
│  the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.             │
│                                                                             │
│    The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.  It looked good-                 │
│  natured, she thought:  still it had VERY long claws and a great            │
│  many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at            │
│  all know whether it would like the name:  however, it only                 │
│  grinned a little wider.  `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought              │
│  Alice, and she went on.  `Would you tell me, please, which way I           │
│  ought to go from here?'                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said             │
│  the Cat.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `I don't much care where--' said Alice.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk            │
│  long enough.'                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another           │
│  question.  `What sort of people live about here?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,           │
│  `lives a Hatter:  and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,            │
│  `lives a March Hare.  Visit either you like:  they're both mad.'           │
│                                                                             │
│    `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're all mad here.           │
│  I'm mad.  You're mad.'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on           │
│  `And how do you know that you're mad?'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad.  You grant              │
│  that?'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `I suppose so,' said Alice.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's          │
│  angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm          │
│  pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.'              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Call it what you like,' said the Cat.  `Do you play croquet             │
│  with the Queen to-day?'                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been            │
│  invited yet.'                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used            │
│  to queer things happening.  While she was looking at the place             │
│  where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat.  `I'd               │
│  nearly forgotten to ask.'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had            │
│  come back in a natural way.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it            │
│  did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the             │
│  direction in which the March Hare was said to live.  `I've seen            │
│  hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be              │
│  much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be          │
│  raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'  As she said          │
│  this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a             │
│  branch of a tree.                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `I said pig,' replied Alice;                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** The core objective is to   │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact, verbatim  │
│  continuation of the given text prefix. This is achieved by locating the    │
│  source document and extracting the subsequent 100-200 words. The text      │
│  appears to be from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," which suggests a    │
│  high probability of finding an exact match within accessible knowledge     │
│  sources. The cost of tool usage is justified by the significant entropy    │
│  reduction achieved by providing precise information.                       │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps & Challenges:**                                             │
│      *   **Source Identification:** The primary challenge is to             │
│  efficiently locate the specific file containing the provided text prefix   │
│  within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.                       │
│      *   **Content Extraction:** Once the file is identified, the           │
│  challenge is to accurately extract the immediate 100-200 word              │
│  continuation following the prefix.                                         │
│      *   **Output Format:** Ensure the output is strictly plain text,       │
│  without any additional formatting, analysis, or commentary.                │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges (Leveraging Expertise):**                      │
│      *   **Pattern Synthesis:** The literary style and specific characters  │
│  (Alice, Cat, Pig) strongly indicate "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."    │
│  This knowledge guides the search strategy towards finding a full text      │
│  version of this book.                                                      │
│      *   **Tool-Augmented Reasoning:** I will prioritize tools that can     │
│  perform content-based searches, as this is the most reliable way to        │
│  pinpoint the exact source, especially if file names are not immediately    │
│  descriptive.                                                               │
│      *   **Entropy Minimization:** By aiming for a verbatim continuation,   │
│  I am directly minimizing the cross-entropy for the subsequent tokens, as   │
│  the model will be able to predict them with very high confidence.          │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   **Step 1: Confirm Allowed Directory:** Although the directory      │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` is provided, I will use                     │
│  `list_allowed_directories()` to confirm my access and ensure no            │
│  misunderstandings about the scope.                                         │
│      *   **Step 2: Search for Content:** I will use `search_files_content`  │
│  to find the exact file containing the prefix. A highly distinctive phrase  │
│  from the end of the prefix, such as "`I said pig,' replied Alice;" will    │
│  be used as the search query to ensure precision. This tool is ideal for    │
│  directly locating the relevant document without needing to browse through  │
│  numerous files.                                                            │
│      *   **Step 3: Read File Content:** Once the file path is identified    │
│  from the `search_files_content` output, I will use `read_text_file` to     │
│  read the entire content of that specific file. This will allow me to       │
│  locate the prefix and extract the continuation.                            │
│      *   **Step 4: Extract Continuation:** After reading the file, I will   │
│  programmatically (or by careful manual inspection of the output if         │
│  necessary) find the exact end of the provided prefix and then extract the  │
│  subsequent 100-200 words.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:**                                                   │
│      *   The expected outcome is a block of plain text, consisting of       │
│  100-200 words, which is the exact, verbatim continuation of the provided   │
│  prefix from its source document.                                           │
│      *   This outcome directly aligns with my goal of minimizing future     │
│  token prediction entropy by providing maximally informative and accurate   │
│  context.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │
│                                                                             │
