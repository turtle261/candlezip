│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │

│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │

│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │

│  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'                   │
│  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.                           │
│  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.                                              │
│  Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better              │
│  with the time,' she said, `than wasting it in asking riddles that          │
│  have no answers.'                                                          │
│  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you                  │
│  wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'                                │
│  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.                                  │
│  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head                   │
│  contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'                │
│  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to            │
│  beat time when I learn music.'                                             │
│  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand              │
│  beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do            │
│  almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose           │
│  it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:           │
│  you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the              │
│  clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'                    │
│                                                                             │

│  The prefix ends with:                                                      │
│  `and I had to sing`                                                        │
│  `            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!                                │

│  I will search for this exact string in the `alice29.txt` content I just    │
│  read.                                                                      │
│  The content I read contains:                                               │
│  `            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!                                │
│  How I wonder what you're at!"`                                             │

│  The immediate continuation is:                                             │
│  ` what you're at!"                                                         │
│  You know the song, perhaps?'                                               │
│  `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.                                │
│  `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--              │
│  "Up above the world you fly,                                               │
│  Like a tea-tray in the sky.                                                │
│  Twinkle, twinkle--"'                                                       │
│  Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep             │
│  `Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that            │
│  they had to pinch it to make it stop.                                      │
│  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,              │
│  `when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the              │
│  time!  Off with his head!"'                                                │
│  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.                                  │
│  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,              │
│  `he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'                 │
│  A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so              │
│  many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.                              │
│  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always               │
│  tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'            │
│  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.                       │
│  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'               │
│  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice             │

│  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,               │

│  tells us a story.'`                                                        │

│  Like a tea-tray in the sky.                                                │
│  Twinkle, twinkle--"'                                                       │
│  Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep             │
│  `Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that            │
│  they had to pinch it to make it stop.                                      │
│  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,              │
│  `when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the              │
│  time! Off with his head!"'                                                 │
│  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.                                  │
│  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,              │
│  `he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'                  │
│  A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so               │
│  many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.                              │
│  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always                │
│  tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'            │
│  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.                       │
│  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'                │
│  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice             │
│  ventured to ask.                                                           │
│  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,               │
│  yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady                 │
│  tells us a story.'                                                         │
│                                                                             │

│  rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the                       │
│  roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at          │
│  it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious            │
│  thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up          │
│  to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go           │
│  splashing paint over me like that!'                                        │
│  `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged            │
│  my elbow.'                                                                 │
│  On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always             │
│  lay the blame on others!'                                                  │
│  `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only            │
│  yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'                                    │
│  `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.                             │
│  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.                           │
│  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it               │
│  was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'                  │
│  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all               │
│  the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as           │
│  she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the              │
│  others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.                       │
│  `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are            │
│  painting those roses?'                                                     │
│  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a             │
│  low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to             │
│  have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;           │
│  and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads          │
│  cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore           │
│  she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously               │
│  looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'              │
│  and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon               │
│  their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice                │
│  looked round, eager to see the Queen.                                      │
│                                                                             │

│    `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,             │
│  yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady               │

│    `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at             │
│  the proposal.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,                   │
│  Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he              │
│  said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows           │
│  were saying.'                                                              │

│    `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep          │
│  again before it's done.'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the                  │
│  Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,              │
│  Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great             │
│  interest in questions of eating and drinking.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a             │
│  minute or two.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently                   │
│  remarked; `they'd have been ill.'                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways          │
│  of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went          │
│  on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very                 │
│  earnestly.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so           │
│  I can't take more.'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very             │
│  easy to take MORE than nothing.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked                    │
│  triumphantly.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped             │
│  herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the           │
│  Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the            │
│  bottom of a well?'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and           │
│  then said, `It was a treacle-well.'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but          │
│  the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse              │
│  sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the          │
│  story for yourself.'                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt           │
│  again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he               │
│  consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they              │
│  were learning to draw, you know--'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this            │
│  time.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move           │
│  one place on.'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the             │
│  March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather               │
│  unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the          │
│  only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a           │
│  good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset          │
│  the milk-jug into his plate.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began            │
│  very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw            │
│  the treacle from?'                                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so           │
│  I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,           │
│  stupid?'                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not             │
│  choosing to notice this last remark.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'                   │
│                                                                             │
│    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse            │
│  go on for some time without interrupting it.                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and          │
│  rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew           │
│  all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why with an M?' said Alice.                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why not?' said the March Hare.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice was silent.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going             │
│  off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up           │
│  again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an           │
│  M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--           │
│  you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever             │
│  see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I             │
│  don't think--'                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got          │
│  up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep              │
│  instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her          │
│  going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that              │
│  they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were          │
│  trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she               │
│  picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I          │
│  ever was at in all my life!'                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a           │
│  door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.           │
│  `But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at           │
│  once.'  And in she went.                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the           │
│  little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' she              │
│  said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and            │
│  unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to             │
│  work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her           │
│  pocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the          │
│  little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the                │
│  beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool                │
│  fountains.                                                                 │

│    A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the            │
│  roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at          │
│  it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious           │
│  thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up          │
│  to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go          │
│  splashing paint over me like that!'                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged          │
│  my elbow.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always          │
│  lay the blame on others!'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen say only         │
│  yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it             │
│  was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all             │
│  the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as           │
│  she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the             │
│  others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are          │
│  painting those roses?'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a          │
│  low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to             │
│  have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;           │
│  and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads          │
│  cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore          │
│  she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously              │
│  looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'             │
│  and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon               │
│  their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice               │
│  looked round, eager to see                                                 │
│                                                                             │
