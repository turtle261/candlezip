│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │

│  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.                              │

│  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems            │
│  to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'                  │
│  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was                    │
│  written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                           │
│  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                          │
│  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,               │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │

│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │

│  My notion was that you had been                                            │

│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and your interest--                                                   │
│  However, what they'll do with you                                          │
│  I cannot imagine,                                                          │
│  But what will become of *it*?                                              │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more.'                                                │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown            │
│  so large in the last few minutes that she quite overlooked the             │
│  King,) `I'll give him sixpence.  *I* don't believe there's an atom         │
│  of meaning in it.'                                                         │
│  The King said, `The jury must consider their verdict.'                     │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│  The prefix ends with:                                                      │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.`                              │

│  of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding          │
│  her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset            │
│  the week before.                                                           │

│    `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great                │
│  dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,           │
│  for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and             │
│  she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once           │
│  and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.                         │
│                                                                             │

│  voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--            │

│    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she            │
│  had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing            │
│  was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable          │
│  to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that           │
│  it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it                │
│  would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'          │
│                                                                             │

│  being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and               │
│  handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write             │
│  out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed           │
│  too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,              │

│  They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when          │

│  of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and            │

│    `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and            │
│  went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--              │

│  sounded best.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some                     │
│  `unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to            │
│  look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she                 │
│  thought to herself.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily               │
│  writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out              │
│  from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE              │
│  HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Everybody looked at Alice.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.                                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `You are,' said the King.                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides,                 │
│  that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.                       │
│                                                                             │
│    `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.                            │
│                                                                             │
│    The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.                    │
│  `Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling          │
│  voice.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said           │
│  the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has             │
│  just been picked up.'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `What's in it?' said the Queen.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems          │
│  to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was                  │
│  written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,             │
│  there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper            │
│  as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set          │
│  of verses.'                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of               │
│  they jurymen.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the                │
│  queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.             │
│  (The jury all brightened up again.)                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and           │
│  they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the             │
│  matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd            │
│  have signed your name like an honest man.'                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the               │
│  first really clever thing the King had said that day.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't            │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Read them,' said the King.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│    The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,           │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on              │
│  till you come to the end:  then stop.'                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                           │
│                                                                             │
│          `They told me you had been to her,                                 │
│            And mentioned me to him:                                         │
│          She gave me a good character,                                      │

│          If she should push the matter on,                                  │
│            What would become of you?                                        │

│            Though they were mine before.                                    │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
│  falling down a very deep well.                                             │

 Tool search_files_content accepts these inputs: Tool Name: search_files_content
Tool Arguments: {'properties': {'excludePatterns': {'anyOf': [], 'default': None, 'description': 'Optional list of patterns to exclude from the search.', 'enum': None, 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'properties': {}, 'title': ''}, 'is_regex': {'anyOf': [], 'default': None, 'description': 'Whether the query is a regular expression. If false, the query as plain text. (Default : false)', 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': ''}, 'max_bytes': {'anyOf': [], 'default': None, 'description': 'Maximum file size (in bytes) to include in the search (optional).', 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': ''}, 'min_bytes': {'anyOf': [], 'default': None, 'description': 'Minimum file size (in bytes) to include in the search (optional).', 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': ''}, 'path': {'anyOf': [], 'description': 'The file or directory path to search in.', 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': '', 'type': 'string'}, 'pattern': {'anyOf': [], 'description': 'The file glob pattern to match (e.g., "*.rs").', 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': '', 'type': 'string'}, 'query': {'anyOf': [], 'description': "Text or regex pattern to find in file contents (e.g., 'TODO' or '^function\\\\s+').", 'enum': None, 'items': None, 'properties': {}, 'title': '', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['path', 'pattern', 'query'], 'title': 'DynamicModel', 'type': 'object'}
Tool Description: Searches for text or regex patterns in the content of files matching matching a GLOB pattern.Returns detailed matches with file path, line number, column number and a preview of matched text.By default, it performs a literal text search; if the 'is_regex' parameter is set to true, it performs a regular expression (regex) search instead.Optional 'min_bytes' and 'max_bytes' arguments can be used to filter files by size, ensuring that only files within the specified byte range are included in the search. Ideal for finding specific code, comments, or text when you don’t know their exact location.

│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│                                                                             │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│                                                                             │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │

│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about             │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their             │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│                                                                             │

│  Final Output: knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some  │

│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he    │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)                      │
│                                                                             │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the      │
│  verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of         │
│  course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he   │

│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts   │
│  on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                          │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my            │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off            │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│                                                                             │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│                                                                             │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'           │
│                                                                             │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having              │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │

│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                 │
│                                                                             │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half          │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │

│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's          │
│  getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she            │

The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)

`All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'

`But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.

`Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my
dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.

`Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)

`Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round
the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.

`It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and
everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the
King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

`No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'

`Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having
the sentence first!'

`Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.

`I won't!' said Alice.

`Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
Nobody moved.

`Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full
size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face.

`Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long
sleep you've had!'

`Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and
when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a
curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's
getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sister's dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's
slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-
bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about
her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
