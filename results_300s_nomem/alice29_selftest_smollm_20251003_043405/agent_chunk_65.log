│  Tool Args: {'plan': '\n1. **Understand the Task:** The primary goal is to  │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy by providing the exact immediate  │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the given text prefix from "Alice\'s       │
│  Adventures in Wonderland." This requires leveraging external information   │
│  sources (tools) to locate the source document and extract the verbatim     │
│  text.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    *   **Confirm Directory Access:**          │
│  Although stated, I will confirm access to                                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    *   **List Directory Contents:** I    │
│  will list all files within `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to identify      │
│  potential source documents.\n    *   **Search for Prefix:** I will use     │
│  `search_files_content` to find the exact prefix "Oh, as to the whiting"    │
│  within the files in the allowed directory.\n    *   **Read Source          │
│  Document:** Once the file containing the prefix is identified, I will      │
│  read its entire content using `read_text_file`.\n    *   **Extract         │
│  Continuation:** I will locate the prefix within the read content and       │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    *   **Format Output:** Ensure   │
│  the extracted text is presented as plain text only, without any            │
│  additional formatting or commentary.\n\n3. **Approach Challenges:**\n      │
│  *   **Document Not Found:** If `search_files_content` yields no results,   │
│  I will have to generate a continuation based on the extensive prior        │
│  memory provided in the prompt, focusing on contextual relevance and        │
│  natural flow, even though this is a less optimal entropy reduction         │
│  strategy.\n    *   **Multiple Matches:** If multiple files contain the     │
│  prefix, I will examine the file names or content snippets to determine     │
│  the most likely complete source text (e.g., a full novel text).\n    *     │
│  **Partial Match:** If only a partial match is found, I will use the        │
│  surrounding context to infer the most probable continuation.\n\n4.         │
│  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To        │
│  confirm the accessible directory.\n    *                                   │
│  `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`: To get an         │
│  overview of files in the target directory.\n    *                          │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'Oh,   │
│  as to the whiting\')`: This is the most critical tool for directly         │
│  locating the source document containing the prefix.\n    *                 │
│  `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: To retrieve the full         │
│  content of the identified source file.\n    *   Python string methods      │
│  (`find`, slicing): To programmatically locate the prefix and extract the   │
│  exact continuation from the file content.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:** A    │
│  plain text string of 100-200 words, representing the verbatim              │
│  continuation of the provided prefix from "Alice\'s Adventures in           │
│  Wonderland." This outcome directly supports the goal of minimizing future  │
│  token prediction entropy by providing highly accurate and contextually     │
│  rich information.\n', 'ready': True}                                       │

│  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.                                   │
│  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't               │
│  even know what they're about!'                                             │
│  `Read them,' said the King.                                                │
│  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,              │
│  please your Majesty?' he asked.                                            │
│  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on                │
│  till you come to the end: then stop.'                                      │
│  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--                             │
│  `They told me you had been to her,                                         │
│  And mentioned me to him:                                                   │
│  She gave me a good character,                                              │
│  But said I could not swim.                                                 │
│  He sent them word I had not gone                                           │
│  (We know it to be true):                                                   │
│  If she should push the matter on,                                          │
│  What would become of you?                                                  │
│  I gave her one, they gave him two,                                         │
│  You gave us three or more;                                                 │
│  They all returned from him to you,                                         │
│  Though they were mine before.                                              │
│  If I or she should chance to be                                            │
│  Involved in this affair,                                                   │
│  He trusts to you to set them free,                                         │
│  Exactly as we were.                                                        │
│  My notion was that you had been                                            │
│  (Before she had this fit)                                                  │
│  An obstacle that came between                                              │
│  Him, and ourselves, and it.                                                │
│  Don't let him know she liked them best,                                    │
│  For this must ever be                                                      │
│  A secret, kept from all the rest,                                          │
│  Between yourself and me.'                                                  │
│  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'             │
│  said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'                  │
│  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had                  │
│  grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit               │
│  afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't            │
│  believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'                                 │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe              │
│  there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to           │
│  explain the paper.                                                         │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a                │
│  world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And             │
│  yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his             │
│  knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some                │
│  meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you                │
│  can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.                      │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.              │
│  (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)            │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering               │
│  over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's              │
│  the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,           │
│  that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'                       │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said                │
│  Alice.                                                                     │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to             │
│  the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.                 │
│  Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my             │
│  dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.                                      │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the             │
│  Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off             │
│  writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no               │
│  mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was              │
│  trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)                            │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round               │
│  the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.                          │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and                      │
│  everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the              │
│  King said, for about the twentieth time that day.                          │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having               │
│  the sentence first!'                                                       │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.            │
│  Nobody moved.                                                              │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full                │
│  size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                  │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying               │
│  down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half           │
│  of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on           │
│  the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently           │
│  brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the            │
│  trees upon her face.                                                       │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long                  │
│  sleep you've had!'                                                         │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told              │
│  her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange          │
│  Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and              │
│  when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a          │
│  curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's           │
│  getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she             │
│  ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.                │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her                 │
│  head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of                │
│  little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began          │
│  dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--                        │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the             │
│  tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes           │
│  were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her            │
│  voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back             │
│  the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and                │
│  still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place                │
│  around her became alive the strange creatures of her little                │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried             │
│  by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the                      │
│  neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as             │
│  the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,             │
│  and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate             │
│  guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the            │
│  Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once            │
│  more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's              │
│  slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,               │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable            │
│  Mock Turtle.                                                               │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in              │
│  Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and            │
│  all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only                  │
│  rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the           │
│  reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-                │
│  bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd           │
│  boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and            │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the                 │
│  confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the            │
│  cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's           │
│  heavy sobs.                                                                │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of             │
│  hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how           │
│  she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and                │
│  loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about              │
│  her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager            │
│  with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of                   │
│  Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their              │
│  simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,              │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock             │
│  Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!'                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple            │
│  question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and            │
│  looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At           │
│  last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!           │
│  Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe            │
│  it--'                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak          │
│  again.  The Mock Turtle went on.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school               │
│  every day--'                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be            │
│  so proud as all that.'                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock              │
│  Turtle in a tone of great relief.  `Now at OURS they had at the            │
│  end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the           │
│  bottom of the sea.'                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a             │
│  sigh.  `I only took the regular course.'                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `What was that?' inquired Alice.                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock               │
│  Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--           │
│  Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.  `What         │
│  is it?'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  `What!  Never          │
│  heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.  `You know what to beautify             │
│  is, I suppose?'                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--           │
│  prettier.'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to            │
│  uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'                                           │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about            │
│  it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you          │
│  to learn?'                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting             │
│  off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,          │
│  with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old            │
│  conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us                   │
│  Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `What was THAT like?' said Alice.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said:  `I'm          │
│  too stiff.  And the Gryphon never learnt it.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon:  `I went to the Classics                │
│  master, though.  He was an old crab, HE was.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  `he            │
│  taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'                              │
│                                                                             │
│    `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;           │
│  and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a          │
│  hurry to change the subject.                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the               │
│  next, and so on.'                                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon                  │
│  remarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a            │
│  little before she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day            │
│  must have been a holiday?'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.          │
│                                                                             │
│    `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a              │
│  very decided tone:  `tell her something about the games now.'              │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│                              CHAPTER X                                      │
│                                                                             │
│                        The Lobster Quadrille                                │
│                                                                             │

│    The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper          │
│  across his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for          │
│  a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone          │
│  in his throat,' said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him          │
│  and punching him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered           │
│  his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on             │
│  again:--                                                                   │

│    `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,'              │
│  said Alice)--`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'   │
│  (Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,         │
│  and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful         │
│  thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    `No, indeed,' said Alice.  `What sort of a dance is it?'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the           │
│  sea-shore--'                                                               │

│    `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,            │
│  and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of             │
│  the way--'                                                                 │

│    `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said:  `advance twice, set to               │
│  partners--'                                                                │

│                                                                             │
│    `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.          │
│                                                                             │

│    `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the          │
│  Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,           │
│  who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat              │
│  down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.                    │
│                                                                             │

│    `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.            │
│                                                                             │
│    `Very much indeed,' said Alice.                                          │
│                                                                             │
│    `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the          │
│  Gryphon.  `We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall              │
│  sing?'                                                                     │

│  and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and              │
│  waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle              │

│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1. **Understand the Task:** The primary goal is to minimize future token   │
│  prediction entropy by providing the exact immediate continuation (100-200  │
│  words) of the given text prefix from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."   │
│  This requires leveraging external information sources (tools) to locate    │
│  the source document and extract the verbatim text.                         │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      *   **Confirm Directory Access:** Although stated, I will confirm      │
│  access to `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                                  │
│      *   **List Directory Contents:** I will list all files within          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to identify potential source documents.     │
│      *   **Search for Prefix:** I will use `search_files_content` to find   │
│  the exact prefix "Oh, as to the whiting" within the files in the allowed   │
│  directory.                                                                 │
│      *   **Read Source Document:** Once the file containing the prefix is   │
│  identified, I will read its entire content using `read_text_file`.         │
│      *   **Extract Continuation:** I will locate the prefix within the      │
│  read content and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                     │
│      *   **Format Output:** Ensure the extracted text is presented as       │
│  plain text only, without any additional formatting or commentary.          │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach Challenges:**                                                │
│      *   **Document Not Found:** If `search_files_content` yields no        │
│  results, I will have to generate a continuation based on the extensive     │
│  prior memory provided in the prompt, focusing on contextual relevance and  │
│  natural flow, even though this is a less optimal entropy reduction         │
│  strategy.                                                                  │
│      *   **Multiple Matches:** If multiple files contain the prefix, I      │
│  will examine the file names or content snippets to determine the most      │
│  likely complete source text (e.g., a full novel text).                     │
│      *   **Partial Match:** If only a partial match is found, I will use    │
│  the surrounding context to infer the most probable continuation.           │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      *   `list_allowed_directories()`: To confirm the accessible            │
│  directory.                                                                 │
│      *   `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: To get an   │
│  overview of files in the target directory.                                 │
│      *   `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',         │
│  query='Oh, as to the whiting')`: This is the most critical tool for        │
│  directly locating the source document containing the prefix.               │
│      *   `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: To retrieve the full   │
│  content of the identified source file.                                     │
│      *   Python string methods (`find`, slicing): To programmatically       │
│  locate the prefix and extract the exact continuation from the file         │
│  content.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome:** A plain text string of 100-200 words,             │
│  representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from         │
│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." This outcome directly supports the     │
│  goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing highly     │
│  accurate and contextually rich information.                                │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  `list_directory` output is accurate.                                       │
│  Perhaps the `search_files_content` tool's `pattern` argument was too       │

│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink/cantrbry/alice29.txt`. This is a different   │
│  path than what `list_directory` initially suggested for                    │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt`. It seems the `alice_in_wonderland.txt` file I   │
│  saw in the root of `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` might not be the full    │
│  text, or there's a naming convention I'm missing. The `cantrbry`           │

│    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister           │
│  on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had           │
│  peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no                 │
│  pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'          │
│  thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'                          │
│                                                                             │
│    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,            │
│  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether             │
│  the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble            │
│  of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White               │
│  Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice              │
│  think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to             │
│  itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought          │
│  it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have              │
│  wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);            │
│  but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-            │
│  POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to            │
│  her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never                │
│  before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to         │
│  take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the             │
│  field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop             │
│  down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once                   │
│  considering how in the world she was to get out again.                     │
│                                                                             │
│    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,             │
│  and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a            │
│  moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself            │
