│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** My    │
│  core objective is to minimize future token prediction entropy. This task   │
│  specifically requires finding the exact, verbatim continuation of a given  │
│  text prefix. From a SIMDL framework, this means leveraging external        │
│  information sources (the file system via MCP tools) to retrieve the        │
│  precise sequence of tokens, thereby providing the highest possible         │
│  information gain and reducing the description length for subsequent        │
│  predictions. The cost of accessing this information is justified by the    │
│  significant entropy reduction.\n\n2. **Key Steps:**\n    a. **Confirm      │
│  Access:** Verify the allowed directory to ensure operational scope.\n      │
│  b. **Identify Source Material:** Recognize the provided text prefix as     │
│  originating from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.\n   │
│  c. **Locate File:** Systematically search the designated directory for a   │
│  file containing this specific text.\n    d. **Extract Continuation:**      │
│  Once the file is identified, locate the exact prefix within it and         │
│  extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n    e. **Format Output:** Present   │
│  the extracted text as plain text, strictly adhering to the output          │
│  requirements (no markdown, analysis, etc.).\n\n3. **Approach to            │
│  Challenges:**\n    a. **File Discovery:** If a direct search for the book  │
│  title is too broad or fails, I will use a highly specific phrase from the  │
│  *end* of the provided prefix to pinpoint the exact location within any     │
│  text files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This ensures   │
│  I find the correct context for the immediate continuation.\n    b.         │
│  **Content Extraction:** If the file is large, I will use `read_text_file`  │
│  to get the full content and then programmatically find the prefix and      │
│  extract the subsequent text.\n    c. **Tool Failure (Fallback):** If,      │
│  despite aggressive tool usage, no exact source is found within the         │
│  allowed directory, I will generate a highly specific, context-aware        │
│  continuation based *only* on the provided prefix, avoiding generic         │
│  phrases and focusing on maintaining the narrative style and content.       │
│  However, this is a last resort, as tool-augmented retrieval is             │
│  prioritized for entropy minimization.\n\n4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    │
│  a. **`list_allowed_directories()`:** To confirm the accessible directory:  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.\n    b.                                    │
│  **`list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`:** To get an     │
│  initial overview of the files present in the sink directory. This helps    │
│  in identifying potential candidates for the source document.\n    c.       │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\', query=\'I   │
│  wonder if I\\\'ve been changed in the night? Let me think\')`:** This is   │
│  the most critical step. I will use a unique and specific phrase from the   │
│  *very end* of the provided prefix to directly locate the file and the      │
│  precise position of the prefix within it. This minimizes search space and  │
│  maximizes the chance of finding the exact continuation.\n    d.            │
│  **`read_text_file(file_path=\'...\')`:** Once `search_files_content`       │
│  returns a file path, I will use `read_text_file` to retrieve the entire    │
│  content of that file.\n    e. **Python string manipulation (internal):**   │
│  After reading the file, I will use string methods (e.g., `find()`,         │
│  slicing) to locate the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200           │
│  words.\n\n5. **Expected Outcome and Alignment:**\n    *   **Outcome:** A   │
│  plain text string, 100-200 words in length, representing the exact,        │
│  verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from "Alice\'s Adventures in  │
│  Wonderland".\n    *   **Alignment with Goal:** This outcome directly       │
│  aligns with my primary goal of minimizing future token prediction          │
│  entropy. By providing the precise next tokens from the original source, I  │
│  enable the language model to assign maximum probability mass to the        │
│  correct sequence, thereby achieving optimal compression under the SIMDL    │
│  framework. This is the most informative context possible.\n', 'ready':     │

│  empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody       │
│  underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell     │
│  past it.                                                                   │
│  `Well!' thought Alice to herself. `After such a fall as this, I shall      │
│  think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at   │
│  home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top    │
│  of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)                               │
│  Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end? `I wonder how many  │
│  miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. `I must be getting        │
│  somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four     │
│  thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several    │
│  things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though she had   │
│  not much use for them, as there was no opportunity of showing off her      │
│  knowledge anywhere, still it was a nice sort of thing to invent something  │
│  new, and say `Oh, what a clever girl I am!') `I wonder if I shall fall     │
│  right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the        │
│  people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--'    │
│  (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't   │
│  sound at all the right word) `--but I shall have to ask them what the      │
│  name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or    │
│  Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as    │
│  you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And    │
│  what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never   │
│  do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'                   │
│  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began        │
│  talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'      │
│  (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at        │
│  tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no  │
│  mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very    │
│  like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice    │
│  began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy     │
│  sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do      │
│  bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it   │
│  didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing      │
│  off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with    │
│  Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:   │
│  did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon   │
│  a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there WAS no one           │
│  listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I    │
│  shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,  │

│  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a            │
│  moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her            │
│  was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in                │
│  sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:                │
│  away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it             │
│  say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late             │
│  it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the                 │
│  corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found                 │
│  herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps            │
│  hanging from the roof.                                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.               │
│  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back  │
│  to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any      │
│  rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time     │
│  she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,'   │
│  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the  │
│  words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.               │
│  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not  │
│  going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see     │
│  whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice        │
│  little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild    │
│  beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember    │
│  the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot    │
│  poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your      │
│  finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never      │
│  forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is     │
│  almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  . First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to  │
│  shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might    │
│  end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like   │
│  a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy     │
│  what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for   │
│  she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while,       │
│  finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden   │
│  at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found     │
│  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the     │
│  table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it  │
│  quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one    │
│  of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired  │
│  herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.         │
│                                                                             │

│  under the door; or if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key on the  │
│  table. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.            │
│  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that    │
│  for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm       │
│  opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'     │
│  (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of     │
│  sight, they were getting so far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder   │
│  who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_  │
│  shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself      │
│  about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to    │
│  them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!    │
│  Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'           │
│                                                                             │

│  my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of             │
│  very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish                      │
│  I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only              │
│  know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things           │
│  had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few           │

│  to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort            │
│  of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast                │
│  turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished            │

│    And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and             │
│  her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right           │
│  size for going though the little door into that lovely garden.             │

│    `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to                │
│  herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'          │
│  She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very              │
│  seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so                  │
│  severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered          │
│  trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game            │
│  of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious               │
│  child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no          │
│  use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,          │
│  there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable                   │
│  person!'                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under             │
│  the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on           │
│  which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.              │
│  `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,          │
│  I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep          │
│  under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I              │
│  don't care which happens!'                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which              │
│  way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to              │
│  feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to              │
│  find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally          │
│  happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the             │
│  way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,              │
│  that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the              │
│  common way.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.                 │

│    `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much                  │
│  surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good          │
│  English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that             │
│  ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her               │
│  feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so          │
│  far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on              │
│  your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't          │
│  be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself            │
│  about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be          │
│  kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the              │
│  way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of               │

│  `They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll           │
│  seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the                 │

│    Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in              │
│  fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took            │
│  up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.               │
│                                                                             │
│    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one           │
│  side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get             │
│  through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to            │
│  cry again.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great              │
│  girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in             │
│  this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all             │
│  the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool          │
│  all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the           │
│  hall.                                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the                 │
│  distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.           │
│  It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a              │
│  pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the                │
│  other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to              │
│  himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she           │
│  be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate              │
│  that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit             │
│  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,           │
│  sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid                │
│  gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard            │
│  as he could go.                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very              │
│  hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:            │
│  `Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday               │
│  things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in            │
│  the night?  Let me think                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. **Understand the Task (SIMDL Perspective):** My core objective is to    │
│  minimize future token prediction entropy. This task specifically requires  │
│  finding the exact, verbatim continuation of a given text prefix. From a    │
│  SIMDL framework, this means leveraging external information sources (the   │
│  file system via MCP tools) to retrieve the precise sequence of tokens,     │
│  thereby providing the highest possible information gain and reducing the   │
│  description length for subsequent predictions. The cost of accessing this  │
│  information is justified by the significant entropy reduction.             │
│                                                                             │
│  2. **Key Steps:**                                                          │
│      a. **Confirm Access:** Verify the allowed directory to ensure          │
│  operational scope.                                                         │
│      b. **Identify Source Material:** Recognize the provided text prefix    │
│  as originating from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.   │
│      c. **Locate File:** Systematically search the designated directory     │
│  for a file containing this specific text.                                  │
│      d. **Extract Continuation:** Once the file is identified, locate the   │
│  exact prefix within it and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.           │
│      e. **Format Output:** Present the extracted text as plain text,        │
│  strictly adhering to the output requirements (no markdown, analysis,       │
│  etc.).                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  3. **Approach to Challenges:**                                             │
│      a. **File Discovery:** If a direct search for the book title is too    │
│  broad or fails, I will use a highly specific phrase from the *end* of the  │
│  provided prefix to pinpoint the exact location within any text files in    │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This ensures I find the      │
│  correct context for the immediate continuation.                            │
│      b. **Content Extraction:** If the file is large, I will use            │
│  `read_text_file` to get the full content and then programmatically find    │
│  the prefix and extract the subsequent text.                                │
│      c. **Tool Failure (Fallback):** If, despite aggressive tool usage, no  │
│  exact source is found within the allowed directory, I will generate a      │
│  highly specific, context-aware continuation based *only* on the provided   │
│  prefix, avoiding generic phrases and focusing on maintaining the           │
│  narrative style and content. However, this is a last resort, as            │
│  tool-augmented retrieval is prioritized for entropy minimization.          │
│                                                                             │
│  4. **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                               │
│      a. **`list_allowed_directories()`:** To confirm the accessible         │
│  directory: `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`.                                 │
│      b. **`list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`:** To get   │
│  an initial overview of the files present in the sink directory. This       │
│  helps in identifying potential candidates for the source document.         │
│      c. **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',        │
│  query='I wonder if I\'ve been changed in the night? Let me think')`:**     │
│  This is the most critical step. I will use a unique and specific phrase    │
│  from the *very end* of the provided prefix to directly locate the file     │
│  and the precise position of the prefix within it. This minimizes search    │
│  space and maximizes the chance of finding the exact continuation.          │
│      d. **`read_text_file(file_path='...')`:** Once `search_files_content`  │
│  returns a file path, I will use `read_text_file` to retrieve the entire    │
│  content of that file.                                                      │
│      e. **Python string manipulation (internal):** After reading the file,  │
│  I will use string methods (e.g., `find()`, slicing) to locate the prefix   │
│  and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  5. **Expected Outcome and Alignment:**                                     │
│      *   **Outcome:** A plain text string, 100-200 words in length,         │
│  representing the exact, verbatim continuation of the provided prefix from  │
│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".                                        │
│      *   **Alignment with Goal:** This outcome directly aligns with my      │
│  primary goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy. By providing   │
│  the precise next tokens from the original source, I enable the language    │
│  model to assign maximum probability mass to the correct sequence, thereby  │
│  achieving optimal compression under the SIMDL framework. This is the most  │
│  informative context possible.                                              │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Thought: The task requires me to find the exact continuation of   │
│  the provided text prefix. I know the text is from "Alice's Adventures in   │
│  Wonderland". My strategy is to first list the allowed directories to       │
│  confirm my working path, then list the contents of that directory to see   │
│  if the book is directly visible. If not, I will use                        │
│  `search_files_content` with a very specific phrase from the end of the     │
│  prefix to locate the exact file and then extract the continuation.         │
│  First, I'll list the allowed directories.                                  │

│  failed with a "No such file or directory" error, even though               │
│  `list_directory` showed it. This is a critical discrepancy. It's possible  │

│  might be slightly misleading (e.g., showing a symlink that points to       │

│  *correct* path to the file, which I can then use with `read_text_file`.    │
│  The last sentence of the prefix is: "I wonder if I've been changed in the  │
│  night? Let me think". I will use this as my query.                         │

│  Wonderland" and I saw a file named `alice_in_wonderland.txt`.              │
│  There are a few possibilities:                                             │
│  1.  The file `alice_in_wonderland.txt` might be corrupted or empty.        │
│  2.  The text in the file might have slight variations (e.g., different     │
│  punctuation, capitalization, or line breaks) that prevent an exact match   │
│  with my query.                                                             │
│  3.  The file might be in a subdirectory that `search_files_content` isn't  │
│  traversing correctly (though `pattern: "*.txt"` should cover it).          │
│  4.  The file `alice_in_wonderland.txt` might be a placeholder or an        │
│  incorrect version.                                                         │
│  Let's try a different approach. I will first verify the contents of        │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt.zip`. It's possible the `.txt` file is not the    │
│  correct one, but the `.zip` contains the actual book. I will unzip it to   │
│  a temporary directory and then search its contents.                        │
