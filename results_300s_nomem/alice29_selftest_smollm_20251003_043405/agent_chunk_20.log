│  Tool Args: {'plan': '1. Understanding the Task (Predictive Compression     │
│  Intelligence Perspective):\n   - The primary goal is to minimize future    │
│  token prediction entropy by providing the most accurate and informative    │
│  continuation of the given text prefix.\n   - The text prefix is            │
│  identified as a segment from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland," a        │
│  well-known public domain work.\n   - My role, under the SIMDL framework,   │
│  is to leverage external information sources (my available tools) as        │
│  entropy sinks to retrieve exact content, thereby reducing the model\'s     │
│  uncertainty about subsequent tokens.\n   - This task requires              │
│  "tool-augmented reasoning" to efficiently locate the source document       │
│  within the restricted file system.\n   - "Pattern synthesis" has already   │
│  helped identify the likely source material, guiding the search             │
│  strategy.\n\n2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:\n   - Step 1: Explore the  │
│  allowed directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` to identify potential     │
│  source files.\n   - Step 2: Search the content of the identified files     │
│  for the exact text prefix to pinpoint the source document.\n   - Step 3:   │
│  Once the source document is found, extract the immediate continuation      │
│  (100-200 words verbatim) following the prefix.\n   - Step 4: Format the    │
│  extracted continuation as plain text, adhering strictly to the output      │
│  requirements (no markdown, analysis, commentary, formatting, lists,        │
│  headings, or meta-text).\n\n3. Approach Challenges:\n   - Challenge:       │
│  Locating the exact source document within the specified directory.\n       │
│  - Approach: Utilize `search_files_content` with a unique and sufficiently  │
│  long segment of the prefix to ensure a precise match across all files in   │
│  the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This is more efficient than  │
│  reading each file individually and then searching.\n   - Challenge:        │
│  Extracting the exact continuation.\n     - Approach: Once the file is      │
│  identified, use `read_text_file` to get its full content. Then, use        │
│  Python string manipulation (`find` and slicing) to locate the end of the   │
│  prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words.\n\n4. Strategic Tool      │
│  Usage:\n   - `list_directory(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`:      │
│  This will be the initial step to get a list of all files and               │
│  subdirectories within the allowed sink directory. This helps in            │
│  understanding the structure and potential files to search.\n   -           │
│  `search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',               │
│  query=\'Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource\')`: This is    │
│  the most critical tool for finding the exact file containing the prefix.   │
│  The query will be the last sentence of the provided prefix to ensure high  │
│  specificity.\n   - `read_text_file(path=\'<found_file_path>\')`: Once      │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  read the entire content of that file.\n   - Python string methods          │
│  (`.find()`, slicing, `.split()`, `.join()`): These will be used            │
│  internally after `read_text_file` to precisely locate the end of the       │
│  prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words, then format them as a     │
│  plain text string.\n\n5. Expected Outcome:\n   - The expected outcome is   │
│  a plain text string, 100-200 words in length, representing the verbatim    │
│  continuation of the provided prefix. This output will be directly          │
│  extracted from the identified source document within the                   │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This precise and context-rich    │
│  information will allow the language model to assign higher probability     │
│  mass to the actual upcoming tokens, thereby reducing the expected          │
│  description length and aligning perfectly with the goal of minimizing      │
│  future token prediction entropy.', 'ready': True}                          │

│  Knave.                                                                     │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he    │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)                      │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the      │
│  verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of          │
│  course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he   │
│  did with the tarts, you know--'                                            │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.         │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts   │
│  on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE   │
│  HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the      │
│  Queen.                                                                     │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as   │
│  she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate  │
│  with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began     │
│  again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it      │
│  lasted.)                                                                   │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court     │
│  with a smile. There was a dead silence.                                    │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,   │
│  `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the        │
│  twentieth time that day.                                                   │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having the sentence  │
│  first!'                                                                    │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody     │
│  moved.                                                                     │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this   │
│  time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                               │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon     │
│  her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and       │
│  tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her      │
│  head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead      │
│  leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.               │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep you've     │
│  had!'                                                                      │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister,  │
│  as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers   │
│  that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her      │
│  sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly:     │
│  but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran    │
│  off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it  │
│  had been.                                                                  │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her     │
│  hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her   │
│  wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and     │
│  this was her dream:--                                                      │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands  │
│  were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up      │
│  into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer  │
│  little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always  │
│  get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the     │
│  whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little    │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the     │
│  frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she       │
│  could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends     │
│  shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen          │
│  ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby   │
│  was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed        │
│  around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the       │
│  Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,      │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock       │
│  Turtle.                                                                    │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,  │
│  though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to    │
│  dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool   │
│  rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to  │
│  tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the     │
│  shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and   │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused        │
│  clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the       │
│  distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.             │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers        │
│  would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would      │
│  keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her      │
│  childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and   │
│  make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even    │
│  with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all  │
│  their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,        │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │

│  chorus, `Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently,   │
│  and walked a little quicker.                                               │
│  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it             │
│  was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of            │
│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you          │
│  never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the              │
│  young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the                │
│  patience of an oyster!'                                                    │
│  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,              │
│  addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'              │
│  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'                │
│  said the Lory.                                                             │
│  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about              │
│  her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for              │
│  catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her           │
│  after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look            │
│  at it!'                                                                    │
│  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.                 │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began           │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts          │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │
│                                                                             │

│  Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.       │

│  The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill                                          │
│  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                   │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!           │
│  Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me                   │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have                │
│  dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was            │
│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │
│  the little door, had vanished completely.                                  │
│                                                                             │

│  `and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half            │
│  afraid that it would be offended again.                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to              │
│  Alice, and sighing.                                                        │
│                                                                             │
│    `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with            │
│  wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?'  And             │
│  she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so             │
│  that her idea of the tale was something like this:--                       │
│                                                                             │

│    `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.                  │
│                                                                             │

│  looking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'             │
│                                                                             │
│    `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up             │
│  and walking away.  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'               │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
│    `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after             │
│  it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but             │
│  the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little             │
│  quicker.                                                                   │

│    `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it           │
│  was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of            │
│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you          │
│  never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the              │
│  young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the                │
│  patience of an oyster!'                                                    │

│    `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,            │
│  addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'              │
│                                                                             │
│    `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'              │
│  said the Lory.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│    Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about            │
│  her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for              │
│  catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her           │
│  after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look            │
│  at it!'                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.               │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began           │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts          │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a              │
│  melancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm            │
│  sure she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I               │
│  wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice             │
│  began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.             │
│  In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of          │
│  footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping          │
│  that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to                │
│  finish his story.                                                          │
│                                                                             │

│    It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                 │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!           │
│  Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me                   │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have                │
│  dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was            │
│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │
│  the little door, had vanished completely.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│    Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,           │
│  and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE           │
│  you doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of          │
│  gloves and a fan!  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened          │
│  that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without           │
│  trying to explain the mistake it had made.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.          │
│  `How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!  But I'd               │
│  better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'          │
│  As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door           │
│  of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'                │
│  engraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried               │
│  upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,            │
│  and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and            │
│  gloves.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going                │
│  messages for a rabbit!  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on                │
│  messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that             │
│  would happen:  `"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready            │
│  for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see           │
│  that the mouse doesn't get out."  Only I don't think,' Alice went          │
│  on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering          │
│  people about like that!'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with          │
│  a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two          │
│  or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and          │
│  a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when           │
│  her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-             │
│  glass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'            │
│  but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know          │
│  SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,             │
│  `whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this              │
│  bottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for                │
│  really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:                 │
│  before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing          │
│  against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being          │
│  broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself                │
│  `That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I           │
│  can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so               │
│  much!'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and            │
│  growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in                 │
│  another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried             │
│  the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the          │
│  other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,          │
│  as a last resource                                                         │
│                                                                             │

│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│  1. Understanding the Task (Predictive Compression Intelligence             │
│  Perspective):                                                              │
│     - The primary goal is to minimize future token prediction entropy by    │
│  providing the most accurate and informative continuation of the given      │
│  text prefix.                                                               │
│     - The text prefix is identified as a segment from "Alice's Adventures   │
│  in Wonderland," a well-known public domain work.                           │
│     - My role, under the SIMDL framework, is to leverage external           │
│  information sources (my available tools) as entropy sinks to retrieve      │
│  exact content, thereby reducing the model's uncertainty about subsequent   │
│  tokens.                                                                    │
│     - This task requires "tool-augmented reasoning" to efficiently locate   │
│  the source document within the restricted file system.                     │
│     - "Pattern synthesis" has already helped identify the likely source     │
│  material, guiding the search strategy.                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Key Steps to Complete the Task:                                         │
│     - Step 1: Explore the allowed directory `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`  │
│  to identify potential source files.                                        │
│     - Step 2: Search the content of the identified files for the exact      │
│  text prefix to pinpoint the source document.                               │
│     - Step 3: Once the source document is found, extract the immediate      │
│  continuation (100-200 words verbatim) following the prefix.                │
│     - Step 4: Format the extracted continuation as plain text, adhering     │
│  strictly to the output requirements (no markdown, analysis, commentary,    │
│  formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text).                                │
│                                                                             │
│  3. Approach Challenges:                                                    │
│     - Challenge: Locating the exact source document within the specified    │
│  directory.                                                                 │
│       - Approach: Utilize `search_files_content` with a unique and          │
│  sufficiently long segment of the prefix to ensure a precise match across   │
│  all files in the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This is more    │
│  efficient than reading each file individually and then searching.          │
│     - Challenge: Extracting the exact continuation.                         │
│       - Approach: Once the file is identified, use `read_text_file` to get  │
│  its full content. Then, use Python string manipulation (`find` and         │
│  slicing) to locate the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent        │
│  100-200 words.                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  4. Strategic Tool Usage:                                                   │
│     - `list_directory(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`: This will be   │
│  the initial step to get a list of all files and subdirectories within the  │
│  allowed sink directory. This helps in understanding the structure and      │
│  potential files to search.                                                 │
│     - `search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',            │
│  query='Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource')`: This is the  │
│  most critical tool for finding the exact file containing the prefix. The   │
│  query will be the last sentence of the provided prefix to ensure high      │
│  specificity.                                                               │
│     - `read_text_file(path='<found_file_path>')`: Once                      │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  read the entire content of that file.                                      │
│     - Python string methods (`.find()`, slicing, `.split()`, `.join()`):    │
│  These will be used internally after `read_text_file` to precisely locate   │
│  the end of the prefix and extract the subsequent 100-200 words, then       │
│  format them as a plain text string.                                        │
│                                                                             │
│  5. Expected Outcome:                                                       │
│     - The expected outcome is a plain text string, 100-200 words in         │
│  length, representing the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix.     │
│  This output will be directly extracted from the identified source          │
│  document within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory. This         │
│  precise and context-rich information will allow the language model to      │
│  assign higher probability mass to the actual upcoming tokens, thereby      │
│  reducing the expected description length and aligning perfectly with the   │
│  goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy.                        │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Current Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the     │
│  exact immediate continuation that follows this prefix.                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │

│  sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'             │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe there's an   │
│  atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.   │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a world of       │
│  trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'   │
│  he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them      │
│  with one eye; `I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I    │
│  COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the       │
│  Knave.                                                                     │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he    │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)                      │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the      │
│  verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of          │
│  course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he   │
│  did with the tarts, you know--'                                            │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.         │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts   │
│  on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE   │
│  HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the      │
│  Queen.                                                                     │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as   │
│  she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate  │
│  with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began     │
│  again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it      │
│  lasted.)                                                                   │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court     │
│  with a smile. There was a dead silence.                                    │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,   │
│  `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the        │
│  twentieth time that day.                                                   │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having the sentence  │
│  first!'                                                                    │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody     │
│  moved.                                                                     │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this   │
│  time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                               │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon     │
│  her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and       │
│  tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her      │
│  head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead      │
│  leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.               │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep you've     │
│  had!'                                                                      │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister,  │
│  as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers   │
│  that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her      │
│  sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly:     │
│  but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran    │
│  off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it  │
│  had been.                                                                  │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her     │
│  hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her   │
│  wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and     │
│  this was her dream:--                                                      │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands  │
│  were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up      │
│  into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer  │
│  little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always  │
│  get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the     │
│  whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little    │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the     │
│  frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she       │
│  could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends     │
│  shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen          │
│  ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby   │
│  was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed        │
│  around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the       │
│  Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,      │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock       │
│  Turtle.                                                                    │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,  │
│  though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to    │
│  dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool   │
│  rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to  │
│  tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the     │
│  shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and   │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused        │
│  clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the       │
│  distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.             │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers        │
│  would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would      │
│  keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her      │
│  childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and   │
│  make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even    │
│  with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all  │
│  their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,        │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │
│  THE END                                                                    │

│  chorus, `Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently,   │
│  and walked a little quicker.                                               │
│  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it             │
│  was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of            │
│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you          │
│  never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the              │
│  young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the                │
│  patience of an oyster!'                                                    │
│  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,              │
│  addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'              │
│  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'                │
│  said the Lory.                                                             │
│  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about              │
│  her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for              │
│  catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her           │
│  after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look            │
│  at it!'                                                                    │
│  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.                 │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began           │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts          │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │

│  Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.       │
│  CHAPTER IV                                                                 │
│  The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill                                          │
│  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                   │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!           │
│  Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me                   │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have                │
│  dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was            │
│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │
│  the little door, had vanished completely.                                  │

│  `and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half            │
│  afraid that it would be offended again.                                    │
│    `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to              │
│  Alice, and sighing.                                                        │
│    `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with            │
│  wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?'  And             │
│  she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so             │
│  that her idea of the tale was something like this:--                       │
│                      `Fury said to a                                        │

│    `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.               │
│  `What are you thinking of?'                                                │
│    `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to            │
│  the fifth bend, I think?'                                                  │
│    `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.                  │
│    `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and           │
│  looking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'             │
│    `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up             │
│  and walking away.  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'               │
│    `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.  `But you're so easily           │
│  offended, you know!'                                                       │
│    The Mouse only growled in reply.                                         │
│    `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after             │
│  it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but             │
│  the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little             │
│  quicker.                                                                   │
│    `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it           │
│  was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of            │
│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you          │
│  never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the              │
│  young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the                │
│  patience of an oyster!'                                                    │
│    `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,            │
│  addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'              │
│    `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'              │
│  said the Lory.                                                             │
│    Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about            │
│  her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for              │
│  catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her           │
│  after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look            │
│  at it!'                                                                    │
│    This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.               │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began           │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts          │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │
│    `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a              │
│  melancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm            │
│  sure she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I               │
│  wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice             │
│  began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.             │
│  In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of          │
│  footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping          │
│  that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to                │
│  finish his story.                                                          │
│                             CHAPTER IV                                      │
│                  The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill                          │
│    It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                 │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!           │
│  Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me                   │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have                │
│  dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was            │
│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │
│  the little door, had vanished completely.                                  │
│    Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,           │
│  and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE           │
│  you doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of          │
│  gloves and a fan!  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened          │
│  that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without           │
│  trying to explain the mistake it had made.                                 │
│    `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.          │
│  `How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!  But I'd               │
│  better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'          │
│  As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door           │
│  of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'                │
│  engraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried               │
│  upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,            │
│  and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and            │
│  gloves.                                                                    │
│    `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going                │
│  messages for a rabbit!  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on                │
│  messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that             │
│  would happen:  `"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready            │
│  for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see           │
│  that the mouse doesn't get out."  Only I don't think,' Alice went          │
│  on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering          │
│  people about like that!'                                                   │
│    By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with          │
│  a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two          │
│  or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and          │
│  a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when           │
│  her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-             │
│  glass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'            │
│  but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know          │
│  SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,             │
│  `whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this              │
│  bottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for                │
│  really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'                 │
│    It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:                 │
│  before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing          │
│  against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being          │
│  broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself                │
│  `That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I           │
│  can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so               │
│  much!'                                                                     │
│    Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and            │
│  growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in                 │
│  another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried             │
│  the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the          │
│  other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,          │
│  as a last resource                                                         │
│  Thought: My previous attempts to find the prefix using                     │
│  `search_files_content` failed, even with a shorter query. This suggests    │
│  that the `search_files_content` tool might be case-sensitive or have       │
│  issues with special characters/line breaks, or the text in the file might  │
│  have subtle differences from the prefix.                                   │
│  To overcome this, I will read the entire `alice_in_wonderland.txt` file    │
│  and then perform a Python string search to find the exact prefix and       │
│  extract the continuation. This is a more robust approach when              │
│  `search_files_content` is not yielding results.                            │
│                                                                             │

│  Thought: Current Task: You MUST use MCP tools aggressively to find the     │
│  exact immediate continuation that follows this prefix.                     │
│  - Search for the source document or similar content to extract the next    │
│  100-200 words verbatim.                                                    │
│  - Use Wikipedia, search tools, and any available knowledge sources to      │
│  locate the full context.                                                   │
│  - If you find the exact source, copy the immediate continuation            │
│  word-for-word.                                                             │
│  - If no exact source is found, use search and knowledge tools to predict   │
│  the most likely next text based on context.                                │
│  - Prioritize accuracy and relevance over creativity.                       │
│  - Output MUST be plain text continuation only (no markdown, no analysis,   │
│  no commentary).                                                            │
│  - Avoid any formatting, lists, headings, or meta-text.                     │
│  - Focus on the immediate next words/sentences that naturally follow the    │
│  prefix.                                                                    │

│  - Generate a continuation based on the current prefix context only.        │
│  - Do NOT reuse previous chunk content - analyze the current prefix and     │
│  predict what would naturally follow.                                       │
│  - Make the continuation as specific to the current text as possible.       │
│  - Avoid generic text that could apply to any context.                      │
│  Prior memory (from earlier chunks):                                        │
│  inutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him   │
│  sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'             │
│  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe there's an   │
│  atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.   │
│  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a world of       │
│  trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'   │
│  he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them      │
│  with one eye; `I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I    │
│  COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the       │
│  Knave.                                                                     │
│  The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he    │
│  certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)                      │
│  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the      │
│  verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of          │
│  course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he   │
│  did with the tarts, you know--'                                            │
│  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.         │
│  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts   │
│  on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE   │
│  HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the      │
│  Queen.                                                                     │
│  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as   │
│  she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate  │
│  with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began     │
│  again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it      │
│  lasted.)                                                                   │
│  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court     │
│  with a smile. There was a dead silence.                                    │
│  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,   │
│  `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the        │
│  twentieth time that day.                                                   │
│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having the sentence  │
│  first!'                                                                    │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody     │
│  moved.                                                                     │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this   │
│  time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                               │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon     │
│  her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and       │
│  tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her      │
│  head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead      │
│  leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.               │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep you've     │
│  had!'                                                                      │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister,  │
│  as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers   │
│  that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her      │
│  sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly:     │
│  but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran    │
│  off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it  │
│  had been.                                                                  │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her     │
│  hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her   │
│  wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and     │
│  this was her dream:--                                                      │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands  │
│  were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up      │
│  into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer  │
│  little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always  │
│  get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the     │
│  whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little    │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the     │
│  frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she       │
│  could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends     │
│  shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen          │
│  ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby   │
│  was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed        │
│  around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the       │
│  Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,      │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock       │
│  Turtle.                                                                    │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,  │
│  though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to    │
│  dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool   │
│  rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to  │
│  tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the     │
│  shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and   │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused        │
│  clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the       │
│  distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.             │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers        │
│  would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would      │
│  keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her      │
│  childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and   │
│  make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even    │
│  with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all  │
│  their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,        │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │

│  upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,            │
│  and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and            │
│  gloves.                                                                    │
│    `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going                │
│  messages for a rabbit!  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on                │
│  messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that             │
│  would happen:  `"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready            │
│  for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see           │
│  that the mouse doesn't get out."  Only I don't think,' Alice went          │
│  on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering          │
│  people about like that!'                                                   │
│    By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with          │
│  a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two          │
│  or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and          │
│  a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when           │
│  her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-             │
│  glass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'            │
│  but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know          │
│  SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,             │
│  `whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this              │
│  bottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for                │
│  really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'                 │
│    It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:                 │
│  before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing          │
│  against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being          │
│  broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself                │
│  `That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I           │
│  can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so               │
│  much!'                                                                     │
│    Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and            │
│  growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in                 │
│  another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried             │
│  the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the          │
│  other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,          │
│  as a last resource                                                         │
│  Thought: I apologize for the repeated error. It seems the                  │
│  `list_directory` command is not showing the files directly in              │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`, but rather subdirectories. This implies    │
│  that `alice_in_wonderland.txt` might be within one of those                │
│  subdirectories, or my initial `list_directory` observation was             │
│  incomplete.                                                                │
│  Given the previous `list_directory` output showed                          │
│  `alice_in_wonderland.txt` and `alice_in_wonderland.zip` directly in        │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink`, and then a subsequent `list_directory`     │
│  showed only subdirectories, there might be an inconsistency or I'm         │
│  misinterpreting the output.                                                │
│  To be absolutely sure, I will try to read `alice_in_wonderland.txt`        │
│  directly from `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` again, assuming the initial   │
│  observation was correct and there was a transient issue or a typo in my    │
│  previous `read_text_file` attempt. If that fails, I will explore the       │
│  subdirectories.                                                            │
