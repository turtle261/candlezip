│  Tool Args: {'plan': '\n1.  **Understand the Task:** The core task is to    │
│  find the exact immediate continuation (100-200 words) of the provided      │
│  text prefix, which is from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland." My role    │
│  as Predictive Compression Intelligence is to minimize future token         │
│  prediction entropy by providing this maximally informative context. The    │
│  output must be plain text only.\n\n2.  **Key Steps:**\n    *   Analyze     │
│  the provided text prefix to confirm its source and identify a unique       │
│  search phrase.\n    *   Use available tools to search for this unique      │
│  phrase within the `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.\n    *   Upon  │
│  finding the source document, extract the verbatim continuation             │
│  immediately following the prefix.\n    *   Ensure the extracted            │
│  continuation is between 100-200 words and is in plain text format.\n\n3.   │
│  **Approach to Challenges:**\n    *   **File Not Found:** If the initial    │
│  search for the exact phrase fails, I will broaden the search slightly by   │
│  using a shorter, but still unique, phrase from the end of the prefix. If   │
│  the book is truly not in the allowed directory, I will have to generate a  │
│  contextually relevant continuation, but the prompt strongly implies the    │
│  source is available within the specified directory.\n    *   **Multiple    │
│  Matches:** If multiple files contain the phrase, I will read a small       │
│  portion of each surrounding the match to determine the correct source      │
│  based on the full context of the prefix.\n    *   **Extraction             │
│  Accuracy:** I will carefully identify the exact end of the prefix in the   │
│  source document and begin extraction immediately after it, ensuring no     │
│  overlap or omission.\n\n4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**\n    *               │
│  **`list_allowed_directories()`**: (Already known:                          │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink ONLY`) This confirms my operational          │
│  scope.\n    *                                                              │
│  **`directory_tree(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\')`**: This will be  │
│  the first tool used to get an overview of the files and subdirectories     │
│  within the allowed sink directory. This helps in understanding the         │
│  potential file types and organization, which can inform subsequent search  │
│  strategies.\n    *                                                         │
│  **`search_files_content(path=\'/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink\',             │
│  query=\'The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes      │
│  Bill!\')`**: This is the primary tool for locating the exact source        │
│  document. The query is a highly specific phrase from the end of the        │
│  prefix, maximizing the chance of a precise hit.\n    *                     │
│  **`read_text_file(file_path=\'...\')`**: Once `search_files_content`       │
│  returns a file path, this tool will be used to read the content of that    │
│  file. I will then manually extract the required continuation.\n\n5.        │
│  **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a plain text block of        │
│  100-200 words that is the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix     │
│  from "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland." This directly aligns with my     │
│  goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the most   │
│  accurate and information-dense context possible.\n', 'ready': True}        │

│  `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'            │
│  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having the sentence  │
│  first!'                                                                    │
│  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.                        │
│  `I won't!' said Alice.                                                     │
│  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody     │
│  moved.                                                                     │
│  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this   │
│  time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'                               │
│  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon     │
│  her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and       │
│  tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her      │
│  head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead      │
│  leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.               │
│  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep you've     │
│  had!'                                                                      │
│  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her sister,  │
│  as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers   │
│  that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her      │
│  sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly:     │
│  but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up and ran    │
│  off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it  │
│  had been.                                                                  │
│  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her     │
│  hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her   │
│  wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and     │
│  this was her dream:--                                                      │
│  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands  │
│  were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up      │
│  into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer  │
│  little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always  │
│  get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the     │
│  whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little    │
│  sister's dream.                                                            │
│  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the     │
│  frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she       │
│  could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends     │
│  shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen          │
│  ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby   │
│  was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed        │
│  around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the       │
│  Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,      │
│  filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock       │
│  Turtle.                                                                    │
│  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,  │
│  though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to    │
│  dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool   │
│  rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to  │
│  tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the     │
│  shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and   │
│  all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused        │
│  clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the       │
│  distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.             │
│  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers        │
│  would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would      │
│  keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her      │
│  childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and   │
│  make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even    │
│  with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all  │
│  their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,        │
│  remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.                 │

│  chorus, `Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently,   │

│  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it             │
│  was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of            │
│  saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you          │
│  never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the              │
│  young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the                │
│  patience of an oyster!'                                                    │
│  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,              │
│  addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'              │
│  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'                │
│  said the Lory.                                                             │
│  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about              │
│  her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for              │
│  catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her           │
│  after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look            │
│  at it!'                                                                    │
│  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.                 │
│  Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began           │
│  wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be            │
│  getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary          │
│  called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my            │
│  dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts          │
│  they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.                         │
│                                                                             │

│  Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.       │

│  The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill                                          │
│  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and                   │
│  looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;           │
│  and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!           │
│  Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me                   │
│  executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have                │
│  dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was            │
│  looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she              │
│  very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were            │
│  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her            │
│  swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and             │
│  the little door, had vanished completely.                                  │
│                                                                             │

│  she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said   │
│  to herself `Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of    │
│  me?' Luckily for Alice, the little bottle had by this time had its full    │
│  effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as   │
│  there seemed to be no chance of her ever getting out of the room again,    │
│  except by growing smaller again, she began to cry again.                   │
│                                                                             │

│  gloves and a fan!  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened          │
│  that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without           │
│  trying to explain the mistake it had made.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.          │
│  `How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!  But I'd               │
│  better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'          │
│  As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door           │
│  of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'                │
│  engraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried               │
│  upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,            │
│  and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and            │
│  gloves.                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going                │
│  messages for a rabbit!  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on                │
│  messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that             │
│  would happen:  `"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready            │
│  for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see           │
│  that the mouse doesn't get out."  Only I don't think,' Alice went          │
│  on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering          │
│  people about like that!'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with          │
│  a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two          │
│  or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and          │
│  a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when           │
│  her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-             │
│  glass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'            │
│  but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know          │
│  SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,             │
│  `whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this              │
│  bottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for                │
│  really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'                 │
│                                                                             │
│    It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:                 │
│  before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing          │
│  against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being          │
│  broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself                │
│  `That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I           │
│  can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so               │
│  much!'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and            │
│  growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in                 │
│  another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried             │
│  the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the          │
│  other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,          │
│  as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one             │
│  foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,            │
│  whatever happens.  What WILL become of me?'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full          │
│  effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,          │
│  and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting           │
│  out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.                         │
│                                                                             │
│    `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one          │
│  wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about          │
│  by mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone down that                │
│  rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,              │
│  this sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!              │
│  When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing              │
│  never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!  There             │
│  ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!  And when           │
│  I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a           │
│  sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more              │
│  HERE.'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I           │
│  am now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-          │
│  -but then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like          │
│  THAT!'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.  `How can you             │
│  learn lessons in here?  Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no           │
│  room at all for any lesson-books!'                                         │
│                                                                             │
│    And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,            │
│  and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few          │
│  minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.                  │
│                                                                             │
│    `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves              │
│  this moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the                 │
│  stairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and          │
│  she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she           │
│  was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no          │
│  reason to be afraid of it.                                                 │
│                                                                             │
│    Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;          │
│  but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed             │
│  hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it            │
│  say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'               │
│                                                                             │
│    `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she              │
│  fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly           │
│  spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not            │
│  get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,            │
│  and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was          │
│  just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something            │
│  of the sort.                                                               │
│                                                                             │
│    Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are            │
│  you?'  And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then             │
│  I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'                                │
│                                                                             │
│    `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!           │
│  Come and help me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.)             │
│                                                                             │
│    `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'                           │
│                                                                             │
│    `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.')            │
│                                                                             │
│    `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why, it               │
│  fills the whole window!'                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│    `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.'              │
│                                                                             │
│    `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it          │
│  away!'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│    There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear           │
│  whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer                │
│  honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at           │
│  last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in             │
│  the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more                │
│  sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there           │
│  must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for          │
│  pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I          │
│  don't want to stay in here any longer!'                                    │
│                                                                             │
│    She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at              │
│  last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a              │
│  good many voice all talking together:  she made out the words:             │
│  `Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;                │
│  Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up          │
│  at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half          │
│  high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-          │
│  -Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind            │
│  that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!  Heads below!' (a loud             │
│  crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go             │
│  down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,                │
│  then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to            │
│  go down the chimney!'                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│    `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said               │
│  Alice to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!            │
│  I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is          │
│  narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'                      │
│                                                                             │
│    She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and              │
│  waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what          │
│  sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close          │
│  above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one           │
│  sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.                      │
│                                                                             │
│    The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes            │
│  Bill!'                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│  Output: continuation (plain text only).                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  Reasoning Plan:                                                            │
│                                                                             │
│  1.  **Understand the Task:** The core task is to find the exact immediate  │
│  continuation (100-200 words) of the provided text prefix, which is from    │
│  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." My role as Predictive Compression      │
│  Intelligence is to minimize future token prediction entropy by providing   │
│  this maximally informative context. The output must be plain text only.    │
│                                                                             │
│  2.  **Key Steps:**                                                         │
│      *   Analyze the provided text prefix to confirm its source and         │
│  identify a unique search phrase.                                           │
│      *   Use available tools to search for this unique phrase within the    │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink` directory.                                  │
│      *   Upon finding the source document, extract the verbatim             │
│  continuation immediately following the prefix.                             │
│      *   Ensure the extracted continuation is between 100-200 words and is  │
│  in plain text format.                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  3.  **Approach to Challenges:**                                            │
│      *   **File Not Found:** If the initial search for the exact phrase     │
│  fails, I will broaden the search slightly by using a shorter, but still    │
│  unique, phrase from the end of the prefix. If the book is truly not in     │
│  the allowed directory, I will have to generate a contextually relevant     │
│  continuation, but the prompt strongly implies the source is available      │
│  within the specified directory.                                            │
│      *   **Multiple Matches:** If multiple files contain the phrase, I      │
│  will read a small portion of each surrounding the match to determine the   │
│  correct source based on the full context of the prefix.                    │
│      *   **Extraction Accuracy:** I will carefully identify the exact end   │
│  of the prefix in the source document and begin extraction immediately      │
│  after it, ensuring no overlap or omission.                                 │
│                                                                             │
│  4.  **Strategic Tool Usage:**                                              │
│      *   **`list_allowed_directories()`**: (Already known:                  │
│  `/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink ONLY`) This confirms my operational scope.   │
│      *   **`directory_tree(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink')`**: This    │
│  will be the first tool used to get an overview of the files and            │
│  subdirectories within the allowed sink directory. This helps in            │
│  understanding the potential file types and organization, which can inform  │
│  subsequent search strategies.                                              │
│      *   **`search_files_content(path='/C/Users/Noah/Documents/sink',       │
│  query='The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes       │
│  Bill!')`**: This is the primary tool for locating the exact source         │
│  document. The query is a highly specific phrase from the end of the        │
│  prefix, maximizing the chance of a precise hit.                            │
│      *   **`read_text_file(file_path='...')`**: Once                        │
│  `search_files_content` returns a file path, this tool will be used to      │
│  read the content of that file. I will then manually extract the required   │
│  continuation.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│  5.  **Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome is a plain text block of    │
│  100-200 words that is the verbatim continuation of the provided prefix     │
│  from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." This directly aligns with my      │
│  goal of minimizing future token prediction entropy by providing the most   │
│  accurate and information-dense context possible.                           │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │
